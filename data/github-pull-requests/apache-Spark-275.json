so as to cut the lineage completely to parent\r\n\r\n  ## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n  Dstream.reduceByKeyAndWindow() with inverse reduce functions eventually creates\r\n  a ReducedWindowDStream but did not checkpoint it.\r\n  When combined with the issue described in SPARK-25303,\r\n  it results in the problem described in the post here:\r\n\r\n  http://apache-spark-user-list.1001560.n3.nabble.com/DStream-reduceByKeyAndWindow-not-using-checkpointed-data-for-inverse-reducing-old-data-td33332.html\r\n\r\n  This change will checkpoint reducedStream inside to cut the lineage.\r\n  A separate patch is being created for the issue in SPARK-25303\r\n\r\n  ## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n  Running the existing Unit tests. A couple of existing unit test classes were\r\n  written assuming they will not be used in serialization. Had to declare\r\n  SparkContext as transient like other tests in order to make them work\r\n  due to new checkpointing causing serialization to occur.\r\n\r\n  ## What improvement does this patch make?\r\n\r\n  Cuts the lineage to the parent DStream. When combined with the fix\r\n  in SPARK-25303, unpersits the intermediate RDDs and Input DStreams that\r\n  were being remembered for too long, resulting in much lower memory usage\r\n  on the Executors after the fixes. Observed from the DAG chart differences and\r\n  data from the Storage tab on the Driver

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change aims to provide the very basic support to provision the executors with pex files (instead of conda or virtual env). It contains only the minimal required changes. Everything else can be setup with environment variables.\r\nSimilar to how it works today with conda the user needs to make sure that he has the same environment when submitting the Spark job and the environment provided in the pex file.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nVarious runs with spark-submit (client, cluster) and by directly creating a SparkContext on a Yarn Cluster.\r\n\r\nAlso tested with a unit test using a locally created pex file (inspired by python/pyspark/tests/AddFileTests). The issue is that pex files contain information about the platform/runtime and therefore I can't provide a generic test because of the check to have the same python minor version on the client and on executors. It would mean to create a pex file for every python runtime and every existing platform. I can provide some code in here in order to execute locally. Maybe it is also possible to use SparkSubmitTests ?\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-14T17:23:18Z","updated_at":"2019-05-15T17:54:03Z","closed_at":"2018-09-20T16:38:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"04e7bd07af41c3640a484baefecb2fbb427c5c21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22422/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22422/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22422/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c6900c65c07a5395bc8a2de03e580850acc79b27","head":{"label":"fhoering:pex-support-fix2","ref":"pex-support-fix2","sha":"c6900c65c07a5395bc8a2de03e580850acc79b27","user":{"login":"fhoering","id":13346472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ2NDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13346472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering","html_url":"https://github.com/fhoering","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":148631349,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDg2MzEzNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"fhoering/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fhoering","id":13346472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ2NDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13346472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering","html_url":"https://github.com/fhoering","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhoering/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fhoering/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose overriding session options by extra options in DataSource V2. Extra options are more specific and set via `.option()`, and should overwrite more generic session options. Entries from seconds map overwrites entries with the same key from the first map, for example:\r\n```Scala\r\nscala> Map(\"option\" -> false) ++ Map(\"option\" -> true)\r\nres0: scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,Boolean] = Map(option -> true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test for checking which option is propagated to a data source in `load()`.","created_at":"2018-09-13T15:23:00Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:33:19Z","closed_at":"2018-09-16T00:28:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"598bfd85764b2693944fded177dc703012cdda3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22413/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22413/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22413/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/325b9c4790213b567153d6c9f85ae65ff64cc8e2","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:session-options","ref":"session-options","sha":"325b9c4790213b567153d6c9f85ae65ff64cc8e2","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs described in [#SPARK-25404](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25404),  staging path may not on the right place we expect. I'm not quiet sure  in which case the `inputPathName` contains the `stagingDir`, but it seems `new Path(inputPathName, stagingDir).toString`  is enough.\r\n```scala\r\n    var stagingPathName: String =\r\n      if (inputPathName.indexOf(stagingDir) == -1) {\r\n        new Path(inputPathName, stagingDir).toString\r\n      } else {\r\n        inputPathName.substring(0, inputPathName.indexOf(stagingDir) + stagingDir.length)\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually test with debug mode, and check the staging files on right path.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-13T11:48:59Z","updated_at":"2020-01-08T00:07:24Z","closed_at":"2020-01-08T00:07:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a3301f55c798facfdf7a2022a45b8928134207b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22412/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22412/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22412/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a6d48558111b6968919a692f6b2d8a9095fc64a4","head":{"label":"fjh100456:master-StagingDir","ref":"master-StagingDir","sha":"a6d48558111b6968919a692f6b2d8a9095fc64a4","user":{"login":"fjh100456","id":26785576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg1NTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26785576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456","html_url":"https://github.com/fjh100456","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115198070,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTUxOTgwNzA=","name":"spark","full_name":"fjh100456/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fjh100456","id":26785576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg1NTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26785576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456","html_url":"https://github.com/fjh100456","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fjh100456/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn ArrayContains, we currently cast the right hand side expression to match the element type of the left hand side Array. This may result in down casting and may return wrong result or questionable result.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n```SQL\r\nspark-sql> select array_contains(array(1), 1.34);\r\ntrue\r\n```\r\n```SQL\r\nspark-sql> select array_contains(array(1), 'foo');\r\nnull\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should safely coerce both left and right hand side expressions.\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn ArrayPosition, we currently cast the right hand side expression to match the element type of the left hand side Array. This may result in down casting and may return wrong result or questionable result.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n```SQL\r\nspark-sql> select array_position(array(1), 1.34);\r\n1\r\n```\r\n```SQL\r\nspark-sql> select array_position(array(1), 'foo');\r\nnull\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should safely coerce both left and right hand side expressions.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn RuleExecutor, after applying a rule, if the plan has changed, the before and after plan will be logged using level \"trace\". At times, however, such information can be very helpful for debugging. Hence, making the log level configurable in SQLConf would allow users to turn on the plan change log independently and save the trouble of tweaking log4j settings. Meanwhile, filtering plan change log for specific rules can also be very useful.\r\nSo this PR adds two SQL configurations:\r\n1. spark.sql.optimizer.planChangeLog.level - set a specific log level for logging plan changes after a rule is applied.\r\n2. spark.sql.optimizer.planChangeLog.rules - enable plan change logging only for a set of specified rules, separated by commas.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT.\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-12T21:35:39Z","updated_at":"2018-09-13T05:00:23Z","closed_at":"2018-09-13T05:00:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2154c0a7bc1269ec569329d389dbf3842e69cb91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22406/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22406/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22406/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3b98a0f6bbcf6bd56341276f1cdb20e32a743faf","head":{"label":"maryannxue:spark-25415","ref":"spark-25415","sha":"3b98a0f6bbcf6bd56341276f1cdb20e32a743faf","user":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104110775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxMTA3NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"maryannxue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFixes the collision issue with spark executor names in client mode, see SPARK-25295 for the details.\r\nIt follows the cluster name convention as app-name will be used as the prefix and if that is not defined we use \"spark\" as the default prefix. Eg. `spark-pi-1536781360723-exec-1` where spark-pi is the name of the app passed at the config side or transformed if it contains illegal characters.\r\n\r\nAlso fixes the issue with spark app name having spaces in cluster mode.\r\nIf you run the Spark Pi test in client mode it passes.\r\nThe tricky part is the user may set the app name:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3030b82c89d3e45a2e361c469fbc667a1e43b854/examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/SparkPi.scala#L30\r\nIf i do:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-submit \r\n...\r\n --deploy-mode cluster --name \"spark pi\"\r\n...\r\n```\r\nit will fail as the app name is used for the prefix of driver's pod name and it cannot have spaces (according to k8s conventions).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually by running spark job in client mode.\r\nTo reproduce do:\r\n```\r\nkubectl create -f service.yaml\r\nkubectl create -f pod.yaml\r\n```\r\n service.yaml :\r\n```\r\nkind: Service\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: spark-test-app-1-svc\r\nspec:\r\n  clusterIP: None\r\n  selector:\r\n    spark-app-selector:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor self-join/self-union, Spark will produce a physical plan which has multiple `DataSourceV2ScanExec` instances referring to the same `ReadSupport` instance. In this case, the streaming source is indeed scanned multiple times, and the `numInputRows` metrics should be counted for each scan.\r\n\r\nActually we already have 2 test cases to verify the behavior:\r\n1. `StreamingQuerySuite.input row calculation with same V2 source used twice in self-join`\r\n2. `KafkaMicroBatchSourceSuiteBase.ensure stream-stream self-join generates only one offset in log and correct metrics`.\r\n\r\nHowever, in these 2 tests, the expected result is different, which is super confusing. It turns out that, the first test doesn't trigger exchange reuse, so the source is scanned twice. The second test triggers exchange reuse, and the source is scanned only once.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to improve these 2 tests, to test with/without exchange reuse.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\ntest only

regex syntax consistently in Python, which also avoids warnings from pycodestyle about accidentally relying Python's non-escaping of non-reserved chars in normal strings. Also, fix a few long lines.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests, and some manual double-checking of the behavior of regexes in Python 2/3 to be

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe PR takes over #14036 and it introduces a new expression `IntegralDivide` in order to avoid the several unneded cast added previously.\r\n\r\nIn order to prove the performance gain, the following benchmark has been run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  test(\"Benchmark IntegralDivide\") {\r\n    val r = new scala.util.Random(91)\r\n    val nData = 1000000\r\n    val testDataInt = (1 to nData).map(_ => (r.nextInt(), r.nextInt()))\r\n    val testDataLong = (1 to nData).map(_ => (r.nextLong(), r.nextLong()))\r\n    val testDataShort = (1 to nData).map(_ => (r.nextInt().toShort, r.nextInt().toShort))\r\n\r\n    // old code\r\n    val oldExprsInt = testDataInt.map(x =>\r\n      Cast(Divide(Cast(Literal(x._1), DoubleType), Cast(Literal(x._2), DoubleType)), LongType))\r\n    val oldExprsLong = testDataLong.map(x =>\r\n      Cast(Divide(Cast(Literal(x._1), DoubleType), Cast(Literal(x._2), DoubleType)), LongType))\r\n    val oldExprsShort = testDataShort.map(x =>\r\n      Cast(Divide(Cast(Literal(x._1), DoubleType), Cast(Literal(x._2), DoubleType)), LongType))\r\n\r\n    // new code\r\n    val newExprsInt = testDataInt.map(x => IntegralDivide(x._1, x._2))\r\n    val newExprsLong = testDataLong.map(x => IntegralDivide(x._1, x._2))\r\n    val newExprsShort = testDataShort.map(x => IntegralDivide(x._1, x._2))\r\n\r\n\r\n    Seq((\"Long\", \"old\", oldExprsLong),\r\n      (\"Long\", \"new\", newExprsLong),\r\n      (\"Int\", \"old\", oldExprsInt),\r\n      (\"Int\", \"new\", newExprsShort),\r\n      (\"Short\", \"old\", oldExprsShort),\r\n      (\"Short\", \"new\", oldExprsShort)).foreach { case (dt, t, ds) =>\r\n      val start = System.nanoTime()\r\n      ds.foreach(e => e.eval(EmptyRow))\r\n      val endNoCodegen = System.nanoTime()\r\n      println(s\"Running $nData op with $t code on $dt (no-codegen): ${(endNoCodegen - start) / 1000000} ms\")\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe results on my laptop are:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRunning 1000000 op with old code on Long (no-codegen): 600 ms\r\nRunning 1000000 op with new code on Long (no-codegen): 112 ms\r\nRunning 1000000 op with old code on Int (no-codegen): 560 ms\r\nRunning 1000000 op with new code on Int (no-codegen): 135 ms\r\nRunning 1000000 op with old code on Short (no-codegen): 317 ms\r\nRunning 1000000 op with new code on Short (no-codegen): 153 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nShowing a 2-5X improvement. The benchmark doesn't include code generation as it is pretty hard to test the performance there as for such simple operations the most of the time is spent in the code generation/compilation process.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded UTs\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-11T15:57:16Z","updated_at":"2018-12-29T20:30:42Z","closed_at":"2018-09-17T18:37:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f9fc9cc23bf2e57a77d643d05cc26cd9a43d4053","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22395/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22395/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22395/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3550d29f74e437ebc57b846d7b22f0cea254bd18","head":{"label":"mgaido91:SPARK-16323","ref":"SPARK-16323","sha":"3550d29f74e437ebc57b846d7b22f0cea254bd18","user":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94518128,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDUxODEyOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"mgaido91/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91/spark","description":"Mirror

incorrect. The desired configuration settings are not being set when running the test cases.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that defective usage and addresses the test failures that were previously masked by that defect.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added code to relevant test cases to print the expected SQL configuration settings and found that the settings were not being set as expected.

both link back to functions which are deprecated (`registerTempTable` and `createExternalTable`, respectively)\r\n - `sparkR.session` and `dropTempView` do _not_ link back to deprecated functions\r\n\r\nThis PR takes the view that it is preferable _not_ to link back to deprecated functions, and removes these references from `?createOrReplaceTempView` and `?createTable`.\r\n\r\nAs `registerTempTable` was included in the `SparkDataFrame functions` `@family` of functions, other documentation pages which included a link to `?registerTempTable` will similarly be

configuration parameters related to Kubernetes need to be\r\nreset, as they are changed with each invokation of spark-submit and\r\nthus prevents recovery of Spark Streaming tasks.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen using the Kubernetes cluster-manager and spawning a Streaming workload, it is important to reset many spark.kubernetes.* properties that are generated by spark-submit but which would get rewritten when restoring a Checkpoint. This is so, because the spark-submit codepath creates Kubernetes resources, such as a ConfigMap, a Secret and other variables, which have an autogenerated name and the previous one will not resolve anymore.\r\n\r\nIn short, this change enables checkpoint restoration for streaming workloads, and thus enables Spark Streaming workloads in Kubernetes, which were not possible to restore from a checkpoint before if the workload went down.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch needs would benefit from testing in different k8s clusters.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the YARN related code for resetting a Spark Streaming workload, but for the Kubernetes scheduler. This PR removes the initcontainers properties that existed before because they are now removed in master.\r\n\r\nFor a previous discussion, see the non-rebased work at:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-21281 introduced a check for the inputs of `CreateStructLike` to be non-empty. This means that `struct()`, which was previously considered valid, now throws an Exception.  This behavior change was introduced in 2.3.0. The change may break users' application on upgrade and it causes `VectorAssembler` to fail when an empty `inputCols` is defined.\r\n\r\nThe PR removes the added check making `struct()` valid again.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe leftover state from running a continuous processing streaming job should not affect later microbatch execution jobs. If a continuous processing job runs and the same thread gets reused for a microbatch execution job in the same environment, the microbatch job could get wrong answers because it can attempt to load the wrong version of the state.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew and existing unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPrevious Spark versions didn't require Java 8 and an ``Optional`` Spark Java API had to be  implemented to support optional values.\r\n\r\nSince Spark 2.4 uses Java 8, the ``Optional`` Spark Java API should be removed so that Spark uses the original Java API.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n``OptionalSuite`` class was removed to test Spark Java API ``Optional`` class (this class as well).\r\nNotice that the ``get`` method in the Spark Java API ``Optional`` class throws a ``NullPointerException`` when the value is not set whereas the native Java API ``java.util.Optional`` throws a ``NoSuchElementException``.","created_at":"2018-09-10T15:03:26Z","updated_at":"2018-10-25T13:40:25Z","closed_at":"2018-10-25T13:40:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a582a15c4849f01e0a32be3bbbe946488c83c050","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22383/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22383/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22383/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f1882433071ccb9661a5e41d0ff3358d3ea6d5a3","head":{"label":"mmolimar:SPARK-25395","ref":"SPARK-25395","sha":"f1882433071ccb9661a5e41d0ff3358d3ea6d5a3","user":{"login":"mmolimar","id":901653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTY1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/901653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar","html_url":"https://github.com/mmolimar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95629947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTYyOTk0Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"mmolimar/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mmolimar","id":901653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTY1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/901653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar","html_url":"https://github.com/mmolimar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmolimar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mmolimar/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBack port of #22354 and #17955 to 2.2 (#22354 depends on methods introduced by #17955).\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nAn alternative fix for #21698\r\n\r\nWhen Spark rerun tasks for an RDD, there are 3 different behaviors:\r\n1. determinate. Always return the same result with same order when rerun.\r\n2. unordered. Returns same data set in random order when rerun.\r\n3. indeterminate. Returns different result when rerun.\r\n\r\nNormally Spark doesn't need to care about it. Spark runs stages one by one, when a task is failed, just rerun it. Although the rerun task may return a different result, users will not be surprised.\r\n\r\nHowever, Spark may rerun a finished stage when seeing fetch failures. When this happens, Spark needs to rerun all the tasks of all the succeeding stages if the RDD output is indeterminate, because the input of the succeeding stages has been changed.\r\n\r\nIf the RDD output is determinate, we only need to rerun the failed tasks of the succeeding stages, because the input doesn't change.\r\n\r\nIf the RDD output is unordered, it's same as determinate, because shuffle partitioner is always deterministic(round-robin partitioner is not a shuffle partitioner that extends `org.apache.spark.Partitioner`), so the reducers will still get the same input data set.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixed the failure handling for `repartition`, to avoid correctness issues.\r\n\r\nFor `repartition`, it applies a stateful map function to generate a round-robin id, which is order sensitive and makes the RDD's output indeterminate. When the stage contains `repartition` reruns, we must also rerun all the tasks of all the succeeding stages.\r\n\r\n**future improvement:**\r\n1. Currently we can't rollback and rerun a shuffle map stage, and just fail. We should fix it later. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25341\r\n2. Currently we can't rollback and rerun a result stage, and just fail. We should fix it later. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25342\r\n3. We should provide public API to allow users to tag the random level of the RDD's computing function.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\na new test case\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-10T14:22:22Z","updated_at":"2018-12-30T17:25:22Z","closed_at":"2018-09-11T14:32:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2ab6e4df310805d813ee6ed7393428c257adecec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22382/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22382/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22382/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/efd58ed96c1a8caeb2fa8da8d3300703ead047f6","head":{"label":"bersprockets:SPARK-23243-2.2","ref":"SPARK-23243-2.2","sha":"efd58ed96c1a8caeb2fa8da8d3300703ead047f6","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Exposes several metrics regarding application status as a source, useful to scrape them via jmx instead of mining the metrics rest api.  Example use case: prometheus + jmx exporter.\r\n- Metrics are gathered when a job ends at the AppStatusListener side, could be more fine-grained but most metrics like tasks completed are also counted by executors. More metrics could be exposed in the future to avoid scraping executors in some scenarios.\r\n- a config option `spark.app.status.metrics.enabled` is added to disable/enable these metrics, by default

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR can correctly cause assertion failure when incorrect nullable of DataType in the result is generated by a target function to be tested.\r\n\r\nLet us think the following example. In the future, a developer would write incorrect code that returns unexpected result. We have to correctly cause fail in this test since `valueContainsNull=false` while `expr` includes `null`. However, without this PR, this test passes. This PR can correctly cause fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest(\"test TARGETFUNCTON\") {\r\n  val expr = TARGETMAPFUNCTON()\r\n  // expr = UnsafeMap(3 -> 6, 7 -> null)\r\n  // expr.dataType = (IntegerType, IntegerType, false)\r\n\r\n  expected = Map(3 -> 6, 7 -> null)\r\n  checkEvaluation(expr, expected)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn [`checkEvaluationWithUnsafeProjection`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/ExpressionEvalHelper.scala#L208-L235), the results are compared using `UnsafeRow`. When the given `expected` is [converted](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/ExpressionEvalHelper.scala#L226-L227)) to `UnsafeRow` using the `DataType` of `expr`.\r\n```\r\nval expectedRow = UnsafeProjection.create(Array(expression.dataType, expression.dataType)).apply(lit)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn summary, `expr` is `[0,1800000038,5000000038,18,2,0,700000003,2,0,6,18,2,0,700000003,2,0,6]` with and w/o this PR. `expected` is converted to\r\n\r\n* w/o  this PR, `[0,1800000038,5000000038,18,2,0,700000003,2,0,6,18,2,0,700000003,2,0,6]`\r\n* with this PR, `[0,1800000038,5000000038,18,2,0,700000003,2,2,6,18,2,0,700000003,2,2,6]`\r\n\r\nAs a result, w/o this PR, the test unexpectedly passes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is because, w/o this PR, based on given `dataType`, generated code of projection for `expected` avoids to set nullbit.\r\n```\r\n                    // tmpInput_2 is expected\r\n/* 155 */           for (int index_1 = 0; index_1 < numElements_1; index_1++) {\r\n/* 156 */             mutableStateArray_1[1].write(index_1, tmpInput_2.getInt(index_1));\r\n/* 157 */           }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this PR, generated code of projection for `expected` always checks whether nullbit should be set by `isNullAt`\r\n```\r\n                    // tmpInput_2 is expected\r\n/* 161 */           for (int index_1 = 0; index_1 < numElements_1; index_1++) {\r\n/* 162 */\r\n/* 163 */             if (tmpInput_2.isNullAt(index_1)) {\r\n/* 164 */               mutableStateArray_1[1].setNull4Bytes(index_1);\r\n/* 165 */             } else {\r\n/* 166 */               mutableStateArray_1[1].write(index_1, tmpInput_2.getInt(index_1));\r\n/* 167 */             }\r\n/* 168 */\r\n/* 169 */           }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe PR fixes NPE in `UnivocityParser` caused by malformed CSV input. In some cases, `uniVocity` parser can return `null` for bad input. In the PR, I propose to check result of parsing and not propagate NPE to upper layers.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added a test which reproduce the issue and tested by `CSVSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-09T15:51:12Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:33:20Z","closed_at":"2018-09-13T01:55:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b6334f0c60d2a32882ec5b6796669b595c5c2fd1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22374/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22374/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22374/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2a0dac46f114326f58a1cf2422d351458e00c256","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:npe-on-bad-csv","ref":"npe-on-bad-csv","sha":"2a0dac46f114326f58a1cf2422d351458e00c256","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-21281 introduced a check for the inputs of `CreateStructLike` to be non-empty. This means that `struct()`, which was previously considered valid, now throws an Exception.  This behavior change was introduced in 2.3.0. The change may break users' application on upgrade and it causes `VectorAssembler` to fail when an empty `inputCols` is defined.\r\n\r\nThe PR removes the added check making `struct()` valid again.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add an overloaded method for `sampleBy` which accepts the first argument of the `Column` type. This will allow to sample by any complex columns as well as sampling by multiple columns. For example:\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\nspark.createDataFrame(Seq((\"Bob\", 17), (\"Alice\", 10), (\"Nico\", 8), (\"Bob\", 17),\r\n  (\"Alice\", 10))).toDF(\"name\", \"age\")\r\n  .stat\r\n  .sampleBy(struct($\"name\", $\"age\"), Map(Row(\"Alice\", 10) -> 0.3, Row(\"Nico\", 8) -> 1.0), 36L)\r\n  .show()\r\n\r\n+-----+---+\r\n| name|age|\r\n+-----+---+\r\n| Nico|  8|\r\n|Alice|

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR contains 3 optimizations:\r\n 1)  it improves significantly the operation `--` on `AttributeSet`. As a benchmark for the `--` operation, the following code has been run\r\n```\r\ntest(\"AttributeSet -- benchmark\") {\r\n    val attrSetA = AttributeSet((1 to 100).map { i => AttributeReference(s\"c$i\", IntegerType)() })\r\n    val attrSetB = AttributeSet(attrSetA.take(80).toSeq)\r\n    val attrSetC = AttributeSet((1 to 100).map { i => AttributeReference(s\"c2_$i\", IntegerType)() })\r\n    val attrSetD = AttributeSet((attrSetA.take(50) ++ attrSetC.take(50)).toSeq)\r\n    val attrSetE = AttributeSet((attrSetC.take(50) ++ attrSetA.take(50)).toSeq)\r\n    val n_iter = 1000000\r\n    val t0 = System.nanoTime()\r\n    (1 to n_iter) foreach { _ =>\r\n      val r1 = attrSetA -- attrSetB\r\n      val r2 = attrSetA -- attrSetC\r\n      val r3 = attrSetA -- attrSetD\r\n      val r4 = attrSetA -- attrSetE\r\n    }\r\n    val t1 = System.nanoTime()\r\n    val totalTime = t1 - t0\r\n    println(s\"Average time: ${totalTime / n_iter} us\")\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThe results are:\r\n```\r\nBefore PR - Average time: 67674 us (100  %)\r\nAfter PR -  Average time: 28827 us (42.6 %)\r\n```\r\n2) In `ColumnPruning`, it replaces the occurrences of `(attributeSet1 -- attributeSet2).nonEmpty` with `attributeSet1.subsetOf(attributeSet2)` which is order of magnitudes more efficient (especially where there are many attributes). Running the previous benchmark replacing `--` with `subsetOf` returns:\r\n```\r\nAverage time: 67 us (0.1 %)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3) Provides a more efficient way of building `AttributeSet`s, which can greatly improve the performance of the methods `references` and `outputSet` of `Expression` and `QueryPlan`. This basically avoids unneeded operations (eg. creating many `AttributeEqual` wrapper classes which could be avoided)\r\n\r\nThe overall effect of those optimizations has been tested on `ColumnPruning` with the following benchmark:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest(\"ColumnPruning benchmark\") {\r\n    val attrSetA = (1 to 100).map { i => AttributeReference(s\"c$i\", IntegerType)() }\r\n    val attrSetB = attrSetA.take(80)\r\n    val attrSetC = attrSetA.take(20).map(a => Alias(Add(a, Literal(1)), s\"${a.name}_1\")())\r\n\r\n    val input = LocalRelation(attrSetA)\r\n    val query1 = Project(attrSetB, Project(attrSetA, input)).analyze\r\n    val query2 = Project(attrSetC, Project(attrSetA, input)).analyze\r\n    val query3 = Project(attrSetA, Project(attrSetA, input)).analyze\r\n    val nIter = 100000\r\n    val t0 = System.nanoTime()\r\n    (1 to nIter).foreach { _ =>\r\n      ColumnPruning(query1)\r\n      ColumnPruning(query2)\r\n      ColumnPruning(query3)\r\n    }\r\n    val t1 = System.nanoTime()\r\n    val totalTime = t1 - t0\r\n    println(s\"Average time: ${totalTime / nIter} us\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output of the test is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBefore PR - Average time: 733471 us (100  %)\r\nAfter PR  - Average time: 362455 us (49.4 %)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe performance improvement has been evaluated also on the `SQLQueryTestSuite`'s queries:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(before) org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.ColumnPruning                                              518413198 / 1377707172                          2756 / 15717                                   \r\n(after)  org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.ColumnPruning                                              415432579 / 1121147950                          2756 / 15717                                   \r\n% Running time                                                                                                  80.1% / 81.3%\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso other rules benefit especially from (3), despite the impact is lower, eg:\r\n```\r\n(before) org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.Analyzer$ResolveReferences                                  307341442 / 623436806                           2154 / 16480                                   \r\n(after)  org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.Analyzer$ResolveReferences                                  290511312 / 560962495                           2154 / 16480                                   \r\n% Running time                                                                                                  94.5% / 90.0%\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason why the impact on the `SQLQueryTestSuite`'s queries is lower compared to the other benchmark is that the optimizations are more significant when the number of attributes involved is higher. Since in the tests we often have very few attributes, the effect there is lower.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nrun benchmarks + existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen running TPC-DS benchmarks on 2.4 release, @npoggi and @winglungngai  saw more than 10% performance regression on the following queries:

After we applying the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22338, the performance regression still exists. If we revert the changes in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19222, @npoggi and @winglungngai  found the performance regression was resolved.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nSchema pruning doesn't work if nested column is used in where clause.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n```\r\nsql(\"select name.first from contacts where name.first = 'David'\")\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Project [name#19.first AS first#40]\r\n+- *(1) Filter (isnotnull(name#19) && (name#19.first = David))\r\n   +- *(1) FileScan parquet [name#19] Batched: false, Format: Parquet, PartitionFilters: [], \r\n    PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(name)], ReadSchema: struct<name:struct<first:string,middle:string,last:string>>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn above query plan, the scan node reads the entire schema of `name` column.\r\n\r\nThis issue is reported by:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21320#issuecomment-419290197\r\n\r\nThe cause is that we infer a root field from expression `IsNotNull(name)`. However, for such expression, we don't really use the nested fields of this root field, so we can ignore the unnecessary nested fields.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2018-09-07T05:39:09Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:35:41Z","closed_at":"2018-09-12T17:48:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"19c0d00f8e12cbecde535786946a043452be2f23","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22357/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22357/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22357/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/03bf5406f990db21a980a3c1d86cf962e5e51258","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-25363","ref":"SPARK-25363","sha":"03bf5406f990db21a980a3c1d86cf962e5e51258","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

`CodeGeneratorWithInterpretedFallbackSuite`.","created_at":"2018-09-06T14:57:11Z","updated_at":"2018-09-19T12:03:53Z","closed_at":"2018-09-19T11:59:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"71f777cbe8a03b1836e5669ed1d635643a15f344","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22355/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22355/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22355/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/87491732e1473880077daf9ce5c080845f4742e1","head":{"label":"maropu:SPARK-25358","ref":"SPARK-25358","sha":"87491732e1473880077daf9ce5c080845f4742e1","user":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27115199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNTE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"maropu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maropu/spark","description":"Mirror

https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22112 to 2.3\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nAn alternative fix for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21698\r\n\r\nWhen Spark rerun tasks for an RDD, there are 3 different behaviors:\r\n1. determinate. Always return the same result with same order when rerun.\r\n2. unordered. Returns same data set in random order when rerun.\r\n3. indeterminate. Returns different result when rerun.\r\n\r\nNormally Spark doesn't need to care about it. Spark runs stages one by one, when a task is failed, just rerun it. Although the rerun task may return a different result, users will not be surprised.\r\n\r\nHowever, Spark may rerun a finished stage when seeing fetch failures. When this happens, Spark needs to rerun all the tasks of all the succeeding stages if the RDD output is indeterminate, because the input of the succeeding stages has been changed.\r\n\r\nIf the RDD output is determinate, we only need to rerun the failed tasks of the succeeding stages, because the input doesn't change.\r\n\r\nIf the RDD output is unordered, it's same as determinate, because shuffle partitioner is always deterministic(round-robin partitioner is not a shuffle partitioner that extends `org.apache.spark.Partitioner`), so the reducers will still get the same input data set.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixed the failure handling for `repartition`, to avoid correctness issues.\r\n\r\nFor `repartition`, it applies a stateful map function to generate a round-robin id, which is order sensitive and makes the RDD's output indeterminate. When the stage contains `repartition` reruns, we must also rerun all the tasks of all the succeeding stages.\r\n\r\n**future improvement:**\r\n1. Currently we can't rollback and rerun a shuffle map stage, and just fail. We should fix it later. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25341\r\n2. Currently we can't rollback and rerun a result stage, and just fail. We should fix it later. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25342\r\n3. We should provide public API to allow users to tag the random level of the RDD's computing function.\r\n\r\na new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nField metadata removed from SparkPlanInfo in #18600 . Corresponding, many meta data was also removed from event SparkListenerSQLExecutionStart in Spark event log. If we want to analyze event log to get all input paths, we couldn't get them. Instead, simpleString of SparkPlanInfo JSON only display 100 characters, it won't help.\r\n\r\nBefore 2.3, the fragment of SparkListenerSQLExecutionStart in event log looks like below (It contains the metadata field which has the intact information):\r\n>{\"Event\":\"org.apache.spark.sql.execution.ui.SparkListenerSQLExecutionStart\", Location: InMemoryFileIndex[hdfs://cluster1/sys/edw/test1/test2/test3/test4..., \"metadata\": {\"Location\": \"InMemoryFileIndex[hdfs://cluster1/sys/edw/test1/test2/test3/test4/test5/snapshot/dt=20180904]\",\"ReadSchema\":\"struct<snpsht_start_dt:date,snpsht_end_dt:date,am_ntlogin_name:string,am_first_name:string,am_last_name:string,isg_name:string,CRE_DATE:date,CRE_USER:string,UPD_DATE:timestamp,UPD_USER:string>\"}\r\n\r\nAfter #18600, metadata field was removed.\r\n>{\"Event\":\"org.apache.spark.sql.execution.ui.SparkListenerSQLExecutionStart\", Location: InMemoryFileIndex[hdfs://cluster1/sys/edw/test1/test2/test3/test4...,\r\n\r\nSo I add this field back to SparkPlanInfo class. Then it will log out the meta data to event log. Intact information in event log is very useful for offline job analysis.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis took me a while to debug and find out. Looks we better at least leave a debug log that SQL text for a view will be used.\r\n\r\nHere's how I got there:\r\n\r\n**Hive:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE emp AS SELECT 'user' AS name, 'address' as address;\r\nCREATE DATABASE d100;\r\nCREATE FUNCTION d100.udf100 AS 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.udf.generic.GenericUDFUpper';\r\nCREATE VIEW testview AS SELECT d100.udf100(name) FROM default.emp;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Spark:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nsql(\"SELECT * FROM testview\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT * FROM testview\").show()\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Undefined function: 'd100.udf100'. This function is neither a registered temporary function nor a permanent function registered in the database 'default'.; line 1 pos 7\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, it actually makes sense since the view is defined as `SELECT d100.udf100(name) FROM default.emp;` and Hive API:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Table.getViewExpandedText()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis returns a wrongly qualified SQL string for the view as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT `d100.udf100`(`emp`.`name`) FROM `default`.`emp`\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich works fine in Hive but not in Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually:\r\n\r\n```\r\n18/09/06 19:32:48 DEBUG HiveSessionCatalog: 'SELECT `d100.udf100`(`emp`.`name`) FROM `default`.`emp`' will be used for the view(testview).\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-06T11:33:13Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T12:43:13Z","closed_at":"2018-09-08T05:00:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f79ff1a5abe6f1c6dacaa1185d1d9c465600447d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22351/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22351/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22351/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/207d8dfb240ce8e283716e66bb62e7330a69fa8f","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:minor-debug","ref":"minor-debug","sha":"207d8dfb240ce8e283716e66bb62e7330a69fa8f","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nthis PR do following in VectorizedParquetRecordReader class:\r\n\r\n1. In `nextKeyValue()`, remove calling to `resultBatch()`. Columnar batch initializition by `initBatch()` is moved to `nextBatch()`.\r\n\r\n2. In `nextBatch()`, put `if (rowsReturned >= totalRowCount) return false;` before columnVectors resetting. When condition is true, columnVectors resetting need not execute. \r\n\r\n3. In `nextBatch()`, call checkEndOfRowGroup only when `rowsReturned == totalCountLoadedSoFar` is true instead of calling every time.\r\n\r\n4. In `checkEndOfRowGroup()`, save columns of requestedSchema for next use instead of reading every time. \r\n\r\nFrom analysis of JMC tool, we found that frequencies of calling to `nextKeyValue()` is very high, performance gain may be got from these changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. Existing Unit Tests\r\n2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn some cases, executeTake in SparkPlan could decode more than necessary.\r\n\r\nFor example, in case of below odd/even number partitioning, total row's count from partitions will be 100, although it is limited with 51. And 'executeTake' in SparkPlan decodes all of them, \"49\" rows of which are unnecessarily decoded.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sparkContext.parallelize((0 until 100).map(i => (i, 1))).toDF()\r\n      .repartitionByRange(2, $\"_1\" % 2).limit(51).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy using a iterator of the scalar collection, we can make ensure that at most n rows are decoded.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests that call limit function of DataFrame.\r\n\r\ntestOnly *SQLQuerySuite\r\ntestOnly

https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22320 to branch-2.3\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLet's see the follow example:\r\n```\r\n        val location = \"/tmp/t\"\r\n        val df = spark.range(10).toDF(\"id\")\r\n        df.write.format(\"parquet\").saveAsTable(\"tbl\")\r\n        spark.sql(\"CREATE VIEW view1 AS SELECT id FROM tbl\")\r\n        spark.sql(s\"CREATE TABLE tbl2(ID long) USING parquet location $location\")\r\n        spark.sql(\"INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE tbl2 SELECT ID FROM view1\")\r\n        println(spark.read.parquet(location).schema)\r\n        spark.table(\"tbl2\").show()\r\n```\r\nThe output column name in schema will be `id` instead of `ID`, thus the last query shows nothing from `tbl2`.\r\nBy enabling the debug message we can see that the output naming is changed from `ID` to `id`, and then the `outputColumns` in `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand` is changed in `RemoveRedundantAliases`.\r\n![wechatimg5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/44947871-6299f200-ae46-11e8-9c96-d45fe368206c.jpeg)\r\n\r\n![wechatimg4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/44947866-56ae3000-ae46-11e8-8923-8b3bbe060075.jpeg)\r\n\r\n**To guarantee correctness**, we should change the output columns from `Seq[Attribute]` to `Seq[String]` to avoid its names being replaced by optimizer.\r\n\r\nI will fix project elimination related rules in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22311 after this one.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-06T06:42:23Z","updated_at":"2018-09-07T07:31:30Z","closed_at":"2018-09-07T07:31:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"09d4c3d454548b59f5253c51c126c898e62dfa04","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22346/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22346/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22346/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/470efdc2924553f941165f5fe84d930a5265081c","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:portSchemaOutputName2.3","ref":"portSchemaOutputName2.3","sha":"470efdc2924553f941165f5fe84d930a5265081c","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nparquet data source tables and hive parquet tables have different behaviors about parquet field resolution. So, when `spark.sql.hive.convertMetastoreParquet` is true, users might face inconsistent behaviors. The differences are:\r\n* Whether respect spark.sql.caseSensitive. Without #22148, both data source tables and hive tables do NOT respect spark.sql.caseSensitive. However data source tables always do case-sensitive parquet field resolution, while hive tables always do case-insensitive parquet field resolution no matter whether spark.sql.caseSensitive is set to true or false. #22148 let data source tables respect spark.sql.caseSensitive while hive serde table behavior is not changed.\r\n* How to resolve ambiguity in case-insensitive mode. Without #22148, data source tables do case-sensitive resolution and return columns with the corresponding letter cases, while hive tables always return the first matched column ignoring cases. #22148 let data source tables throw exception when there is ambiguity while hive table behavior is not changed.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make behaviors consistent when converting hive table to data source table.\r\n* The behavior must be consistent to do the conversion, so we skip the conversion in case-sensitive mode because hive parquet table always do case-insensitive field resolution.\r\n* In case-insensitive mode, when converting hive parquet table to parquet data source, we switch the duplicated fields resolution mode to ask parquet data source to pick the first matched field - the same behavior as hive parquet table - to keep behaviors consistent.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe will update block info coming from executors, at the timing like caching a RDD. However, when removing RDDs with unpersisting, we don't ask to update block info. So the block info is not updated.\r\n\r\nWe can fix this with few options:\r\n\r\n1. Ask to update block info when unpersisting\r\n\r\nThis is simplest but changes driver-executor communication a bit.\r\n\r\n2. Update block info when processing the event of unpersisting RDD\r\n\r\nWe send a `SparkListenerUnpersistRDD` event when unpersisting RDD. When processing this event, we can update block info of the RDD. This only changes event processing code so the risk seems to be lower.\r\n\r\nCurrently this patch takes option 2 for lower risk. If we agree first option has no risk, we can change to it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-05T10:10:55Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:35:41Z","closed_at":"2018-09-11T17:35:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d90f1ddfa4721a25333a3148e05852795e1ce5a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22341/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22341/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22341/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7c76790c9fab6d695aa45f7efbba766660c0e2a8","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-24889","ref":"SPARK-24889","sha":"7c76790c9fab6d695aa45f7efbba766660c0e2a8","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal work by Steve Loughran.\r\nBased on #17745. \r\n\r\nThis is a minimal patch of changes to FileInputDStream to reduce File status requests when querying files. Each call to file status is 3+ http calls to object store.

When we unpersist rdd or UNCACHE TABLE，the storage memory size in Executor tab could not be reduced. So I modify code as follow:\r\n1，BlockManager send block status to BlockManagerMaster after it removed the block\r\n2，AppStatusListener receive block remove status and modify LiveRDD and LiveExecutor info, so the storage memory size and rdd blocks in Executor Tab could change when we unpersist rdd. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\ncache table and then unpersist table.

tab.\r\n![storage-tab-before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42287875/45072023-b721c380-b10b-11e8-9e03-1b87e899ec6f.png)\r\n![executor-tab-before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42287875/45072024-b7ba5a00-b10b-11e8-83da-b959f498ea10.png)\r\n![storage-tab-after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42287875/45072025-b7ba5a00-b10b-11e8-80ee-0b62969c0d17.png)\r\n![executor-tab-after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42287875/45072027-b852f080-b10b-11e8-9b0f-3a6ad551492b.png)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-05T05:10:27Z","updated_at":"2018-09-08T10:24:32Z","closed_at":"2018-09-08T10:24:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b0cdabce3d702d2dfe8401de55636c53edf3e269","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22335/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22335/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22335/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5955fa6c6daa3d345046fc1e1fdc6e7eb73cd5e2","head":{"label":"cfangplus:master","ref":"master","sha":"5955fa6c6daa3d345046fc1e1fdc6e7eb73cd5e2","user":{"login":"cfangplus","id":42287875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMjg3ODc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42287875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfangplus","html_url":"https://github.com/cfangplus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfangplus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfangplus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfangplus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfangplus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfangplus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfangplus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfangplus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfangplus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfangplus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ca861fea21adc4e6ec95eced7076cb27fc86ea18","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we add new columns in a Dataset, they are added automatically at the end of the Dataset.\r\nGenerally users want to add new columns either at the end, in the beginning or in a defined position, depends on use cases.\r\nIn my case for example, we add technical columns in the beginning of a Dataset and we add business columns at the end.\r\n\r\nThis pull request, add the ability to add new columns in a user-defined position of a Dataset, using an optional parameter **atPosition** that should start from 0: \r\n- negative value (default behavior) means add the column at the end\r\n- a position greater than the columns number means add the column at the end\r\n\r\nThis change is backward compatible with old versions.\r\n\r\nConsider this data frame with two columns:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval df = sc.parallelize(Seq(1, 2, 3)).toDF.withColumn(\"newCol1\", col(\"value\") + 1)\r\ndf.printSchema\r\n\r\nroot\r\n |-- value: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- newCol1: integer (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we can:\r\n\r\n1- add a new column without using the parameter **atPosition** (default behavior):\r\n\r\n```\r\nval newDf = df.withColumn(\"newCol2\", col(\"value\") + 2)\r\nnewDf.printSchema\r\n\r\nroot\r\n |-- value: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- newCol1: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- newCol2: integer (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2- add a new column using the parameter **atPosition** with different values:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval newDf = df.withColumn(\"newColumn\", col(\"value\") + 2, 2)\r\nnewDf.printSchema\r\n\r\nroot\r\n |-- value: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- newCol1: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- newCol2: integer (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nval newDf = df.withColumn(\"newColumn\", col(\"value\") + 2, 0)\r\nnewDf.printSchema\r\n\r\nroot\r\n |-- newCol2: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- value: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- newCol1: integer (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nval newDf = df.withColumn(\"newColumn\", col(\"value\") + 2, 1)\r\nnewDf.printSchema\r\n\r\nroot\r\n |-- value: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- newCol2: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- newCol1: integer (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n=> with negative position\r\n\r\n```\r\nval newDf = df.withColumn(\"newColumn\", col(\"value\") + 2, -2)\r\nnewDf.printSchema\r\n\r\nroot\r\n |-- value: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- newCol1: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- newCol2: integer (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n=>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nReproduce File Sink duplication in driver failure scenario to help understanding the situation.\r\nPropose a new StagingFileCommitProtocol that creates the target files in a `staging` subdirectory and upon job commit it moves all the files to the target directory. The target file names of a task will be the same in 2 different runs. This way a potential source for duplication (when same content is placed into 2 files with different names) is eliminated.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nCreated specific unit test for the new protocol: StagingFileCommitProtocolSuite\r\nRan the test that reproduced the problem: FileStreamSinkUnitSuite\r\nMade FileStreamStressSuite more strict to demand exactly once delivery.\r\nTested on a 4 machine cluster sending 30000 messages 20 times killing the driver. Each message was delivered exactly once.\r\nRan tests for sql with sbt.","created_at":"2018-09-04T14:25:25Z","updated_at":"2019-02-19T06:27:42Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T15:59:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"809898be040da37c8511cac21810d14577e5d230","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22331/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22331/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22331/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/92247a307967125e0baa9f5780550afc5151543d","head":{"label":"misutoth:file-sink-dupe","ref":"file-sink-dupe","sha":"92247a307967125e0baa9f5780550afc5151543d","user":{"login":"misutoth","id":7244068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNDQwNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7244068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth","html_url":"https://github.com/misutoth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119835914,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTk4MzU5MTQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"misutoth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"misutoth","id":7244068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNDQwNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7244068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth","html_url":"https://github.com/misutoth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misutoth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/misutoth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImplement an image schema datasource.\r\n\r\nThis image datasource support:\r\n  - partition discovery (loading partitioned images)\r\n  - dropImageFailures (the same behavior with `ImageSchema.readImage`)\r\n  - path wildcard matching (the same behavior with `ImageSchema.readImage`)\r\n  - loading recursively from directory (different from `ImageSchema.readImage`, but use such path: `/path/to/dir/**`)\r\n\r\nThis datasource **NOT** support:\r\n  - specify `numPartitions` (it will be determined by datasource automatically)\r\n  - sampling (you can use `df.sample` later but the sampling operator won't be pushdown to datasource)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n## Benchmark\r\nI benchmark and compare the cost time between old `ImageSchema.read` API and my image datasource.\r\n\r\n**cluster**: 4 nodes, each with 64GB memory, 8 cores CPU\r\n**test dataset**: Flickr8k_Dataset (about 8091 images)\r\n\r\n**time cost**:\r\n- My image datasource time (automatically generate 258 partitions):  38.04s \r\n- `ImageSchema.read` time (set 16 partitions): 68.4s\r\n- `ImageSchema.read` time (set 258 partitions):  90.6s\r\n\r\n**time cost when increase image number by double (clone Flickr8k_Dataset and loads double number images)**:\r\n- My image datasource time (automatically generate 515 partitions):  95.4s \r\n- `ImageSchema.read` (set 32 partitions): 109s\r\n- `ImageSchema.read` (set 515 partitions):  105s\r\n\r\nSo we can see that my image datasource implementation (this PR) bring some performance improvement compared against old`ImageSchema.read` API.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-04T10:02:56Z","updated_at":"2018-09-06T01:40:37Z","closed_at":"2018-09-05T19:03:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5421f1ff9a0a53134ebca15cdb4e962d6a807174","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22328/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22328/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22328/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/218ce4cf796308c8705a27889b25100e2b779365","head":{"label":"WeichenXu123:image_datasource","ref":"image_datasource","sha":"218ce4cf796308c8705a27889b25100e2b779365","user":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58255485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODI1NTQ4NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"WeichenXu123/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123/spark","description":"Mirror
