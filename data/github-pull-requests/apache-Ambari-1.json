apologies for pushing the commit directly without having a PR, it was accidentally done due to a missed check for push to a right branch instead got pushed to the tracking branch. Will take care about this in future contributions.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIssue: User authentication fails for previously sync'd LDAP / AD based users.\r\n\r\nCause: the authentication-key was being split before checking if the authentication type required is local or remote based, hence it fails with a NullPointerException.\r\n\r\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix)\r\nChanges made: Updated the implementation to add a check for auth type before adding split for authentication-key\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nvalidated changes on a local cluster with AD setup\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. Ex: unit tests, manual tests)\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screen-shot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nPlease review [Ambari Contributing

PR updates the supported encryption types in the Kerberos configuration to enhance security and align with modern encryption standards. The current configuration includes outdated and less secure encryption types, which are replaced with stronger and more widely supported encryption algorithms.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n- Modified the `kerberos-env.xml` file in the `ambari/ambari-server/src/main/resources/stacks/BIGTOP/3.2.0/services/KERBEROS/configuration/` directory.\r\n- Replaced the existing encryption types:\r\n  ```xml\r\n  <value>aes des3-cbc-sha1 rc4 des-cbc-md5</value>\r\n  ```\r\n  with:\r\n  ```xml\r\n  <value>aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96</value>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n**Reason for Change:**\r\n- The previous encryption types (`des3-cbc-sha1`, `rc4`, and `des-cbc-md5`) are considered weak and vulnerable to attacks.\r\n- The new encryption types (`aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96` and `aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96`) are more secure and widely supported in modern Kerberos implementations.\r\n\r\n**Impact:**\r\n- This change ensures that only strong encryption types are used for Kerberos session keys, improving overall security.\r\n- Systems relying on older encryption types may need to update their Kerberos configurations to remain

PR addresses an issue with the HDFS web service check. Currently, the check does not consider the HTTP 302 status code as a valid response, even though it is a valid and usable status for the service. This change adds a condition to include the 302 status code as an acceptable response, ensuring the service check works correctly in scenarios where a 302 redirect is returned.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\nModified the HDFS web service check logic to include a check for the 302 status code.\r\n\r\nUpdated the relevant test cases to verify the new behavior.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n\r\nManually tested the service check with a 302 response to ensure it is recognized as

PR introduces compatibility for Oceanbase within Apache Ambari, with adjustments made to the MySQL DDL script to ensure proper functioning when working with Oceanbase, which supports the MySQL protocol.\r\n\r\n1. **Oceanbase Overview**:  \r\n   Oceanbase is a distributed relational database developed by AntGroup , designed to be highly scalable and provide high availability. It is fully compatible with the MySQL protocol, allowing it to be used as a drop-in replacement for MySQL in many cases, which makes it suitable for large-scale applications and enterprise environments.\r\n\r\n2. **DDL Modifications**:  \r\n   The file `/var/lib/ambari-server/resources/Ambari-DDL-MySQL-CREATE.sql` was modified to adjust the field lengths of `service_name` and `view_name`. These adjustments help avoid errors when importing the DDL into Oceanbase, aligning the field sizes properly.\r\n\r\n![Image of modified SQL](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5c0d0c7-e693-4482-a9ab-da17f22edb23)\r\n\r\n3. **Testing**:  \r\n   We have thoroughly tested the modified SQL on both Oceanbase and MySQL databases. After applying the changes, the DDL was successfully imported into both databases, and the Ambari services started without issues.\r\n\r\n   ![Image showing successful import and service start](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f1d2d8c-0d02-4b49-b2f4-e3b2424767a5)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3cc7d78-a46f-435b-b477-1e1c6610430b)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. **Known Issue**:  \r\n   A minor error occurs during the import process of the SQL into Oceanbase at line 36. This error is due to MySQL-specific syntax, but it does not impact functionality, as the syntax does not affect the overall operation of the system.\r\n\r\n  ![Image showing error in line 36](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/264176e9-b02b-495b-9fa3-dd39449dd945)\r\n ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ab8de2b-f911-4b73-b1d8-2ebb1da9b545)\r\n\r\n5. **Final Validation**:  \r\n   After making the changes, we successfully started Ambari, installed, and ran all components without any issues. This confirms that the changes ensure full compatibility with both Oceanbase and MySQL, allowing Ambari to function

global flags. The problem is that in Python 11, the regex flag (?u) must be placed at the beginning of the regular expression pattern, not in the middle or end.\r\nFile Location:\r\n[ambari-common](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-common)/src/main/python/ambari_jinja2/ambari_jinja2/filters.py\r\nSolution:\r\nChange the regular expression pattern from:\r\n_word_re = re.compile(r\"\\w+(?u)\")\r\nto:\r\n_word_re = re.compile(r\"(?u)\\w+\")\r\nExplanation:\r\n● The (?u) flag enables Unicode matching\r\n● In Python 11, all flags must be specified at the start of the regular expression pattern\r\n● This issue only appears in Python 11; earlier Python versions work fine with flags in any position\r\n● Moving the (?u) flag to the beginning of the pattern resolves the error while maintaining the same

Message:\r\nre.error: global flags not at the start of the expression at position

global flags. The problem is that in Python 11, the regex flag (?u) must be placed at the beginning of the regular expression pattern, not in the middle or end.\r\nFile Location:\r\nambari-common/src/main/python/ambari_jinja2/ambari_jinja2/filters.py\r\nSolution:\r\nChange the regular expression pattern from:\r\n`_word_re = re.compile(r\"\\w+(?u)\")`\r\nto:\r\n`_word_re = re.compile(r\"(?u)\\w+\")`\r\nExplanation:\r\n● The (?u) flag enables Unicode matching\r\n● In Python 11, all flags must be specified at the start of the regular expression pattern\r\n● This issue only appears in Python 11; earlier Python versions work fine with flags in any position\r\n● Moving the (?u) flag to the beginning of the pattern resolves the error while maintaining the same

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImprove View Loading Mechanism in Ambari\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of the getViewConfigFromArchive method in ViewArchiveUtility.java is not robust enough when loading views via the SPI mechanism in Ambari. The purpose of this method is to retrieve views from a specified JAR file and instantiate a ViewConfig object containing the view metadata.\r\n\r\nProblem Description\r\nThe method currently uses the following code to load the view configuration:\r\n\r\n```JAVA\r\nClassLoader cl = URLClassLoader.newInstance(new URL[]{archiveFile.toURI().toURL()});\r\nInputStream configStream = cl.getResourceAsStream(VIEW_XML);\r\n```\r\nIn normal scenarios, all views are stored in /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/views, and this works as expected. However, when ambari-admin-3.0.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar or any other view JAR file exists in the /usr/lib/ambari-server/ directory, the call to cl.getResourceAsStream(VIEW_XML); will always return the first view loaded from /usr/lib/ambari-server/, rather than the intended views.xml file from the specified archiveFile. This results in the retrieval of incorrect configuration and can lead to a corrupted view system.\r\n\r\nProposed Solution\r\nTo resolve this issue, we propose to modify the loading mechanism to prevent the delegation of the class loader, ensuring that the correct resource is loaded from the specified JAR file. By creating a URLClassLoader with a parent class loader set to null, we can isolate the resource loading process:\r\n\r\n```JAVA\r\ntry (URLClassLoader cl = new URLClassLoader(new URL[]{archiveFile.toURI().toURL()}, null)) {\r\n    // Load the configuration stream safely\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis change will ensure that the method only loads resources from the specified JAR file, avoiding conflicts with other JARs present in the classpath.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis improvement will enhance the reliability of the view loading mechanism in Ambari, preventing configuration errors and ensuring that the correct view metadata is always retrieved. We recommend merging this change to improve the robustness of the system.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test and unit tests\r\nBefore the patch was applied, an error occurred when clicking the Ambari Manager button.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e4a7b2f-599c-4e6b-b114-08d3e25aaa19)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter applying the patch, everything functions properly.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c01d23c1-d603-4d2a-916f-425dae8998e4)\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe main change is in this commit [4d37709](https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3908/commits/4d37709a41fe35b3ce144394b0b7e3efd1532d26). The other commits are due to ruff formatting. We can trust that ruff only changes the format and does not alter the meaning of the code or introduce errors.\r\n\r\nThe entire Ambari project has accumulated a large amount of Python code, which is the result of the collective efforts of multiple contributors to make Ambari better. \r\n\r\n| Language    | Files | Lines  | Code   | Comments | Blanks |\r\n|-------------|-------|--------|--------|----------|--------|\r\n| Java        | 3330  | 690679 | 427116 | 156389   | 107174 |\r\n| JavaScript  | 2125  | 512742 | 374238 | 87081    | 51423  |\r\n| Plain Text  | 68    | 500082 | 0      | 497409   | 2673   |\r\n| JSON        | 758   | 479988 | 479689 | 0        | 299    |\r\n| Python      | 1096  | 218057 | 175499 | 9547     | 33011  |\r\n| XML         | 1135  | 156581 | 130300 | 20189    | 6092   |\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this process, a problem has emerged: everyone has different coding styles, which leads to inconsistencies in the submitted code. This can result in various inconveniences, such as increased understanding costs of the underlying principles and greater difficulty in identifying the root causes of issues. As the codebase grows, these problems become increasingly apparent. Therefore, we are introducing [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff), along with some additional processes, to format the code and alleviate these issues.\r\n\r\nWhat is Ruff?\r\n\r\nAn extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust. Its speed is one of its advantages. More information can be found here: [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).\r\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix)\r\n\r\n\r\nRuff rules are derived from the Apache Superset project's rule file.\r\n\r\nRuff integration plan:\r\n1. Project integration with Ruff, formatting all Python files, ensuring all tests pass, and the cluster runs normally. Completed.\r\n2. Integration of Ruff detection into Jenkins. Completed.\r\n\r\nNotice: This PR's Ruff rules ignore some rule checks because these rules involve significant changes that will be addressed in subsequent PRs. The current PR ensures that all Python indentation and basic formatting conform to standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Ruff Usage Instructions in Ambari Code Submission\r\n\r\n**Install Ruff:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install ruff\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Format Code with Ruff:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nruff format .\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Check Code Format Manually:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nruff check .\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Check Code Format with Maven:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmvn exec:exec@ruff-check -Pruff-check\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Fix Code Format with Maven:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmvn exec:exec@ruff-format -Pruff-format\r\n```\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test CI/CD\r\nAfter formatting thousands of files with Ruff, I deployed a simple cluster to verify that Ambari runs smoothly, everything works well.\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b67663ba-c1a3-492a-97b2-edc49cd98ae0)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0b36d6b-dd8a-44d0-99ee-6ee836f0aa48)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83fe918b-2792-4ba3-827e-224e525fb35f)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44b9c74e-54f0-4b5c-99cc-b94eac36c7e8)\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.

server\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Background:\r\nThe Ambari Server uses the `JAVA_HOME` setting as its Java home during startup. Additionally, it propagates this `JAVA_HOME` to other components in the stack as their Java home. These components typically use JDK 8, which is set during the `ambari-server setup` process. The Ambari Server backend returns the `JAVA_HOME` in the Ambari-level parameters, which other components retrieve through Python scripts in the stack.\r\n\r\nHowever, after upgrading the Ambari Server to JDK 17, the current `setup` process does not allow setting a separate JDK 17 `JAVA_HOME` specifically for the Ambari Server. To address this, a new `ambari-java-home` configuration is introduced to allow the Ambari Server to use JDK 17 as its Java home while retaining the existing `JAVA_HOME` for other components.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Changes Introduced:\r\n1. **Added `ambari-java-home` Setting**  \r\n   - A new configuration option, `ambari-java-home`, is introduced to set a dedicated JDK 17 path for the Ambari Server.\r\n   - The backend will return this `ambari-java-home` value, enabling all tools in the stack that rely on Ambari's Java utilities to use the JDK 17 path.\r\n\r\n2. **Code Adjustments for Services**  \r\n   - Updated certain service scripts and tools that invoke Ambari's Java code to use the new `ambari-java-home` setting.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### New Feature: `--ambari-java-home` Option\r\nThe `ambari-server setup` command now includes a new option, `--ambari-java-home`, to specify a dedicated Java home for the Ambari Server. This allows the Ambari Server to use JDK 17 while other components continue to use JDK 8.\r\n\r\n#### Updated `ambari-server setup` Usage:\r\n```bash\r\nambari-server setup [OPTIONS]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### New Option:\r\n- `--ambari-java-home <java_home>`  \r\n   Specifies the Java home path for the Ambari Server.\r\n\r\n#### Example Usage:\r\n```bash\r\nambari-server setup -s \\\r\n                    -j /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk \\\r\n                    --ambari-java-home /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example:\r\n- `-j` specifies the default Java home (JDK 8) for other components.\r\n- `--ambari-java-home` specifies the dedicated Java home (JDK 17) for the Ambari Server.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n### Complete Example: Setting Up Ambari Server with Database and Java Configurations\r\n\r\nBelow is a complete example of configuring the Ambari Server, including database settings, default `JAVA_HOME`, and the new `--ambari-java-home` option:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nambari-server setup -s \\\r\n                    --jdbc-db mysql \\\r\n                    --jdbc-driver /path/to/mysql-connector-java.jar \\\r\n                    --database mysql \\\r\n                    --databasehost db.example.com \\\r\n                    --databaseport 3306 \\\r\n                    --databasename ambari \\\r\n                    --databaseusername ambari_user \\\r\n                    --databasepassword ambari_password \\\r\n                    -j /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk \\\r\n                    --ambari-java-home /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Explanation:\r\n1. **Database Configuration**  \r\n   - `--jdbc-db mysql`: Specifies the database type (e.g., `mysql`).\r\n   - `--jdbc-driver /path/to/mysql-connector-java.jar`: Path to the JDBC driver for the database.\r\n   - `--database mysql`: Specifies the database type.\r\n   - `--databasehost db.example.com`: Hostname of the database server.\r\n   - `--databaseport 3306`: Port number of the database server.\r\n   - `--databasename ambari`: Name of the Ambari database.\r\n   - `--databaseusername ambari_user`: Username for the database.\r\n   - `--databasepassword ambari_password`: Password for the database.\r\n\r\n2. **Java Configuration**  \r\n   - `-j /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk`: Specifies the default `JAVA_HOME` for components (JDK 8).\r\n   - `--ambari-java-home /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk`: Specifies the dedicated Java home for the Ambari Server (JDK 17).\r\n\r\n3. **Automated Setup**  \r\n   - `-s`: Skips interactive prompts for a fully automated setup.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Final Notes:\r\n- After running the setup command, restart the Ambari Server to apply the changes:\r\n  ```bash\r\n  ambari-server restart\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Ensure that the JDBC driver path and database credentials are correct before running the command.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test，unit test\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe database password character type requirement is too few.\r\nIt is recommended to support more character sets, For example: `!#$%@`. \r\n\r\nWhen the database password we set contains some special characters，we can still setup ambari-server succefully after applying this changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. Applying this changes\r\n2. Set the database password used by Ambari to contain special characters (eg `a-zA-Z0-9!#$%@_-`)\r\n3. Setup ambari-server \r\n\r\nPlease review [Ambari Contributing Guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AMBARI/How+to+Contribute) before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Remove the JVM parameters for the Ambari agent, as they are not needed. In the trunk branch, there are no JVM parameters in the Ambari agent's `ambari-env`.\r\n2. Add default values to the Ambari server's environment, otherwise, there will be an error due to missing JVM parameters during startup.\r\n3. Remove JVM parameters that are incompatible with JDK 17.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nunit tests, manual tests\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screen-shot;

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe shell.py is executed when installing services by ambari.\r\nHowever, there will be no failure when executing the shell.py because of some syntax error and undefined variables.\r\n\r\nThis changes will fix the syntax error and undefined variables in shell.py, and make the shell.py work well.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, when we compile Ambari using the following command, an error occurs:  Wrong order for 'com.google.gson.JsonElement' import.\r\n This changes can fix the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nApplying this changes, and manual test\r\n\r\nPlease review [Ambari Contributing Guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AMBARI/How+to+Contribute) before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR primarily addresses issues arising from the upgrade from JDK 8 to JDK 17, specifically related to Mockito's stricter 'when' matching, which caused some mocks to fail. Through debugging and comparing with JDK 8 code, nullable handling was implemented for potentially null values. Secondly, the upgrade made the Capture constructor private, preventing the creation of anonymous classes that override its setValue method through 'new Capture()'. The tests were rewritten to maintain the original test logic without changing the underlying implementation.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n unit tests, manual tests\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease review

to Mockito\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Migrate RecommendationResourceProviderTest from EasyMock to Mockito\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR migrates the `RecommendationResourceProviderTest` class from EasyMock to Mockito testing framework. This change is necessary to resolve compatibility issues when running tests under JDK 17.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Replaced EasyMock imports with Mockito imports\r\n- Updated `testCreateConfigurationResources` and `testCreateNotConfigurationResources` methods to use Mockito syntax\r\n- Refactored the `testCreateResources` helper method to use Mockito\r\n- Removed EasyMock dependency (if previously present)\r\n\r\n### Key Error Resolved\r\nThis PR addresses the following error that occurred after upgrading to JDK 17:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.ambari.server.controller.internal.RecommendationResourceProviderTest.testCreateConfigurationResources -- Time elapsed: 0.761 s <<< ERROR!\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: class jdk.proxy2.$Proxy42 cannot be cast to class [Ljava.lang.Object; (jdk.proxy2.$Proxy42 is in module jdk.proxy2 of loader 'app'; [Ljava.lang.Object; is in module java.base of loader 'bootstrap')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Possible Reasons for the Error\r\nThe error likely occurs due to changes in how JDK 17 handles dynamic proxies compared to JDK 8:\r\n\r\n1. Module System: JDK 17 uses a stronger module system, which can affect how classes from different modules interact.\r\n2. Proxy Implementation: The way proxies are implemented has changed in JDK 17, leading to incompatibilities with older mocking frameworks.\r\n3. Class Loader Differences: The error message indicates a mismatch between class loaders, which is more strictly enforced in JDK 17.\r\n4. EasyMock Compatibility: EasyMock may not be fully compatible with JDK 17, especially when it comes to creating proxies for array types.\r\n\r\nMigrating to Mockito, which is actively maintained and compatible with JDK 17, should resolve these issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n- unit tests have been updated and pass\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a12e2666-f6eb-4535-98c1-c25a8228e3db)\r\n\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. Ex: unit tests, manual tests)\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screen-shot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nPlease review [Ambari Contributing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nAfter upgrading from JDK 8 to JDK 17, the `testAllPropertiesHaveMarkdownDescriptions` test in `ConfigurationTest` was failing due to an `AnnotationFormatError`. This error occurred because PowerMock was modifying the `ClusterScale` annotation at runtime, adding an additional interface that conflicted with JDK 17's stricter annotation processing.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nTo resolve this issue, we have moved the `ConfigurationMarkdown` and `ClusterScale` annotations to separate files. This prevents PowerMock from modifying these specific annotations during test execution, allowing the test to pass successfully.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Created new files for `ConfigurationMarkdown` and `ClusterScale` annotations\r\n- Updated import statements where necessary\r\n- No functional changes to the annotations or their usage\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Verified that the `testAllPropertiesHaveMarkdownDescriptions` test now passes\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2669aefb-7c36-480c-a796-b0f5613d40cf)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nThis change highlights a potential incompatibility between PowerMock and JDK 17 when dealing with certain annotations. We may need to consider alternatives to PowerMock or update our testing strategy for future JDK upgrades.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease review [Ambari Contributing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nThe current build process for Ambari Server encounters issues during parallel compilation, resulting in an incomplete distribution package. Specifically, the Ambari Admin frontend is missing from the final package.\r\n\r\nCurrent build command:\r\n```\r\nmvn -T2C -B clean install package -Drat.skip=true -DskipTests -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dfindbugs.skip=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nRoot Cause:\r\n1. Ambari Server's `pom.xml` does not include a dependency on Ambari Admin.\r\n2. The assembly descriptor `src/main/assemblies/server.xml` packages Ambari Server, Agent, and Admin into the `ambari-server-*-dist` release package.\r\n3. During parallel compilation, if Ambari Server completes before Ambari Admin, the packaging process executes prematurely.\r\n4. This results in Ambari Admin's JAR file not being correctly included in the distribution package.\r\n\r\nCurrent relevant section in `server.xml`:\r\n```xml\r\n<fileSet>\r\n  <fileMode>644</fileMode>\r\n  <directory>${ambari-admin-dir}/target</directory>\r\n  <outputDirectory>/var/lib/ambari-server/resources/views</outputDirectory>\r\n  <includes>\r\n    <include>*.jar</include>\r\n  </includes>\r\n</fileSet>\r\n```\r\n\r\nProposed Solution:\r\n1. Add Ambari Admin as a dependency in Ambari Server's `pom.xml`.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n- Verify successful parallel compilation\r\n- Confirm the presence of Ambari Admin frontend in the final package\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e5a3ce1-7f05-40af-8be4-437e88ed1d21)\r\n\r\nThis fix ensures that all components, including Ambari Admin, are properly packaged during parallel compilation, resolving the issue of missing frontend upon installation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.

everyone has different coding styles, which leads to inconsistencies in the submitted code. This can result in various inconveniences, such as increased understanding costs of the underlying principles and greater difficulty in identifying the root causes of issues. As the codebase grows, these problems become increasingly apparent. Therefore, we are introducing [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff), along with some additional processes, to format the code and alleviate these issues.\r\n\r\nWhat is Ruff?\r\n\r\nAn extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust. Its speed is one of its advantages. More information can be found here: [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).\r\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix)\r\n\r\n\r\nRuff rules are derived from the Apache Superset project's rule file.\r\n\r\nRuff integration plan:\r\n1. Project integration with Ruff, formatting all Python files, ensuring all tests pass, and the cluster runs normally. Completed.\r\n2. Integration of Ruff detection into Jenkins. Completed.\r\n\r\nNotice: This PR's Ruff rules ignore some rule checks because these rules involve significant changes that will be addressed in subsequent PRs. The current PR ensures that all Python indentation and basic formatting conform to standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Ruff Usage Instructions in Ambari Code Submission\r\n\r\n**Install Ruff:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install ruff\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Format Code with Ruff:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nruff format .\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Check Code Format Manually:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nruff check .\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Check Code Format with Maven:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmvn exec:exec@ruff-check -Pruff-check\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Fix Code Format with Maven:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmvn exec:exec@ruff-format -Pruff-format\r\n```\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test CI/CD\r\nAfter formatting thousands of files with Ruff, I deployed a simple cluster to verify that Ambari runs smoothly.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7a97444-3847-42d4-bae2-4778952c3618)\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.
