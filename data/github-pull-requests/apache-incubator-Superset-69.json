SUMMARY\r\nIn order to display the 'View' button in the history tab of the SQL Lab, the query must have a resultsKey.\r\nWhen the query is executed in sync mode, that key was not properly propagated from the API to the FE, thus, the button did not appeared after execution.\r\n\r\nThe button did appeared once the running polling watching for queries updated, since that fetches fresh results from the api.\r\n\r\nThis PR forwards that key to make the button show for every successfully executed query.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/169911455-0efe3c95-ca74-4c53-89fc-dd44443c1243.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/169911632-cb68efb8-04ca-451c-a6bc-3bca5ac930a9.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Configure a database for sync mode\r\n2. Run queries in SQL Lab in that database\r\n3. Check query history\r\n\r\nEnsure that, if the queries are successful, the 'View' button always displays.\r\nEnsure it works for both sync/async query execution flows.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

number of updates for the Trino engine including:\r\n\r\n1. Making the `TrinoEngineSpec` derive from the `PrestoEngineSpec` rather than the `BaseEngineSpec`. I'm not really sure as to why the later was used as it violates the DRY principle and also means that many of the Presto customizations—which Trino is forked from—were previously not defined.\r\n2. Renames `trinonative` to `trino`—which requires a PyHive bump—thanks to @betodealmeida's work https://github.com/dropbox/PyHive/pull/428. I thought there was merit going forward using `trino` rather than `trinonative` everywhere.\r\n3. Added a `TrinoTemplateProcessor` so macros like `{{ trino.latest_partition(...) }}` etc. can be used. Note made sure the processor also supported the `presto` key for backwards compatibility given that it is likely people will be migrating from Presto and the `presto` key is likely embedded in saved queries, virtual datasets, etc.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen exporting a SQL Lab result set with a integer column containing `NULL` values, Numpy/Pandas coerces them to floats during the `pd.DataFrame.applymap(...)` call given that `NaN` is actually a float, i.e., \r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import pyarrow as pa\r\n>>>\r\n>>> df = pa.array([1, 2, None]).to_pandas(integer_object_nulls=True).to_frame()\r\n>>> df\r\n      0\r\n0     1\r\n1     2\r\n2  None\r\n>>>\r\n>>> df.applymap(lambda x: x)\r\n     0\r\n0  1.0\r\n1  2.0\r\n2  NaN\r\n```\r\n\r\nType coercion in Pandas is overly magical and often undesirable. The fix is somewhat yuck as well, iterating over the columns and rows of the DataFrame and escaping only those cells which are actually `str`.\r\n\r\nI tried a number of more performant/vectorized solutions but at the end of the day they rely on `numpy.array`s which require a priori declared types otherwise coercion is performed. Note the `numpy.dtype(object)`  data type is used to handled both strings an integers—as a byproduct of how data is exported from PyArrow—given special handling is required for dealing wiith missing values with integers per [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/gotchas.html#support-for-integer-na). The TL;DR is this is all very unpleasant.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nAdded unit

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSwitching out all references of `ConnectorRegistry` to `DatasourceDAO`. In the PR, we are focusing on just removing the references and moving towards allowing other Datasources to power charts. \r\n\r\nOne issue is the circular dependencies that are blocking us from fully removing the logic to allow the app to run. So i've moved that code out the `ConnectorRegistry` for now and will prioritize a bigger refactor to stop the import issues in superset moving forward.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR aims to add the \"Select all\" feature to the Select component. Adding this feature to a synchronous Select is really simple. The problem arises when adding \"Select all\" to an asynchronous, paginated, searchable, and keep selected on top Select. We have many technical challenges and design considerations as you can see [here](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/43937/how-should-the-select-all-select-when-paginating-elements). Some of the requirements we need to address:\r\n- Select all items when only some pages are loaded on the client-side. Selecting only the visible items was discarded because, in our context, the majority of times the user is actually selecting all values. We also don't want to force the user to load all items before being able to select them.\r\n- Load new items as selected when \"Selected all\" is active \r\n- Unselect a set of items when \"Select all\" is active and not all pages have been loaded on the client-side\r\n- Keep the order of selected items during user interactions\r\n- Automatically \"Select all\" when all items have been selected and not all pages have been loaded on the client-side. One example here is when the user opens the Select, one page is loaded, the user clicks on \"Select all\", unselects one item, and selects the same item again. At this point, we should go back to the \"Select all\" mode even though we only have one page loaded.\r\n- Handle the payload size. We shouldn't send all selected items to the server-side because we don't know how many can exist, which could result in huge payload size. What we need to do is to come up with a payload that represents the user selection in an efficient way. One example would be if a user selects all items and unselects a subset, we could send a value representing the \"Select all\" alongside the subset of unselected items.\r\n- Write tests that are able to scroll the component, trigger new page loads, and test the above scenarios.\r\n- Expand the storybook to account for the new requirements.\r\n- We also need to split the component into two (sync and async). It's very clear that the behaviors are different and we can significantly reduce code complexity if we treat them as different components.\r\n- Add support to the new payload format to the API endpoints\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70410625/169524505-ac812e6c-29ab-4671-a198-03600a02b94d.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING

BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nThe recent PR #20097 added explicit support for `null`-valued control panel sections. However, due to lacking TS coverage and type declarations in the codebase, these weren't always being checked properly. This caused Explore to fail to render when opening a Mixted timeseries chart with the `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` feature flag disabled.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds some missing types and filtering using the new type guard introduced in the aforementioned PR to ensure null sections are always skipped. A null value is also added to a control panel section fixture to make sure it doesn't break the utils.\r\n\r\nTip: enable \"Hide whitespace\" when reviewing the diff:\r\n<img width=\"243\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/169534051-4e79cc8c-c323-4f82-8597-54588259529d.png\">\r\n\r\nNote that this regression uncovered a pretty serious mistyping of the chart control panel config registry, but fixing it is beyond the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR changes time formatting to be the default for temporal columns (previously defaulted to showing the original value). This is done by replacing the `timeFormattedColumns` with `originalFormattedTimeColumns` throughout the codebase, meaning if a dataset doesn't have defined values for them, they will default to using the time formatter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to changing the default, the `DataTableTemporalHeaderCell` will only be shown for tables where the first cell value isn't a string value. This is because some databases like Druid and SQLite return temporal data in string format, which causes the time formatter to convert the timestamp to UTC, causing x hours of offset. (For Finland, this would show all dates to show as 10 pm the previous day).\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the formatted option is the new default:\r\n<img width=\"782\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/169496400-9ebb9fa1-c54f-4050-88b5-11c9476eac86.png\">\r\n\r\nFor datasets that have string-based temporal data, the regular non-temporal header is shown (screenshot from SQLite). Notice the first column `ds` which doesn't have the formatting cog:\r\n<img width=\"788\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/169496622-2fe47652-7a20-4671-b96e-f96f093e44ba.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user enters chart creation flow starting from a dashboard (e.g. with \"Create chart\" button in empty state or charts list in dashboard edit mode), the chart's save modal should have that dashboard's name prefilled.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\n#19917 migrated the `convert_dttm` functions in the Presto and Trino db engine specs to use the currently recommended literal timestamp type cast over the now deprecated `from_iso8601_*` functions. However, the new literal casts require the separator to be a blank space instead of the \"T\" separator:\r\n\r\n- https://trino.io/docs/current/functions/datetime.html\r\n- https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/datetime.html\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the format to correspond with the supported format and updates the unit tests accordingly. In addition, the `convert_dttm` tests are removed from the legacy integration test suite, as they're already covered by the new unit tests.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nIn order to mitigate sensitive data leaking to less-privileged users when they load a cached dashboard/chart, this PR enables caching per user when a database has impersonation enabled.\r\n\r\nIn our setup, we delegate permissions to database (Snowflake via OAuth) and we don't want to create and maintain another layer of ACLs in Superset. \r\n\r\nDiscussion on this on [slack](https://apache-superset.slack.com/archives/C7G8CG0LR/p1572450733117200).\r\n\r\nThis is an initial solution, happy to adjust it as per maintainers' feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR makes the chart title in dashboard clickable - redirects to Explore on click. It's basically a shortcut for clicking options -> Edit chart.\r\nOn hover the title gets underlined + tooltip appears with prompt to click \"Click to edit _chart name_ in a new tab\".\r\nThis effect is active only in non edit mode and when user has access to Explore\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/169046626-aa1ab0e6-cf6c-43fe-b329-202cc3d78a1a.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nFlow 1\r\n1. Go to dashboard\r\n2. Hover over a chart title - it should get underlined and a tooltip should appear\r\n3. Click and verify that you got redirected to Explore in a new tab\r\n\r\nFlow 2\r\n1.

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCurrently load examples creates duplicate schema and dataset permissions like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[None].[covid_vaccines](id:19)\r\n[examples].[covid_vaccines](id:19)\r\n[None].[channel_members](id:22)\r\n[examples].[channel_members](id:22)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is due to the fact that a SqlaTable can be created without an associated database triggering SQLAlchemy listen `set_perm` with a None database. \r\nThis is a simple/patch fix, we should revisit the entire logic around creating permissions for datasets, databases and schemas since it's possible to have orphaned permissions also when (for example) a database name is changed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS

SUMMARY\r\nAfter enabling the `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` feature flag, timeseries charts that were created before enabling the flag won't render in Explore due to the required x-axis control being unset. This PR checks if the feature flag is enabled, and sets the default value of the x-axis control to the value of the `granularity_sqla` flag if the value of the x-axis control is unset.\r\n\r\nDue to mixing of JS and TS and inconsistent function calls (e.g. calling a function with `null` when it was expecting `ControlPanelState`, all while having logic for when the value was in fact `null`), some of this code was slightly difficult to follow. I tried to refactor it to be more intuitive, but even minor refactoring seemed to cause weird regressions, so I decided to postpone the refactor to a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the timeseries chart that was saved before the feature flag was enabled opens up correctly:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/169009593-9a494ef1-6f52-483d-a1c3-2f91df433886.mp4\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously, the chart would not render, as the required x-axis control was unset in the chart form data:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/169009759-044e4a77-3936-4990-beef-aa2edf1bb212.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a Chart using the Time - Series Bar Chart V2.\r\n2. Add it to a Dashboard.\r\n3. Enable the GENERIC_CHART_AXES FF.\r\n4. Access the Dashboard - note that the Chart is still working.\r\n5. Click on \"Edit Chart\" and notice how the chart no longer renders in Explore\r\n\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\nAdd support for generic x-axis to Mixed Time-Series chart. In addition do the following changes:\r\n- Make the chart name and description dependent on the feature flag\r\n- Implement temporal x-axis scaling that was introduced in #19686\r\n- Remove the \"Predictive\" tag from the Mixed chart (it doesn't support the predictive analytics functionality)\r\n- Explicitly support `null` values on the control panel section config and make the check explicit with a type guard\r\n- Minor refactoring/cleanup\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nWhen the feature flag is enabled, the x-axis control appears, making it possible to use a non-temporal x-axis:\r\n<img width=\"1188\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/168807749-b021c04c-8902-4b4f-a7a4-f21544fb678e.png\">\r\n\r\nNow the chart is called \"Mixed chart\" instead of \"Mixed Time-series Chart\":\r\n<img width=\"1071\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/168809541-f40a5266-de25-4276-b8c3-5539c8d046af.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Enable `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` feature flag\r\n2. Go to chart picker and notice that `Mixed time-series chart` has been replaced with `Mixed chart` with a description that doesn't mention the words \"timeseries\" or \"temporal\"\r\n3. \r\n\r\n###

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nColumn types not detected when creating Virtual Dataset.\r\n\r\nIf we create a virtual dataset, and try to create a chart based on it, some column types may not be detected as it was defined in original dataset. It was because some columns had no any non-null values when we run the SQL to create a dataset. \r\nThe previous version was tracking column type of columns from the query result values, and that's why some columns had null type even though it had exact type in original dataset. \r\n\r\nTo fix this, we need to track the column type from original dataset, not a SQL query running result value.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39701522/168673931-73577f6d-da20-4179-b797-1468d9441466.png)\r\n\r\n**AFTER**:\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-05-16 at 16 01 45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39701522/168673789-edcd62f3-9fd2-4d72-a54d-789f9bdb139a.png)\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-05-16 at 16 03 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39701522/168673819-13c6ecca-6370-407a-9d81-fcb9027f7072.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nBump Pandas to latest minor (from 1.34 to 1.4.2) and PyArrow (from 5.0.0 to 6.0.1, the latest version supported by the current BigQuery driver). Historically PyArrow has been very stable, and PyArrow 6.0.1 was released in Oct 2021, so there should be minimal risk in upgrading. In addition, Pandas 1.4.0 was released in January, so any relevant regressions should have surfaced by the release of 1.4.2.\r\n\r\nPandas 1.4 introduced support for using `pyarrow` as an engine for reading CSVs, which brings performance improvements (see https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/v1.4.0.html#multi-threaded-csv-reading-with-a-new-csv-engine-based-on-pyarrow for details). Therefore `engine=\"pyarrow\"` has been added everywhere we're calling `pd.read_csv`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently updating a `database_name` or deleting a database does not update or delete any associated permissions.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\nCreating a database named `db1` with 2 datasources named: (`ds1`, `ds2`), creates the following permissions:\r\n`database_access` -> `[db1](id:1)`\r\n`datasource_access` -> `[db1].[ds1](id:1)`\r\n`datasource_access` -> `[db1].[ds2](id:2)`\r\n\r\nThen updating the database name to `db1_updated`, leaves the permissions at the following state:\r\n`database_access` -> `[db1](id:1)`\r\n`datasource_access` -> `[db1].[ds1](id:1)`\r\n`datasource_access` -> `[db1].[ds2](id:2)`\r\n`database_access` -> `[db2](id:1)`\r\n`datasource_access` -> `[db2].[ds1](id:1)`\r\n`datasource_access` -> `[db2].[ds2](id:2)`\r\n\r\nThis means that changing a database_name will remove access to all non admin users to that database on SQLLab. Besides leaving orphaned permissions on the DB.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the permissions has expected, final result:\r\n`database_access` -> `[db2](id:1)`\r\n`datasource_access` -> `[db2].[ds1](id:1)`\r\n`datasource_access` -> `[db2].[ds2](id:2)`\r\n\r\n\r\ncc: @zephyring \r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the contribution operation is applied after flattening, despite only being meant to apply to numeric columns. By ensuring that the dataframe is unflattened, the index columns will always be absent from the columns, which ensures that the index is not used in the contribution calculation. Also, in the case of using a numeric index, applying the contribution calculation after flattening would cause the index to leak into the contribution calculation. In addition to the fix, falsy post transformation ops are removed to clean up the request payload (these cause unnecessary cache misses).\r\n\r\nThere is already a check that should remove any non-numeric columns:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/4435e53901df4d64992a540694fbd3d5489c2220/superset/utils/pandas_postprocessing/contribution.py#L51\r\n\r\nHowever, for some reason this currently also returns string-columns (`object`), possibly due to the `Decimal` type extending `object` (seems weird, I know, but the only reason I could come up with). However, I didn't want to make any changes to this logic in this PR, as refining it will probably require additional tests to be added + we should potentially bump Pandas to 1.4 before changing this.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow calculating contributions works when `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` enabled:\r\n<img width=\"1281\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/168591012-563cf83e-44fd-4c19-839d-4d1e363b2f31.png\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously it would fail:\r\n<img width=\"1276\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/168591129-f8f1f0eb-c898-41b9-8c26-689884498516.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Enable `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` feature flag\r\n2. Create a chart with a non-temporal x-axis\r\n3.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR is an attempt to provide a way of customising the format of the numbers and currency displayed in superset frontend.\r\nIt is linked to (at least) issues #3972, #18938, #11328, #8913\r\nPlease also look at PR #17796, which provides a different approach to the same issue.  \r\n\r\nDesign choice:\r\n- the user can change the following d3 **number** formatting parameters: decimal, thousands, grouping, currency, numerals, percent, minus and nan\r\n- this change does not include the **time formatting** parameters, since I believe it to be a different issue\r\n- unlike #17796, it does not tie the format to the `LANGUAGES` config key: the user can use different parameters for the frontend language and number formatting\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n- in config.py, add a D3_FORMAT dictionary with [d3 locale settings](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/main/README.md#locale_format) \r\n- check the number formatting on any chart\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: #3972, #18938, #11328, #8913\r\n- [x] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval

SUMMARY\r\nWhen running the migration `a9422eeaae74_new_dataset_models_take_2.py` from #19421 I ran into a problem where some old faulty database metadata caused the migration to fail.

SUMMARY\r\n[The copy command](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand), though largely still supported, is deprecated.\r\n\r\nIn Safari, latest versions, the copy to clipboard of a permalink no longer works because of it.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for the Clipboard API, with all the nuances and small differences between the different browser engines. Be sure to read the comments & associated discussions linked for more information.\r\n\r\n[The new API is not yet fully supported by all browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=clipboard%20api), so the current copy code was left as a fallback.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIn Superset's config file, there is a config option called `DEFAULT_VIZ_TYPE` which you can use to define which viz you would like to use in the chart explorer by default. This is a very useful config option, especially when you have a custom viz you would like to use instead of the Superset `Table` viz. However, when you are in SQL Lab and you want to create and explore a dataset, there is currently no way to to change the default viz which will be used. \r\n\r\nThis PR allows for the `DEFAULT_VIZ_TYPE` config option to also be used by SQL Lab when you want to explore a dataset. This allows for consistency between the chart explorer, and exploring through SQL Lab.\r\n\r\nThe changes include modifying the front-end index file so that instead of hard coding the `table` viz, it drops the `viz_type` variable entirely. This way, we can set the now undefined `viz_type` to the `DEFAULT_VIZ_TYPE` within the back-end. Another change that was made was passing the `selectedColumns` object to the back-end, and only populating the `all_columns` variable if the `DEFAULT_VIZ_TYPE` is a `table`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Modify the config file so that the `DEFAULT_VIZ_TYPE` is a different viz from the standard `Table` (e.g., `pivot_table`).\r\n2. Within Superset, select \"SQL Lab\" from the top menu.\r\n3. Select \"SQL Editor\" from the drop down menu which was opened during step 2.\r\n4. On the left side of the page, select a database and schema that you would like to run the test query on.\r\n5. For testing purposes, add some basic SQL to run against a table (e.g., `SELECT * FROM table_1;`).\r\n6. Select the `Run` button which will run the query.\r\n7. Once the results are displayed under the \"Results\" tab, select the `Explore` button to explore the result set in the data exploration view.\r\n8. Once the exploration view opens, you should see the viz type you defined in step 1 selected in the \"Visualization Type\" section.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently using a Custom SQL expression with the `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` produces unexpected results. Here we ensure all post processing operations that support generic x-axes also support custom SQL adhoc columns. In addition, the `transformProps` of the ECharts Timeseries chart is update to properly handle custom SQL adhoc columns.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the chart renders as expected:\r\n<img width=\"935\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/168270256-0799423e-fe04-4ff4-b586-c2e0e68a6cf9.png\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously the chart data request returned zero rows:\r\n<img width=\"923\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/168270415-9c0d498c-f89b-4578-9f54-174281ad1701.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Enable `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` feature flag\r\n2. create a new chart using one of the ECharts plugin charts, e.g. the scatter plot\r\n3. add a Custom SQL x-axis expression and any metric\r\n4. Create chart and see that no rows are returned\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWe implemented the possibility to set individual resource limitations for every Superset component including _supersetNode_, _supersetWorker_ and _supersetCeleryBeat_. For this reason, we added the values _supersetNode.resources_, _supersetWorker.resources_ and _supersetCeleryBeat.resources_ to the values file, the Helm Schema and the Helm Templates. These pod specific values overwrite the global resource limits and requests set via the values resources. This feature introduction will not break current deployments using the value resources and only implement additional functionality.\r\nThis change allows for a more customizable experience and a more optimized user experience when deploying Superset using the Helm Chart.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nUsing the command Helm template it is possible to verify if the resources limit and requests are set correctly.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nThis error was detected on a particular dashboard, for a particular set of conditions and only in chrome.\r\n\r\nThe truncation, in this case, refers to the right content of the `SCOPE` row.\r\n<img width=\"491\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-11 at 01 12 00\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/167767707-cc5461c1-91a1-4575-9fba-142c64ab7627.png\">\r\n\r\nThe `useTruncate` function computes the truncated elements by trying to fit one element at a time in the with of their container.\r\nProblem is, by using this information to truncate the element, and add the `+X` next to it, we're changing the container size, thus triggering another pass at this function.\r\nThis, in 99.9% of the cases is fine, but, in very subtle conditions, it can change the truncated count back and forth, if:\r\n* the size taken by the `+X` removes the space needed by the last visible element by 1\r\n* the subtle size gain by the `+(X - 1)` tag makes enough room for the removed element to appear again.\r\n\r\nIn this dashboard, the change was between +10 and +11, which has a very different pixel difference, but enough to cause the re-rendering loop.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures we only compute the truncated elements if their size changes, or if the size of the parent of the container changes.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nFor the reasons specified above, and given that the dashboard has private data, no gif is available.\r\nSuffice to say, no change should be visible, the popup and truncation should remain the same for every other use case.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nEnsure that the native filters popup content displays correctly, and that the truncation still works as expected.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n* Rationale: Saving a resource is not always instantaneous. In the `AddDatasetModal`, while a dataset is being saved, the primary \"Add\" button is not disabled - allowing user to click on the \"Add\" button multiple times while the resource is being saved. This allows the user to add duplicate datasets\r\n* This PR adds a `primaryButtonLoading` prop to the `Modal` component\r\n* The `AddDatasetModal` passes a loading prop to the `Modal` component while the resource creation is loading\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23270317/167711073-cefa43b5-0eb1-4dc0-9bba-566e74dd3091.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n* Add delay to `superset.datasets.api.py` in the POST function on the `\\` path (dataset creation path)\r\n* Add a new dataset and verify that the button is disabled & loading while the dataset is being created\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you
