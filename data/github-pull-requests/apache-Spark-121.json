What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove the support of `spark.akka.*` configs and related warnings.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Apache Spark 2.0+ is not using Akka, but some of `spark.akka.*` configs are still accepted as alternative values from deprecated configs.\r\n- Due to the Akka's License change, we had better be clear that Apache Spark is irrelevant to Akka even in config names.\r\n  - https://www.lightbend.com/blog/why-we-are-changing-the-license-for-akka\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, we don't have a word `spark.akka`.\r\n```\r\n$ git grep spark.akka\r\n```\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, we will ignore `spark.akka.*`, but it's inevitable in order to remove any user confusions due to the config naming, `spark.akka.*`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually review.","created_at":"2022-09-10T00:28:35Z","updated_at":"2022-09-10T22:47:17Z","closed_at":"2022-09-10T04:17:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ea0b1c10d40e491ecafd0f936674c1bae1da519b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37849/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37849/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37849/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c9df5a4a4231b165b83232a4a548290b1705cfa6","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-40401","ref":"SPARK-40401","sha":"c9df5a4a4231b165b83232a4a548290b1705cfa6","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c7484b17be8e48baa1148818eee33e21946affc5","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to upgrade slf4j from 1.7.36 to 2.0.3, the main change as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Upgrade slf4j version from 1.7.36 to 2.0.3\r\n2. Use ` log4j-slf4j2-impl` instead of ` log4j-slf4j-impl` refer to https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/log4j-slf4j-impl/index.html\r\n3. Adapt to the implementation of `Logging.isLog4j2()`, slf4j2 uses `SLF4JServiceProvider` instead of `StaticLoggerBinder`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nslf4j 1.7.36 is no longer actively developed, and the current stable and actively developed version of slf4j is 2.0.3.\r\n\r\n- https://www.slf4j.org/news.html\r\n- https://www.slf4j.org/faq.html#changesInVersion200\r\n-

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFixes a bug, the new spec in the ExpressionsEncoderSuite shows that this is in fact a bug. \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it fixes a bug.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew and existing specs in ExpressionEncoderSuite and ObjectExpressionsSuite.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change the type of `messageParameters` passed to Spark exception (via constructors) from array of strings to map of pair of strings. The map contains parameters names from `error-classes.json` as keys, and parameters values as map's values. While formatting error messages using the templates from `error-classes.json`, the formatter can fail w/ an internal error if it cannot find a parameter in the map passed to the current exception. The map of message parameters can contain more elements then used by the template.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```scala\r\nnew AnalysisException(\r\n  errorClass = \"UNSUPPORTED_GENERATOR\",\r\n  errorSubClass = \"MULTI_GENERATOR\",\r\n  messageParameters = Array(clause, generators.size.toString, generators.map(toSQLExpr).mkString(\", \")))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```scala\r\nnew AnalysisException(\r\n  errorClass = \"UNSUPPORTED_GENERATOR\",\r\n  errorSubClass = \"MULTI_GENERATOR\",\r\n  messageParameters = Map(\r\n    \"clause\" -> clause,\r\n    \"num\" -> generators.size.toString,\r\n    \"generators\" -> generators.map(toSQLExpr).mkString(\", \")))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAt the moment, the order of error message parameters cannot be changed in `error-classes.json` independently from the source code where the parameters are passed as arrays. After the changes, the tech editors/users can change the error messages including the order of params or skip some params w/ modifying Spark's code base (including tests).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ErrorParserSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue in `arrays_zip` function where a field index was used as a column name in the resulting schema which was a regression from Spark 3.1. With this change, the original behaviour is restored: a corresponding struct field name will be used instead of a field index.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```sql\r\nwith q as (\r\n  select\r\n    named_struct(\r\n      'my_array', array(1, 2, 3),\r\n      'my_array2', array(4, 5, 6)\r\n    ) as my_struct\r\n)\r\nselect\r\n  arrays_zip(my_struct.my_array, my_struct.my_array2)\r\nfrom\r\n  q\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould return schema: \r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- arrays_zip(my_struct.my_array, my_struct.my_array2): array (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- element: struct (containsNull = false)\r\n |    |    |-- 0: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |-- 1: integer (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is somewhat inaccurate. PR adds handling of `GetStructField` expression to return the struct field names like this:\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- arrays_zip(my_struct.my_array, my_struct.my_array2): array (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- element: struct (containsNull = false)\r\n |    |    |-- my_array: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |-- my_array2: integer (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, `arrays_zip` function returns struct field names now as in Spark 3.1 instead of field indices. \r\nSome users might have worked around this issue so this patch would affect them by bringing back the original behaviour.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn Spark SQL, the method `canUpCast` returns true iff we can safely up-cast the `from` type to `to` type without truncating or precision loss or possible runtime failures.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, DecimalType(10, 0) is considered as `canUpCast` to Integer type. This is wrong since casting `9000000000BD` as Integer type will overflow.\r\n\r\nAs a result:\r\n\r\n* The optimizer rule `SimplifyCasts` replies on the method `canUpCast` and it will mistakenly convert `cast(cast(9000000000BD as int) as long)` as `cast(9000000000BD as long)`\r\n* The STRICT store assignment policy relies on this method too. With the policy enabled, inserting `9000000000BD` into integer columns will pass compiling time check and insert an unexpected value `410065408`.\r\n* etc...\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix on the method `Cast.canUpCast`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, fix a bug on the checking condition of whether a decimal can safely cast as integral types.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new optimizer rule: `EliminateV1DynamicPartitionWrites`. This new rule supports convert dynamic partition writes to statis partition writes if the dynamic column is Literal which has been optimzied by `ConstantFolding` for datasource table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf the partition column is actually foldable, it's is same with static partition. So there is no needed to do an extra local sort to ensure the same partition values are continuous.\r\n\r\nBesides, the dataframe write api does not support specify the static partition spec so users always do dynamic partition writes, e.g.\r\n```java\r\ndf.selectExpr(\"*\", \"x\" as p).write.partitionBy(\"p\").save\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, improve the performance\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR used to improve the implementation of Spark `Decimal`. The improvement points are as follows:\r\n1. Use `toJavaBigDecimal` instead of  `toBigDecimal.bigDecimal` \r\n2. Extract `longVal / POW_10(_scale)` as a new method `def actualLongVal: Long`\r\n3. Remove `BIG_DEC_ZERO` and use `decimalVal.signum` to judge whether or not equals zero.\r\n4. Use `<` instead of `compare`.\r\n5. Correct some code style. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove the implementation of Spark Decimal\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nJust update the inner implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nN/A\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-08T06:43:24Z","updated_at":"2022-09-16T02:17:06Z","closed_at":"2022-09-15T12:51:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9f18cc7764d0e2e296cf975148950c3859fc5d80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37830/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37830/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37830/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9af453d18034b95f54d4b58d2adf07edcce0eb57","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-40387","ref":"SPARK-40387","sha":"9af453d18034b95f54d4b58d2adf07edcce0eb57","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDo base image real in time build only when infra dockerfile is changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRecently github ghcr is [unstable](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/32184), so we better use infra static image when no infra dockerfile changes.\r\n\r\nAfter this change even github ghcr image write has some issue, only infra dockerfile PR is blocked, other PR don't have any impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. CI passed, and [use](https://github.com/Yikun/spark/runs/8242449708?check_suite_focus=true#step:2:19) the `ghcr.io/apache/spark/apache-spark-github-action-image-cache:master-static`.\r\n2. local test infra changes trigger CI: https://github.com/Yikun/spark/pull/170\r\n3. test `./dev/is-changed.py -m

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `RewriteDistinctAggregates`, when grouping aggregate expressions by function children, treat children that are semantically equivalent as the same.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis PR will reduce the number of projections in the Expand operator when there are multiple distinct aggregations with superficially different children. In some cases, it will eliminate the need for an Expand operator.\r\n\r\nExample: In the following query, the Expand operator creates 3\\*n rows (where n is the number of incoming rows) because it has a projection for each of function children `b + 1`, `1 + b` and `c`.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate or replace temp view v1 as\r\nselect * from values\r\n(1, 2, 3.0),\r\n(1, 3, 4.0),\r\n(2, 4, 2.5),\r\n(2, 3,

projections (each producing a row for each incoming row):\r\n```\r\n[a#87, null, null, 0, null, UnscaledValue(c#89)], <== projection #1 (for regular aggregation)\r\n[a#87, (b#88 + 1), null, 1, null, null],          <== projection #2 (for distinct aggregation of b + 1)\r\n[a#87, null, (1 + b#88), 2, (c#89 > 0.0), null]], <== projection #3 (for distinct aggregation of 1 + b)\r\n```\r\nIn reality, the Expand only needs one projection for `1 + b` and `b + 1`, because they are semantically equivalent.\r\n\r\nWith the proposed change, the Expand operator's projections look like this:\r\n```\r\n[a#67, null, 0, null, UnscaledValue(c#69)],  <== projection #1 (for regular aggregations)\r\n[a#67, (b#68 + 1), 1, (c#69 > 0.0), null]],  <== projection #2 (for distinct aggregation on b + 1 and 1 + b)\r\n```\r\nWith one less projection, Expand produces 2\\*n rows instead of 3\\*n rows, but still produces the correct result.\r\n\r\nIn the case where all distinct aggregates have semantically equivalent children, the Expand operator is not needed at all.\r\n\r\nBenchmark code in the JIRA (SPARK-40382).\r\n\r\nBefore the PR:\r\n```\r\ndistinct aggregates:

**What changes were proposed in this pull request?**\r\nModified the code such that incorrect canonicalization  involving commutative expressions are fixed.\r\nThis is done through:\r\n1) Reordering the flattened commutative expressions , before parent's canonicalization happens\r\n2) Make it a single pass\r\n3) Remove the precanonicalized variable.\r\n4) avoiding multiple redundant children node tree traversal\r\n5) eliminates the need of invoking \"precanonicalize or canonicalized\" in various specific expressions like, udf, subquery etc)\r\n5) Only the node on which canonicalize is called , has the canonicalized field initialized. \r\n6) There are two perf bench mark tests which are now better in the sense 200 ms -> 80ms\r\nand 700 ms -> 110ms\r\n\r\n### **Why are the changes needed?**\r\nTo fix the regression caused in [PR-34883](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34883)\r\nThe change in the canonicalization of expressions to split in 2 parts ( precanonicalization & canonicalization) has broken the canonicalization logic involving commutative expressions if they are sub-expressions of BinaryComparisonExpression or any expression which swaps operands based on hashCode\r\nConsider following expression:\r\n```\r\na + b > 10\r\n\r\n           GT\r\n\r\n            |\r\n\r\na + b            10\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe BinaryComparison operator in the precanonicalize, first precanonicalizes  children & then   may swap operands based on left /right hashCode inequality..\r\n\r\nlets say  Add(a + b) .hashCode is >  10.hashCode as a result GT is converted to LT\r\n\r\nBut If the same tree is created \r\n```\r\n             GT\r\n\r\n               |\r\n\r\n b + a           10\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe hashCode of Add(b, a) is not same as Add(a, b) , thus it is possible that for this tree\r\n\r\n Add(b + a) .hashCode is <  10.hashCode  in which case GT remains as is.\r\n\r\nThus to similar trees result in different canonicalization , one having GT other having LT \r\n\r\nThe problem occurs because  for commutative expressions only the  canonicalize normalizes the expression so hashCode is consistent which is not the case with precanonicalize as the hashCode of commutative expression 's precanonicalize and post canonicalize are different.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to ensure that for commutative expressions the hashCode of  pre-canonicalize and canonicalize is same even if the order of the children of the Commutative expression is changed.\r\n\r\n### **Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?**\r\nNo user facing changes\r\n\r\n###

A separate future change can relax the restriction and support constant-folding to serializable `ObjectType` as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis fixes a regression introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35207 . It enabled the constant-folding logic to aggressively fold `InvokeLike` expressions (e.g. `Invoke`, `StaticInvoke`), when all arguments are foldable and the expression itself is deterministic. But it could go overly aggressive and constant-fold to non-serializable results, which would be problematic when that result needs to be serialized and sent over the wire.\r\n\r\nIn the wild, users of sparksql-scalapb have hit this issue. The constant folding logic would fold a chain of `Invoke` / `StaticInvoke` expressions from only holding onto a serializable literal to holding onto a non-serializable literal:\r\n```\r\nLiteral(com.example.protos.demo.Person$@...).scalaDescriptor.findFieldByNumber.get\r\n```\r\nthis expression works fine before constant-folding because the literal that gets sent to the executors is serializable, but when aggressive constant-folding kicks in it ends up as a `Literal(scalapb.descriptors.FieldDescriptor@...)` which isn't serializable.\r\n\r\nThe following minimal repro demonstrates this issue:\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.Column\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.UnresolvedAttribute\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Literal\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.objects.{Invoke, StaticInvoke}\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types.{LongType, ObjectType}\r\nclass NotSerializableBoxedLong(longVal: Long) { def add(other: Long): Long = longVal + other }\r\ncase class SerializableBoxedLong(longVal: Long) { def toNotSerializable(): NotSerializableBoxedLong = new NotSerializableBoxedLong(longVal) }\r\nval litExpr = Literal.fromObject(SerializableBoxedLong(42L), ObjectType(classOf[SerializableBoxedLong]))\r\nval toNotSerializableExpr = Invoke(litExpr, \"toNotSerializable\", ObjectType(classOf[NotSerializableBoxedLong]))\r\nval addExpr = Invoke(toNotSerializableExpr, \"add\", LongType, Seq(UnresolvedAttribute.quotedString(\"id\")))\r\nval df = spark.range(2).select(new Column(addExpr))\r\ndf.collect\r\n```\r\nwould result in an error if aggressive constant-folding kicked in:\r\n```\r\n...\r\nCaused by: java.io.NotSerializableException: NotSerializableBoxedLong\r\nSerialization stack:\r\n\t- object not serializable (class: NotSerializableBoxedLong, value: NotSerializableBoxedLong@71231636)\r\n\t- element of array (index: 1)\r\n\t- array (class [Ljava.lang.Object;, size 2)\r\n\t- element of array (index: 1)\r\n\t- array (class [Ljava.lang.Object;, size 3)\r\n\t- field (class: java.lang.invoke.SerializedLambda, name: capturedArgs, type: class [Ljava.lang.Object;)\r\n\t- object (class java.lang.invoke.SerializedLambda, SerializedLambda[capturingClass=class org.apache.spark.sql.execution.WholeStageCodegenExec, functionalInterfaceMethod=scala/Function2.apply:(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;, implementation=invokeStatic org/apache/spark/sql/execution/WholeStageCodegenExec.$anonfun$doExecute$4$adapted:(Lorg/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/codegen/CodeAndComment;[Ljava/lang/Object;Lorg/apache/spark/sql/execution/metric/SQLMetric;Ljava/lang/Object;Lscala/collection/Iterator;)Lscala/collection/Iterator;, instantiatedMethodType=(Ljava/lang/Object;Lscala/collection/Iterator;)Lscala/collection/Iterator;, numCaptured=3])\r\n\t- writeReplace data (class: java.lang.invoke.SerializedLambda)\r\n\t- object (class org.apache.spark.sql.execution.WholeStageCodegenExec$$Lambda$3123/1641694389, org.apache.spark.sql.execution.WholeStageCodegenExec$$Lambda$3123/1641694389@185db22c)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.serializer.SerializationDebugger$.improveException(SerializationDebugger.scala:41)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.serializer.JavaSerializationStream.writeObject(JavaSerializer.scala:49)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.serializer.JavaSerializerInstance.serialize(JavaSerializer.scala:115)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.util.ClosureCleaner$.ensureSerializable(ClosureCleaner.scala:441)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, a regression in ObjectType expression starting from Spark 3.3.0 is fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nPropagate decommission executor loss reason in K8s during onDisconnect\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently if an executor has been sent a decommission message and then it disconnects from the scheduler we only disable the executor depending on the K8s status events to drive the rest of the state transitions. However, the K8s status events can become overwhelmed on large clusters so we should check if an executor is in a decommissioning state when it is disconnected and use that reason instead of waiting on the K8s status events so we have more accurate logging information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nLogging output will change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd two parameters to allow customizing maxBroadcastTableBytes\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRecently, we encountered some driver OOM problems. Some large tables were compressed using Snappy and then broadcast join was performed, but the actual data volume was too large, which resulted in driver OOM.\r\n\r\nThe values of maxBroadcastTableBytes is hardcoded, 8GB. Maybe we can allow customization of these values, configure smaller values according to different scenarios, and prohibit broadcast joins for some large tables to avoid driver OOM.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

However, the decision was made only considering SQL API, not DataFrame API. In fact, it's very common to chain `Project` operators in DataFrame, e.g. `df.withColumn(...).withColumn(...)...`, and it's very inconvenient if metadata columns are not propagated through `Project`.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes 2 changes:\r\n1. Project should propagate metadata columns\r\n2. SubqueryAlias should only propagate metadata columns if the child is a leaf node or also a SubqueryAlias\r\n\r\nThe second change is needed to still forbid weird queries like `SELECT m from (SELECT a from t)`, which is the main motivation of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32017 .\r\n\r\nAfter propagating metadata columns, a problem from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31666 is exposed: the natural join metadata columns may confuse the analyzer and lead to wrong analyzed plan. For example, `SELECT t1.value FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 USING (key) ORDER BY key`, how shall we resolve `ORDER BY key`? It should be resolved to `t1.key` via the rule `ResolveMissingReferences`, which is in the output of the left join. However, if `Project` can propagate metadata columns, `ORDER BY key` will be resolved to `t2.key`.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, this PR only allows qualified access for metadata columns of natural join. This has no breaking change, as people can only do qualified access for natural join metadata columns before, in the `Project` right after `Join`. This actually enables more use cases, as people can now access natural join metadata columns in ORDER BY. I've added a test for it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  4. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix a regression\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nFor SQL API, there is no change, as a `SubqueryAlias` always comes with a `Project` or `Aggregate`, so we still don't propagate metadata columns through a SELECT group.\r\n\r\nFor DataFrame API, the behavior becomes more lenient. The only breaking case is an operator that can propagate metadata columns then follows a `SubqueryAlias`, e.g. `df.filter(...).as(\"t\").select(\"t.metadata_col\")`. But this is a weird use case and I don't think we should support it at the first place.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

'spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled' is set to true, but has reached the error below and can not continue.

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere is no explicit `hashCode()` function override for `ArrayBasedMapData`. As a result, there is a non-deterministic error where the `hashCode()` computed for `Literal`s of `ArrayBasedMapData` can be different for two equal objects (`Literal`s of `ArrayBasedMapData` with equal keys and values).\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we add a `hashCode` function so that it works exactly as we expect.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is a bug fix for a non-deterministic error. It is also more consistent with the rest of Spark if we implement the `hashCode` method instead of relying on defaults.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nExtend Catalyst's type system by a new decimal type: Decimal128Type with Int128.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark SQL today supports the Decimal data type. The implementation of Spark Decimal holds a BigDecimal or Long value. Spark Decimal provides some operators like +, -, *, /, % and so on. These operators rely heavily on the computational power of BigDecimal or Long itself. For ease of understanding, take the + as an example. The implementation shows below.\r\n```\r\n  def + (that: Decimal): Decimal = {\r\n    if (decimalVal.eq(null) && that.decimalVal.eq(null) && scale == that.scale) {\r\n      Decimal(longVal + that.longVal, Math.max(precision, that.precision) + 1, scale)\r\n    } else {\r\n      Decimal(toBigDecimal.bigDecimal.add(that.toBigDecimal.bigDecimal))\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nWe can see the + of Long will be called if Spark Decimal holds a Long value. Otherwise,  the add of BigDecimal will be called if Spark Decimal holds a BigDecimal value. The other operators of Spark Decimal adopt the similar way. Furthermore, the code shown above calls Decimal.apply to construct a new instance of Spark Decimal.  As we know, the add operator of BigDecimal constructed a new instance of BigDecimal. So, if we call the + operator of Spark Decimal who holds a Long value, Spark will construct a new instance of Decimal. Otherwise, Spark will construct a new instance of BigDecimal and a new instance of Decimal.\r\nThrough rough analysis, we know:\r\n1. The computational power of Spark Decimal may depend on BigDecimal.\r\n2. The calculation operators of Spark Decimal create a lot of new instances of Decimal and may create a lot of new instances of BigDecimal.\r\nIf a large table has a field called 'colA whose type is Spark Decimal, the execution of SUM('colA) will involve the creation of a large number of Spark Decimal instances and BigDecimal instances. These Spark Decimal instances and BigDecimal instances will lead to garbage collection frequently.\r\nInt128 is a high-performance data type about 1X~6X more efficient than BigDecimal for typical operations. It uses a finite (128 bit) precision and can handle up to decimal(38, X). The implementation of Int128 just uses two Long values to represent the high and low bits of 128 bits respectively. Int128 is lighter than BigDecimal, reduces the cost of new() and garbage collection.\r\nIf Spark could support a new type to represent the decimal type with Int128, it would improve the performance for calculation operators.\r\nNow, let's call the new decimal type Decimal128.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, a new decimal type with Int128.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose new functions as aliases for the existing functions:\r\n1. `len()` for `length()`. It exists in [Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/length.html#length-len), [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E41183_01/DR/LEN.html).\r\n2. `curdate()` for `current_date()`. It exists in [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_curdate), [DB2](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.1?topic=functions-curdate).\r\n3. `date_diff()` for `datediff()`. It exists in [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/date_functions#date_diff), [Dremio](https://docs.dremio.com/software/sql-reference/sql-functions/functions/DATE_DIFF/?parent=date-time).\r\n4. `dateadd()` for `date_add()`. It exists in [MS SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/dateadd-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16), [Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/dateadd.html).\r\n5. `datepart()` for `date_part()`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr changes the fabric8 k8s method used in BasicExecutorFeatureStep about setting blockmanager ports. Because It will override port definitions in executor pod template file.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe use spark.kubernetes.executor.podTemplateFile to specify executor pod definition. However, we cannot set port definition to pod. For example, this is my executorPodTemplate.yaml \r\n```\r\napiversion: v1\r\nkind: Pod\r\nspec:\r\n  containers:\r\n    - name: spark-kubernetes-executor\r\n      ports:\r\n        - containerPort: 8090\r\n          name: jmx-exporter\r\n          protocol: TCP\r\n```\r\nWhen executors start, the pod definitions only show default blockmanager port.\r\n```\r\n      ports:\r\n        - containerPort: 7079\r\n          name: blockmanager\r\n          protocol: TCP\r\n```\r\nIt looks like a bug, because the BasicExecutorFeatureStep uses withPorts to override all port definitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd unit test\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-05T10:59:28Z","updated_at":"2022-09-10T03:10:17Z","closed_at":"2022-09-08T17:54:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bf166e3a6303cd3111b9b188063acb74e86c2065","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37803/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37803/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37803/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/803452bc5151b5df1718c00ce9a19a10b050479e","head":{"label":"fanyilun:executor-ports","ref":"executor-ports","sha":"803452bc5151b5df1718c00ce9a19a10b050479e","user":{"login":"fanyilun","id":11242745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjQyNzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11242745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun","html_url":"https://github.com/fanyilun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":532804806,"node_id":"R_kgDOH8H0xg","name":"spark","full_name":"fanyilun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fanyilun","id":11242745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjQyNzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11242745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun","html_url":"https://github.com/fanyilun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fanyilun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fanyilun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR suggests using Java 11/17 as runtime of Spark in the `index.md`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe JIT optimizer in Java 11/17 is better than Java 8, running Spark using Java 11/17 will bring some performance benefits.\r\n\r\nSpark uses `Whole Stage Code Gen` to improve performance, but the generated code may not be friendly to the JIT optimizer. For example, the case mentioned in SPARK-40303 by @wangyum :\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  runBenchmark(\"Benchmark count distinct\") {\r\n    withTempPath { dir =>\r\n      val N = 2000000\r\n      val columns = Range(0, 100).map(i => s\"id % $i AS id$i\")\r\n\r\n      spark.range(N).selectExpr(columns: _*).write.mode(\"Overwrite\").parquet(dir.getCanonicalPath)\r\n\r\n      Seq(1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100).foreach { cnt =>\r\n        val selectExps = columns.take(cnt).map(_.split(\" \").last).map(c => s\"count(distinct $c)\")\r\n\r\n        val benchmark = new Benchmark(\"Benchmark count distinct\", N, minNumIters = 1)\r\n        benchmark.addCase(s\"$cnt count distinct with codegen\") { _ =>\r\n          withSQLConf(\r\n            \"spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage\" -> \"true\",\r\n            \"spark.sql.codegen.factoryMode\" -> \"FALLBACK\") {\r\n            spark.read.parquet(dir.getCanonicalPath).selectExpr(selectExps: _*)\r\n              .write.format(\"noop\").mode(\"Overwrite\").save()\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        benchmark.addCase(s\"$cnt count distinct without codegen\") { _ =>\r\n          withSQLConf(\r\n            \"spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage\" -> \"false\",\r\n            \"spark.sql.codegen.factoryMode\" -> \"NO_CODEGEN\") {\r\n            spark.read.parquet(dir.getCanonicalPath).selectExpr(selectExps: _*)\r\n              .write.format(\"noop\").mode(\"Overwrite\").save()\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n        benchmark.run()\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen use Java 8 to run the above case in `local[2]` mode, there will be obvious negative effects when `cnt` is **35, 40, 50, 60 or 70**  with `codegen` enabled. (the performance after `cnt > 70` is meet expectations due to fallback with InternalCompilerException: Code grows beyond 64 KB):\r\n\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_345-b01 on Linux

compiler:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCOMPILE SKIPPED: unsupported incoming calling sequence\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\nCOMPILE SKIPPED: unsupported calling sequence\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using Java 8, they are identified as `not retryable`, this indicates that the compiler deemed this method should not be attempted to compile again on any tier of compilation, and because this is an OSR compilation (i.e. loop compilation), this will mark the method as \"never try to perform OSR compilation again on all tiers\".  But when using Java 11/17 they are identified as `retry at different tier`,  it'll try tier 1, this also makes the performance of the above cases seem acceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo this pr started to suggest using Java 11/17 as runtime environment of Spark in the document.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nJust change the document.\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-05T06:12:48Z","updated_at":"2022-09-22T01:06:35Z","closed_at":"2022-09-11T13:41:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"28e3d724cfd55089bf1d6cbdd2e2372cf95b0234","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37799/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37799/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37799/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/60ae7ab71e19cb86f25bbde8d1a04f14886a5587","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-40331","ref":"SPARK-40331","sha":"60ae7ab71e19cb86f25bbde8d1a04f14886a5587","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend `ParseException` and add new field `queryContext` which contains an array of query contexts. By default, the field is initialized by the context of currently processed tree node.\r\n\r\nAlso I removed the wrapper `validateParsingError()` of `checkError()` to use last one directly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL by providing more context of parsing errors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, it extends existing functionality.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *QueryParsingErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBefore when the Executor plugin fails to initialize for fatal error, the Executor shows active in sparkUI but does not accept any job. As expected Executor should exit when initialization failed with fatal error. \r\nThe root cause:  The thread pool execution uses the inappropriate API `submit` instead of `execute`. This leads to  `SparkUncaughtExceptionHandler` can't catch the fatal error.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs expected Executor should exit when initialization failed with fatal error.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIntroduce `sql_conf` context manager for `pyspark.sql`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThat simplifies the control of Spark SQL configuration as below\r\n\r\nfrom\r\n```py\r\noriginal_value = spark.conf.get(\"key\")\r\nspark.conf.set(\"key\", \"value\")\r\n...\r\nspark.conf.set(\"key\", original_value)\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```py\r\nwith sql_conf({\"key\": \"value\"}):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n[Here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/pyspark/pandas/utils.py#L490) is such a context manager is in Pandas API on Spark.\r\n\r\nWe should introduce one in `pyspark.sql`, and deduplicate code if possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Users may use the context manager to manage the Spark SQL configuration for a code block.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n```py\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.utils import sql_conf\r\n>>> with sql_conf({\"spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled\": True}):\r\n...    pdf = sdf.toPandas()\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose:\r\n1. Output errors in the PRETTY format in the same way as before the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37520.\r\n2. Do not output non-JSON elements in the MINIMAL and STANDARD formats.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To not break existing apps that might expect text errors in particular format.\r\n3. Do not output extra text when the Thrift Server outputs errors in an JSON format.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere is no explicit `hashCode()` function override for the `ArrayBasedMapData` LogicalPlan. As a result, there is a non-deterministic error where the `hashCode()` computed for `ArrayBasedMapData` can be different for two equal objects (objects with equal keys and values).\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we override the `hashCode` function so that it works exactly as we expect. We also have an explicit `equals()` function for consistency with how `Literal`s check for equality of `ArrayBasedMapData`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is a bug fix for a non-deterministic error. It is also more consistent with the rest of Spark if we implement the `hashCode` and `equals` methods instead of relying on defaults.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nA simple unit test was added.","created_at":"2022-09-02T12:38:23Z","updated_at":"2024-02-12T18:49:49Z","closed_at":"2022-09-06T10:21:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"678d8c4f495dc0ea1eb3d46288ad86baeae34cd4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37771/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37771/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37771/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/02a55323aa4640c80c51a39d556ee3d46e48ee52","head":{"label":"c27kwan:SPARK-40315","ref":"SPARK-40315","sha":"02a55323aa4640c80c51a39d556ee3d46e48ee52","user":{"login":"c27kwan","id":20251669,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjUxNjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20251669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan","html_url":"https://github.com/c27kwan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":531875231,"node_id":"R_kgDOH7PFnw","name":"spark","full_name":"c27kwan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c27kwan","id":20251669,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjUxNjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20251669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan","html_url":"https://github.com/c27kwan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c27kwan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c27kwan/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdds Scala and Python bindings for SQL functions inline and inline_outer\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently these functions can only be used via SQL or through `expr` functions. This makes it a little easier to use them with the DataFrame APIs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nExposes new functions directly instead of only through SQL.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing inline tests to use the new Scala binding instead of being called through SQL

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRemove the check for foldable delimiter arguments from `StringToMap#checkInputDataTypes`.\r\n\r\nExcept for `checkInputDataTypes`, `StringToMap` is already able to handle non-foldable delimiter arguments (no other changes are required).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nHive 2.3.9 allows non-foldable delimiter arguments, e.g.:\r\n```\r\ndrop table if exists maptbl;\r\ncreate table maptbl as select ',' as del1, ':' as del2, 'a:1,b:2,c:3' as str;\r\ninsert into table maptbl select '%' as del1, '-' as del2, 'a-1%b-2%c-3' as str;\r\nselect str, str_to_map(str, del1, del2) from maptbl;\r\n```\r\nThis returns\r\n```\r\n+--------------+----------------------------+\r\n|     str      |            _c1             |\r\n+--------------+----------------------------+\r\n| a:1,b:2,c:3  | {\"a\":\"1\",\"b\":\"2\",\"c\":\"3\"}  |\r\n| a-1%b-2%c-3  | {\"a\":\"1\",\"b\":\"2\",\"c\":\"3\"}  |\r\n+--------------+----------------------------+\r\n2 rows selected (0.13 seconds)\r\n```\r\nHowever, Spark returns an error:\r\n```\r\nstr_to_map's delimiters must be foldable.; line 1 pos 12;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe use-case is more likely to be something like this:\r\n```\r\nselect\r\n  str,\r\n  str_to_map(str, ',', if(region = 0, ':', '#')) as m\r\nfrom\r\n  maptbl2;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users can now specify non-foldable delimiter arguments to `str_to_map`.\r\n\r\nLiterals are still accepted, so the change is backwardly compatible.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-01T22:34:45Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T18:25:01Z","closed_at":"2022-09-03T20:05:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e8344745fe46a334ae706aad2ad7c8bf0c0a3b19","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37763/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37763/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37763/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/da92fa0aa18e6e48f93b686e4a4e52bf83488b55","head":{"label":"bersprockets:str_to_map_play","ref":"str_to_map_play","sha":"da92fa0aa18e6e48f93b686e4a4e52bf83488b55","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change adds an ability for code to rename multiple columns in a single call. \r\n**Scala:**\r\n```scala\r\nwithColumnsRenamed(colsMap: Map[String, String]): DataFrame\r\n```\r\n**Java:**\r\n```java\r\nwithColumnsRenamed(colsMap: java.util.Map[String, String]): DataFrame\r\n```\r\n**Python:**\r\n```python\r\nwithColumnsRenamed(self, *colsMap: Dict[str, Column]) -> \"DataFrame\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe have seen that catalyst optimiser struggles with bigger plans. The larger contribution to these plans in our setup comes from `withColumnRenamed`, `drop` and `withColumn` being called in for loop by unknowing users. `master` branch of spark already has a version for handling `withColumns` and `drop` for multiple columns. The missing bit of the puzzle is `withColumnRenamed`.\r\n\r\nWith large amount of columns, either JVM gets killed or StackOverflowError occurs. I am skipping those for the following benchmark and focus on number of columns which work in both old and new implementation. Following example shows the performance impact with 100 columns.:\r\n**Old fashioned with 100 columns**\r\n```python\r\nimport datetime\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nnum_rows = 2\r\nnum_columns = 100\r\ndata = np.zeros((num_rows, num_columns))\r\ncolumns = map(str, range(num_columns))\r\nraw = spark.createDataFrame(pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns))\r\n\r\na = datetime.datetime.now()\r\n\r\nfor col in raw.columns:\r\n    raw = raw.withColumnRenamed(col, f\"prefix_{col}\")\r\n\r\nb = datetime.datetime.now()\r\nfor col in raw.columns:\r\n    raw = raw.withColumnRenamed(col, f\"prefix_{col}\")\r\n\r\nc = datetime.datetime.now()\r\nfor col in raw.columns:\r\n    raw = raw.withColumnRenamed(col, f\"prefix_{col}\")\r\n\r\nd = datetime.datetime.now()\r\nfor col in raw.columns:\r\n    raw = raw.withColumnRenamed(col, f\"prefix_{col}\")\r\n\r\ne = datetime.datetime.now()\r\nfor col in raw.columns:\r\n    raw = raw.withColumnRenamed(col, f\"prefix_{col}\")\r\n\r\nf = datetime.datetime.now()\r\nfor col in raw.columns:\r\n    raw = raw.withColumnRenamed(col, f\"prefix_{col}\")\r\n\r\ng = datetime.datetime.now()\r\ng-a\r\ndatetime.timedelta(seconds=12, microseconds=480021)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**New implementation with 100 columns**\r\n```python\r\nimport datetime\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nnum_rows = 2\r\nnum_columns = 100\r\ndata = np.zeros((num_rows, num_columns))\r\ncolumns = map(str, range(num_columns))\r\nraw = spark.createDataFrame(pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns))\r\n\r\na = datetime.datetime.now()\r\nraw = raw.withColumnsRenamed({col: f\"prefix_{col}\" for col in raw.columns})\r\nb = datetime.datetime.now()\r\nraw = raw.withColumnsRenamed({col: f\"prefix_{col}\" for col in raw.columns})\r\nc = datetime.datetime.now()\r\nraw = raw.withColumnsRenamed({col: f\"prefix_{col}\" for col in raw.columns})\r\nd = datetime.datetime.now()\r\nraw = raw.withColumnsRenamed({col: f\"prefix_{col}\" for col in raw.columns})\r\ne = datetime.datetime.now()\r\nraw = raw.withColumnsRenamed({col: f\"prefix_{col}\" for col in raw.columns})\r\nf = datetime.datetime.now()\r\nraw = raw.withColumnsRenamed({col: f\"prefix_{col}\" for col in raw.columns})\r\ng =

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport more than Integer.MAX_VALUE of the same join key.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor SMJ, the number of the same join key records of the right table is greater than Integer.MAX_VALUE, the result will be incorrect.\r\nBefore SMJ JOIN, we will put the records of the same join key into the ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray. ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray.numRows overflow may cause OOM. During SMJ JOIN, SpillableArrayIterator.startIndex overflow may cause incorrect result.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual test.\r\n\r\nA simple UT\r\n\r\n```\r\n  test(\"join with too many duplicate key\") {\r\n    withSQLConf(SQLConf.AUTO_BROADCASTJOIN_THRESHOLD.key -> \"-1\") {\r\n      val duplicateKeyNumber = Integer.MAX_VALUE + 2\r\n      val df1 = Seq(1).toDF(\"id\")\r\n      val df2 =\r\n        spark.range(1, duplicateKeyNumber, 1, 1000).map(_ => 1).toDF(\"id\")\r\n      df1.join(df2, Seq(\"id\"), \"inner\").collect()\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nFor this SMJ, the SortMergeJoinScanner will append all `id=1` rows into a `ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray`. After appending `Integer.MAX_VALUE` rows,  `ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray.numRows` will be

However, the decision was made only considering SQL API, not DataFrame API. In fact, it's very common to chain `Project` operators in DataFrame, e.g. `df.withColumn(...).withColumn(...)...`, and it's very inconvenient if metadata columns are not propagated through `Project`.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes 2 changes:\r\n1. Project should propagate metadata columns\r\n2. SubqueryAlias should only propagate metadata columns if the child is a leaf node or also a SubqueryAlias\r\n\r\nThe second change is needed to still forbid weird queries like `SELECT m from (SELECT a from t)`, which is the main motivation of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32017 .\r\n\r\nAfter propagating metadata columns, a problem from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31666 is exposed: the natural join metadata columns may confuse the analyzer and lead to wrong analyzed plan. For example, `SELECT t1.value FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 USING (key) ORDER BY key`, how shall we resolve `ORDER BY key`? It should be resolved to `t1.key` via the rule `ResolveMissingReferences`, which is in the output of the left join. However, if `Project` can propagate metadata columns, `ORDER BY key` will be resolved to `t2.key`.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, this PR only allows qualified access for metadata columns of natural join. This has no breaking change, as people can only do qualified access for natural join metadata columns before, in the `Project` right after `Join`. This actually enables more use cases, as people can now access natural join metadata columns in ORDER BY. I've added a test for it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  4. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix a regression\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nFor SQL API, there is no change, as a `SubqueryAlias` always comes with a `Project` or `Aggregate`, so we still don't propagate metadata columns through a SELECT group.\r\n\r\nFor DataFrame API, the behavior becomes more lenient. The only breaking case is an operator that can propagate metadata columns then follows a `SubqueryAlias`, e.g. `df.filter(...).as(\"t\").select(\"t.metadata_col\")`. But this is a weird use case and I don't think we should support it at the first place.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

Add `YuniKornSuite` integration test suite which extends `KubernetesSuite` on Apache YuniKorn scheduler.\r\n2.

user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a test suite addition.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSince this requires `Apache YuniKorn` installation, the test suite is disabled by default. \r\nSo, CI K8s integration test should pass without running this suite.\r\n\r\nIn order to run the tests, we need to override `test.default.exclude.tags` like the following.\r\n\r\n**SBT**\r\n```\r\n$

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes a bug where a CTE reference cannot be resolved if this reference occurs in an inner CTE definition nested in the outer CTE's main body FROM clause. E.g.,\r\n```\r\nWITH cte_outer AS (\r\n  SELECT 1\r\n)\r\nSELECT * FROM (\r\n  WITH cte_inner AS (\r\n    SELECT * FROM cte_outer\r\n  )\r\n  SELECT * FROM cte_inner\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fix is to change the `CTESubstitution`'s traverse order from `resolveOperatorsUpWithPruning` to `resolveOperatorsDownWithPruning` and also to recursively call `traverseAndSubstituteCTE` for CTE main body.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix. Without the fix an `AnalysisException` would be thrown for CTE queries mentioned above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen users have a query like `SELECT SUM(a), DISTINCT(a, b) FROM table`, the DISTINCT is treated as a function but cannot be found with the following message:\r\n```\r\nUndefined function: distinct. This function is neither a built-in/temporary function, nor a persistent function that is qualified as hive_metastore.default.distinct\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can standardize this error message for the case of distinct as users might want to use distinct to deduplicate arguments but thought it is an aggregation functions.  The new error message should remind proper actions for fix distinct syntax issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.
