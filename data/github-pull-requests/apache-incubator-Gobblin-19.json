Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-415\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGobblinServiceJobScheduler checks for the existence of the Config Key \"flow.runImmediately\" instead of its boolean value in deciding whether to schedule a flow for execution. We need to modify this behavior to check for the actual value of the config key provided in the job config.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  Change is trivial and ran clean build with unit tests. Also tested the change in local set up by restarting gobblin-service.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-408\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAdd timings for kafka fetch, record reading, record conversion, elapsed time.\r\nAdd processed count and kafka production count since the last batch. This helps determine whether the production rate is greater than the consumption rate.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested with a gobblin-kafka test flow and ran a report on the generated events.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

job output path for full snapshot\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below! @htran1 please review.\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-407\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIf the property 'extract.is.full' is set to true, job output should be written to _full directories. This stopped happening since changes in https://github.com/apache/incubator-gobblin/commit/df75b13e1f7ee5776ed18b7aade9014fae8deeea were pushed in, because it made it to ignore this property by not including it while creating 'Extract'.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I moved the logic of finding output directory name from Extract to WorkUnitState, as Extract:getIsFull() is marked as deprecated.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntest case already present\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-98\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n        The Hive's OrcSerde caches converted records - the OrcSerde has a single \r\n        org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcSerde.OrcSerdeRow (basically an ArrayList) and every \r\n        time the org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.Serializer#serialize(Object, ObjectInspector) method \r\n        is called, the object is re-used.\r\n        The problem is that org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcSerde.OrcSerdeRow is package \r\n        protected and has no public constructor, so no copy can be made. This would be fine if \r\n        org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcSerde.OrcSerdeRow is immediately written out. But all \r\n        Gobblin jobs have a buffer that the writer reads from. This buffering can cause race conditions \r\n        where records get dropped and duplicated.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n    - gobblin-core/src/test/java/gobblin/serde/HiveSerDeTest.java\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-98\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n  The Hive's OrcSerde caches converted records - the OrcSerde has a single org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcSerde.OrcSerdeRow (basically an ArrayList) and every time the org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.Serializer#serialize(Object, ObjectInspector) method is called, the object is re-used.\r\n  The problem is that org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcSerde.OrcSerdeRow is package protected and has no public constructor, so no copy can be made. This would be fine if org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcSerde.OrcSerdeRow is immediately written out. But all Gobblin jobs have a buffer that the writer reads from. This buffering can cause race conditions where records get dropped and duplicated.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n\t- gobblin-core/src/test/java/gobblin/serde/HiveSerDeTest.java\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

resources\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-405\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThere are race conditions in the retrieval of immediately invalidate resources from the SharedResourcesBroker. This can result in an object being returned multiple times even though it should only be returned once. It can also result in valid objects being invalidated before a thread picks it up and it can also result in stack overflow due to a thread starving and retrying many times.\r\n\r\nThe fix introduces ResourceEntry#getResourceIfValid() to atomically get the resource if it is valid. A null is returned for invalid objects. The recursion in DefaultBrokerCache#getScoped() was replaced with iteration to avoid stack overflow and a lock was added to minimize retries.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-401\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen CombineSelectionPolicy is used as a selection policy class with ConfigBasedDatasetFinder, there is no constructor with appropriate signature for instantiation from ReplicationValidPathPicker class and we get an exception like the following:\r\n\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: No such accessible constructor on object: org.apache.gobblin.data.management.policy.CombineSelectionPolicy\r\n\r\nWe need to provide a constructor for CombineSelectionPolicy with only the selection config as an argument. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNot applicable.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-398\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThere are many performance and correctness fixes in helix 0.6.9. 0.6.9 and has the option for dynamically rebalancing assigned tasks. This allows us to remove the GobblinJobRebalancer that was used for dynamic task rebalancing.\r\n\r\nThe job cleanup code no longer works with 0.6.9, so it was replaced with a call to delete the workflow asynchronously. Tests were updated accordingly. If a new job instance of the job is submitted before the queue for that job has been deleted then the submission will wait for the queue to be removed before creating a new queue with the same name.\r\n\r\nThe version of dropwizard metrics was bumped to 3.2.3 due to Helix 0.6.9 requiring the SlidingTimeWindowArrayReservoir class.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-392\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe MySqlDatasetStateStore and ZkDatasetStateStore have a bug where getLatestDatasetStatesByUrns() only returns one dataset state instead of all of them. Fix getLatestDatasetStatesByUrns() to return all dataset states retrieved from the underlying state store.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-384\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nDefault python points to < Openssl v1.0 on Mac, and is a hassle to upgrade. Whereas Jira servers have started blocking any call with older SSL versions. \r\n\r\nAn alternate that requires little work for all environments but helps is to bump up the python version to python3. This can installed via brew on Mac along with newer Openssl. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested locally\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-381\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis is related to GOBBLIN-368. ConfigBasedDatasets do not have the ability to apply path filters to directories. Similar to RecursiveCopyableDataset, ConfigBasedDatasets should filter files and/or directories based on the following configuration keys:\r\n\r\ngobblin.copy.applyFilterToDirectories\r\n\r\ngobblin.dataset.path.filter.class\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n    - Enhanced ConfigBasedDatasetTest class to test HiddenFilters and their application to directories (in addition to filenames).\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below! @ibuenros Kindly review this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-379\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen the resource requirements imposed by a distcp dataset exceed those specified by properties gobblin.copy.prioritization.maxCopy.copyEntities & gobblin.copy.prioritization.maxCopy.size (default: 20000 and 10TB respectively), the dataset is skipped with a WARN message in the log.  In a production setting, this will not suffice and it would be nice to submit an event to Kafka for downstream processing and alerting.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n        - Added a test method to CopySourceTest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-19T01:36:09Z","updated_at":"2018-02-08T19:37:25Z","closed_at":"2018-02-08T19:37:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2eae644a56e0dc4833922a1c1452532f22e1e1a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2257/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2257/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2257/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/be19c43a75e796f7d5d3cee2818edaf1918c51ab","head":{"label":"sv2000:gobblin-379","ref":"gobblin-379","sha":"be19c43a75e796f7d5d3cee2818edaf1918c51ab","user":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110619744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTA2MTk3NDQ=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"sv2000/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-379\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n    - When the resource requirements imposed by a distcp dataset exceed those specified by properties gobblin.copy.prioritization.maxCopy.copyEntities & gobblin.copy.prioritization.maxCopy.size (default: 20000 and 10TB respectively), the dataset is skipped with a WARN message in the log.  In a production setting, this will not suffice and it would be nice to submit an event to Kafka for downstream processing and alerting. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- N/A\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-19T00:25:32Z","updated_at":"2018-01-19T01:31:18Z","closed_at":"2018-01-19T01:31:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7a908294324ffec6d67d47f2f8d633a355648424","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2255/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2255/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2255/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/1a3e63e97c6d425f739c2bb44d4cd4243126689c","head":{"label":"sv2000:gobblin_379","ref":"gobblin_379","sha":"1a3e63e97c6d425f739c2bb44d4cd4243126689c","user":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110619744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTA2MTk3NDQ=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"sv2000/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-380\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n  - Logs are added for `QuartzJobSpecScheduler` and  `StandardGobblinInstanceDriver`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - Only log statements are added or modified\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-19T00:12:41Z","updated_at":"2018-01-23T18:24:48Z","closed_at":"2018-01-23T01:01:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"80a82409d5b15950576208d23724bb21457df73d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2254/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2254/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2254/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/3fab82c36e039914ea59ab5307e707c1ca211cd1","head":{"label":"zxcware:msg","ref":"msg","sha":"3fab82c36e039914ea59ab5307e707c1ca211cd1","user":{"login":"zxcware","id":2355051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2355051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware","html_url":"https://github.com/zxcware","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77711189,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzcxMTE4OQ==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"zxcware/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zxcware","id":2355051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2355051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware","html_url":"https://github.com/zxcware","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zxcware/gobblin","description":"Universal

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-372\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nHelix incorrectly deletes using a prefix match, so when \"workflow1\" is deleted other workflows such as \"workflow12\" and \"workflow100\" are deleted. This fix copies the `setSingleWorkflowTargetState()` and associated methods from the `TaskDriver` into the `GobblinHelixTaskDriver` and calls it directly to avoid the prefix scan.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below! @abti please review\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-370\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis PR address two issues with logging :\r\n1) When event reporter fails, it does not log all the information, because syntax was wrong. It is corrected in the PR.\r\n2) When a task fails, it stores the failure exception (Task.java#failtask()) , but we do not use it to log. This PR will log that exception too.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: not required it is just log improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-12T23:16:22Z","updated_at":"2020-06-02T17:57:02Z","closed_at":"2018-02-05T19:56:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"55bad8a57c57ccdf7dba2f31d5a40d334bf97846","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2245/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2245/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2245/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/176b3b495d0ff0abcf9f68c12772589ac51d7ac4","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:enhanceLogging","ref":"enhanceLogging","sha":"176b3b495d0ff0abcf9f68c12772589ac51d7ac4","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-364\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n  - `PartitionedFileSourceBase` source has a copy of the entire job configurations. For the following 2 reasons, we want to exclude job configurations from `WorkUnit`:\r\n    - It's redundant as the runtime counterpart of `WorkUnit`, which is `WorkUnitState`, would have a reference to all job configurations.\r\n    - Adding job configurations to `WorkUnit` has the bad side effect of masking dynamic job level configurations in MR Task runner\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n  - `DatePartitionedAvroFileExtractorTest#testJobStateNotCopiedToWorkUnit`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-363\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe task state files are removed in the driver after they are deserialized, but the job-level directory such as _taskstates/job_1_1112 is not removed. This results in many empty directories in the _taskstates directory.\r\n\r\nThis fix removes the job-level subdirectory after the execution of the job.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-09T19:45:44Z","updated_at":"2018-01-09T21:56:56Z","closed_at":"2018-01-09T21:56:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"80bfd299454019c78bcb937b2221c7d392cfcc57","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2234/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2234/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2234/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/f9300edd41d32e736443555be99ad568f05c393e","head":{"label":"htran1:cluster_task_state_cleanup","ref":"cluster_task_state_cleanup","sha":"f9300edd41d32e736443555be99ad568f05c393e","user":{"login":"htran1","id":23297947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjk3OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23297947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1","html_url":"https://github.com/htran1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":73107999,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MzEwNzk5OQ==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"htran1/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"htran1","id":23297947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjk3OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23297947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1","html_url":"https://github.com/htran1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/htran1/gobblin","description":"Universal

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-353\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n  - When the histogram has size 1, `generateSpecifiedPartitions` in SalesforceSource will generate a single point partition list if `interval` is smaller than the total count. And the point in the list, which originally is the low watermark, will be replaced by high watermark.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n  - `SalesforceSourceTest#testGenerateSpecifiedPartitionFromSinglePointHistogram`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-344\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n  - In the PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-gobblin/pull/2187, I mistakenly made help method `LineageInfo#getResolver` private. It should be `public`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - No logic change at all\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-12T02:19:30Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T19:38:14Z","closed_at":"2017-12-12T02:56:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"09a355e90d8c1d4cb392dd18b568168b46d76c44","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2200/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2200/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2200/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/c902dd12c8506fd4fca0c4fcbac8a4447aa4a77f","head":{"label":"zxcware:line","ref":"line","sha":"c902dd12c8506fd4fca0c4fcbac8a4447aa4a77f","user":{"login":"zxcware","id":2355051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2355051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware","html_url":"https://github.com/zxcware","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77711189,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzcxMTE4OQ==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"zxcware/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zxcware","id":2355051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2355051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware","html_url":"https://github.com/zxcware","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxcware/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zxcware/gobblin","description":"Universal
