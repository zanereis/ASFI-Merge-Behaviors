you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nExecute job asynchronously is supported in Java StreamExecutionEnvironment, we should also support it in Python StreamExecutionEnvironment.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add execute_async() for StreamExecutionEnvironment.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change has test case covered by test_execute_async() in test_stream_execution_environment().\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? ( no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Support serialization for canal-json format*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - add SerializationSchema for serialize data to byte[]\r\n  - add formatfactory for

You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, the native K8s integration does not using the existing script(e.g. jobmanager.sh, taskmanager.sh) to start JobManager and TaskManager. Instead, the java start command is generate by Flink internally(i.e. `KubernetesClusterDescriptor`, `KubernetesResourceManager`).\r\n\r\nIn this PR https://github.com/apache/flink-docker/pull/37, we have integrated the functionality of `kubernetes-entry.sh` to the unified `docker-entrypoint.sh`.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to remove the `kubernetes-entry.sh` completely.\r\n\r\n**How to enable the plugin after this PR?**\r\n```\r\nflink run-application -t kubernetes-application -Dkubernetes.cluster-id=k8s-ha-app1 ...\r\n-Dcontainerized.master.env.ENABLE_BUILT_IN_PLUGINS=flink-oss-fs-hadoop-1.11.1.jar \\\r\n-Dcontainerized.taskmanager.env.ENABLE_BUILT_IN_PLUGINS=flink-oss-fs-hadoop-1.11.1.jar \\\r\nlocal:///opt/flink/examples/streaming/StateMachineExample.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Replace kubernetes-entry.sh with unified docker-entrypoint.sh\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* This PR is covered by existing unit tests(some tests need to be updated).\r\n* The E2E tests(`test_kubernetes_session.sh, `test_kubernetes_application.sh`) should pass without modification.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / **don't** know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd partitioning interfaces for Python DataStream API so that users can configure the partitioning strategy of DataStream.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add union()/project()/broadcast()/rebalance()/rescale()/shuffle() interfaces for Python DataStream API.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change has test cases covered in test_data_stream.py\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (/ no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd read_text_file() and print() interface for Python DataStream API. It would be of benefit for ease of use and debug purpose. Further more, Users can play with Flink out of box through these simple source/sink API.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add print() for Python DataStream API.\r\n- Add read_text_file for StreamExecutionEnvironment to get a DataStream.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change has test cases covered by test_print() in test_data_stream.py and test_read_text_file() in test_stream_execution_environment.py\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-11T09:10:33Z","updated_at":"2020-08-12T02:03:52Z","closed_at":"2020-08-12T02:03:30Z","merged_at":"2020-08-12T02:03:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"37d7917bc175026cc09f4842f38fea6b0cc818cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273030665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDMwNjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Python","name":"component=API/Python","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13117/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13117/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13117/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/253c7f3594daaff158043874bbe4401ff9ad0e81","head":{"label":"shuiqiangchen:FLINK-18863-print","ref":"FLINK-18863-print","sha":"253c7f3594daaff158043874bbe4401ff9ad0e81","user":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":157520857,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTc1MjA4NTc=","name":"flink","full_name":"shuiqiangchen/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis change is part of many that will translate `*.zh.md` docs for Python Table API to Chinese Simplified. Untranslated paragraphs currently in ```*-zh.md``` will be replaced with Chinese translations. Translation will be done with ```Google Translate``` and manual corrections. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nTranslate files:\r\n - Translate docs/dev/table/python/conversion_of_pandas.zh.md\r\n - Translate docs/dev/table/python/metrics.zh.md\r\n - Translate docs/dev/table/python/python_types.zh.md\r\n - Translate docs/dev/table/python/vectorized_python_udfs.zh.md\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as document build test (if exists). \r\n\r\nNOTE: some files are translated from `*.md` and others from `*.zh.md`. Please verify that the translated text contains the latest changes, even if this commit is based on updated `*.md` or `*.zh.md` files. \r\n\r\nNOTE: custom headers should be checked for compatibility and are not applied every where. \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no \r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? N/A

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis change is part of many that will translate `*.zh.md` docs for Python Table API to Chinese Simplified. Untranslated paragraphs currently in ```*-zh.md``` will be replaced with Chinese translations. Translation will be done with ```Google Translate``` and manual corrections. Note that commits should be squashed. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nTranslate files:\r\n - Improve docs/dev/table/python/common_questions.zh.md\r\n - Translate docs/dev/table/python/index.zh.md\r\n - Translate docs/dev/table/python/python_udfs.zh.md \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as document build test (if exists). \r\n\r\nNOTE: some files are translated from `*.md` and others from `*.zh.md`.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix of FLINK-18821 for FLINK-1.11 release (similar to #13067 for 1.12).\r\n\r\nCurrently, an exception in `PartitionRequestClientFactory` is propagated to the client directly. \r\nThe future in the internal `PartitionRequestClientFactory` map is not completed exceptionally.\r\nThis causes subsequent calls to wait indefinitely for the future to complete (see FLINK-18821).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by completing the future exceptionally in case of error.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded unit test: `PartitionRequestClientFactoryTest.testFailureReportedToSubsequentRequests`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport getting a Table from a DataStream, and converting a Table into DataStream.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- add from_data_stream()/ to_append_stream()/to_retract_stream() interface for StreamTableEnvironment.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change has test case covered by test_from_data_stream() / test_to_append_stream()/ test_to_retract_stream() in test_table_environment_api.py.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-10T12:51:47Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T06:00:54Z","closed_at":"2020-08-11T06:00:54Z","merged_at":"2020-08-11T06:00:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"8b9193a737e9f32ecad1f0da7c30b734d8990b5f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273030665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDMwNjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Python","name":"component=API/Python","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13107/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13107/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13107/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/76ffb2e9aa892213380aeb81db6ced81f6c2ab2a","head":{"label":"shuiqiangchen:FLINK-18874-to-table","ref":"FLINK-18874-to-table","sha":"76ffb2e9aa892213380aeb81db6ced81f6c2ab2a","user":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":157520857,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTc1MjA4NTc=","name":"flink","full_name":"shuiqiangchen/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUpdates all built-in aggregate functions to the new type system. The functions extend from `InternalAggregateFunction` for easier translation but can also be used as external functions (e.g. for testing). \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduce `InternalAggregateFunction`\r\n- Update all functions including `DISTINCT`\r\n- Fix various issues around types and their data structures\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as `AggregateITCase` or tests that extend from `AggFunctionTestBase`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen using LISTAGG with retraction, the result type of LISTAGG is not correctly inferred. The result type should be STRING, but is RAW type, because we didn't override `ListAggWithRetractAggFunction#getResultType`. This is mainly caused by FLINK-16996, because we automantically inferred the BinaryStringTypeInfo with BinaryStringTypeInfoFactory.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- override `getResultType`  and `getAccumulatorType` for  `ListAggWithRetractAggFunction` and `ListAggWsWithRetractAggFunction` returning StringData type info. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- added `testListAggWithRetraction` integration tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-10T08:55:21Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T02:08:05Z","closed_at":"2020-08-11T02:08:01Z","merged_at":"2020-08-11T02:08:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"bfbdca9f574b4201ba7a400607c5169134ecf0a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1291537903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkxNTM3OTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Runtime","name":"component=TableSQL/Runtime","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13104/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13104/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13104/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f55edc75aa3296ed9a20aa3f5c45a975407d0d59","head":{"label":"wuchong:fix-listagg","ref":"fix-listagg","sha":"f55edc75aa3296ed9a20aa3f5c45a975407d0d59","user":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63797485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Mzc5NzQ4NQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"wuchong/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove the logic for blocking shipping simple files to the yarn cluster. (Previously we only supported directories for some reason)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added a new test case to FlinkYarnSessionCliTest*\r\n \r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: yes\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not documented\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-10T08:45:24Z","updated_at":"2020-08-18T07:44:56Z","closed_at":"2020-08-18T07:44:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d5a3e8e61b3becbe9205bb021d0ed9333ebfd894","assignee":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272992926,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/YARN","name":"component=Deployment/YARN","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13103/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13103/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13103/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/daace746051c9b64a2d8c0a722616eaec54fd1ce","head":{"label":"gyfora:FLINK-18752","ref":"FLINK-18752","sha":"daace746051c9b64a2d8c0a722616eaec54fd1ce","user":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35147510,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTE0NzUxMA==","name":"flink","full_name":"gyfora/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdding `FanOutRecordPublisher`, a new implementation of `RecordPublisher` to add support for Enhanced Fan Out (EFO) from Kinesis Streams using the `FlinkKinesisConsumer`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- `FanOutRecordPublisher`\r\n  - Consumes records from Kinesis using EFO via `KinesisV2Proxy`\r\n  - `FanOutShardSubscriber` used to split consumption and consumer processing and error handling\r\n- `ShardConsumer`\r\n  - Starting position from `LATEST` is converted to `AT_TIMESTAMP` `now()` to prevent data loss if error occurs on first read\r\n- `RecordPublisherFactory` \r\n  - Added a `close()` method to allow `KinesisAsynClient` to be closed on shutdown\r\n- `FullJitterBackoff`\r\n  - Pulled the jitter backoff implementation into a separate class and referenced throughout\r\n-  `KinesisProxyV2Interface` / `KinesisProxyV2`\r\n  - Added `SubscribeToShard` thin proxy layer\r\n- `AwsV2Util`\r\n  - Updated client configurations for EFO:\r\n    - `maxConcurrency`: Added a new configuration to allow EFO concurrency to be defined separately from other services (list shards etc)\r\n    - `protocol`: Setting to `HTTP2`\r\n    - `connectionAcquisitionTimeout`/`healthCheckPingPeriod`/`initialWindowSize` set to handle startup with large shard count\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- `FlinkKinesisConsumerTest`\r\n- `KinesisDataFetcherTest`\r\n- `ShardConsumerFanOutTest`\r\n- `ShardConsumerTest`\r\n- `FanOutRecordPublisherConfigurationTest`\r\n- `FanOutRecordPublisherTest`\r\n- `KinesisProxyV2Test`\r\n- `AwsV2UtilTest`\r\n- `KinesisConfigUtilTest`\r\n\r\nFake behaviours for EFO added:\r\n- `FakeKinesisFanOutBehavioursFactory`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes (added EFO consumption)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? There is a [follow up task](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-18870) for documentation \r\n","created_at":"2020-08-10T08:39:28Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T07:20:52Z","closed_at":"2020-09-21T08:36:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b07b86b3fe470b5b6cf14ca1c9342ca4ef6c172d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273338726,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzM4NzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Kinesis","name":"component=Connectors/Kinesis","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13102/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13102/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13102/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/424e9b3074c77775e67066aa1fdd41f14bb2fbae","head":{"label":"dannycranmer:feature/FLINK-18515-efo-4-fan-out","ref":"feature/FLINK-18515-efo-4-fan-out","sha":"424e9b3074c77775e67066aa1fdd41f14bb2fbae","user":{"login":"dannycranmer","id":4950503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTA1MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4950503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer","html_url":"https://github.com/dannycranmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":278028335,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzgwMjgzMzU=","name":"flink","full_name":"dannycranmer/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dannycranmer","id":4950503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTA1MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4950503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer","html_url":"https://github.com/dannycranmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dannycranmer/flink","description":"Apache

between 1.10 and 1.11\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix the issue that tables created in 1.10 cannot be accessed in 1.11.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Try both new and old key when retrieving table schema from the properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nManually verified.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport filter() operation for Python DataStream API.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add filter() interface for Python DataStream API\r\n- Add a new Function class named FilterFunction and a wrapper class for user defined filter function.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change has test case covered by test_filter_with_data_types and test_filter_without_data_types in test_data_stream.py\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-10T04:42:50Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T11:44:52Z","closed_at":"2020-08-11T11:44:52Z","merged_at":"2020-08-11T11:44:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"f1e34e659aed9f7bbf7cd7c38e10e97ca88e4b73","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273030665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDMwNjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Python","name":"component=API/Python","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13098/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13098/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13098/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9eccf085ce92a91039325b98bb5de50ccd258f5e","head":{"label":"shuiqiangchen:FLINK-18866-filter","ref":"FLINK-18866-filter","sha":"9eccf085ce92a91039325b98bb5de50ccd258f5e","user":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":157520857,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTc1MjA4NTc=","name":"flink","full_name":"shuiqiangchen/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport key_by() operation for Python DataStream API.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add a new class nemed KeyStream to represent a keyed DataStream.\r\n- Add key_by() interface for DataStream.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change has test cases covered in test_key_by() and test_key_by_map() in test_data_stream.py\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-10T03:02:54Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T01:42:54Z","closed_at":"2020-08-11T01:42:53Z","merged_at":"2020-08-11T01:42:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"fa9e4a5ec330998239c9a8e6f974da5bb8c1599b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273030665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDMwNjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Python","name":"component=API/Python","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13097/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13097/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13097/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/eb8c81fd06223acfd43bf5b3f4778ba32e8b4ade","head":{"label":"shuiqiangchen:FLINK-18864","ref":"FLINK-18864","sha":"eb8c81fd06223acfd43bf5b3f4778ba32e8b4ade","user":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":157520857,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTc1MjA4NTc=","name":"flink","full_name":"shuiqiangchen/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* This pull request provides a clear explanation of the Kafka consumer behavior configured with \"setStartFromEarliest()\" when a partition offset becomes out of range.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-09T22:08:33Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T15:30:11Z","closed_at":"2020-08-11T06:38:48Z","merged_at":"2020-08-11T06:38:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"f777060106c1279d311165fedad8c2363d816ade","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273182709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgyNzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Kafka","name":"component=Connectors/Kafka","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13096/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13096/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13096/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/540b149f47c276dac5dbc26531ec8df58b2cc23d","head":{"label":"rk13:fix-doc-setStartFromEarliest","ref":"fix-doc-setStartFromEarliest","sha":"540b149f47c276dac5dbc26531ec8df58b2cc23d","user":{"login":"rk13","id":291422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13","html_url":"https://github.com/rk13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":286314495,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODYzMTQ0OTU=","name":"apache-flink","full_name":"rk13/apache-flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rk13","id":291422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13","html_url":"https://github.com/rk13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rk13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rk13/apache-flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport add_source() to get a DataStream for Python StreamExecutionEnvironment. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add SourceFunction interface in connectors module.\r\n- Add add_source() interface for StreamExecutionEnvironment.\r\n- Add a CustomSourceFunction interface for users to create a Java implemented SourceFunction.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change has test case covered by test_add_source() in test_connectors.py.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-09T16:24:30Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T01:55:07Z","closed_at":"2020-08-11T01:55:07Z","merged_at":"2020-08-11T01:55:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"0dad895b03ece20008b1a3194bc960c4709df878","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273030665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDMwNjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Python","name":"component=API/Python","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13095/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13095/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13095/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b2395efe294a7eed7dae338ca7958afa597669be","head":{"label":"shuiqiangchen:FLINK-18861","ref":"FLINK-18861","sha":"b2395efe294a7eed7dae338ca7958afa597669be","user":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":157520857,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTc1MjA4NTc=","name":"flink","full_name":"shuiqiangchen/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport add_sink() for Python DataStream API.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Add a new module named connectors which includes all source/sink related classes.\r\n - Add add_sink() interface for DataStream API.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change currently have no test case coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? ( not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-09T15:57:32Z","updated_at":"2020-08-10T10:47:06Z","closed_at":"2020-08-10T10:47:06Z","merged_at":"2020-08-10T10:47:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"b8d2ed787f89c97b47ab2d212a7f3b0e4cc57d50","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273030665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDMwNjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Python","name":"component=API/Python","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13094/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13094/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13094/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/ee75e6cf97ecb11fcff6f48251f0804a6d04c7d4","head":{"label":"shuiqiangchen:FLINK-18766","ref":"FLINK-18766","sha":"ee75e6cf97ecb11fcff6f48251f0804a6d04c7d4","user":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":157520857,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTc1MjA4NTc=","name":"flink","full_name":"shuiqiangchen/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTranslate \"Execution Plans\" page of \"Managing Execution\" into Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe page url is https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/zh/dev/execution_plans.html\r\n\r\nThe markdown file is located in `flink/docs/dev/execution_plans.zh.md`\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nTranslate `flink/docs/dev/execution_plans.zh.md`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-09T14:40:49Z","updated_at":"2020-09-10T03:07:36Z","closed_at":"2020-08-31T02:54:14Z","merged_at":"2020-08-31T02:54:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"a9950f9315531412e61c1ae07bd38ba304553187","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278841078,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4ODQxMDc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=chinese-translation","name":"component=chinese-translation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13093/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13093/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13093/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/7a3af48b8d5c9e484267f5a806a158304744e379","head":{"label":"Shawn-Hx:FLINK-18860","ref":"FLINK-18860","sha":"7a3af48b8d5c9e484267f5a806a158304744e379","user":{"login":"Shawn-Hx","id":18097476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx","html_url":"https://github.com/Shawn-Hx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":281891047,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODE4OTEwNDc=","name":"flink","full_name":"Shawn-Hx/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Shawn-Hx","id":18097476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx","html_url":"https://github.com/Shawn-Hx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shawn-Hx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Shawn-Hx/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Many specific properties for sql client can be replace with config options from flink-conf.yaml. such as: execution.parallelism can be replaced with parallelism.default.\r\nSql client does not support many properties from flink-conf.yaml for SET command, such as `state.backend`.\r\nAs discussed in [FLINK-18161](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-18161), we can deprecate sql client specific properties and support all properties from flink-conf.yaml. If there is a conflict between deprecate property and new property, just throws exception.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Let ConfigurationEntry accept all properties, and let ExecutionEntry accept properties which are defined*\r\n  - *add property conflict check when merging environment file and calling SET command*\r\n  - *update environment file and document*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Extended EnvironmentTest to verify the property conflict*\r\n  - *Extended LocalExecutorITCase to verify SET command*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n`CheckpointRequestDecider` uses lastCheckpointCompletionTime and pendingRequests.size to make a decision.\r\nWhile latter is currently checked under a lock, the former is not.\r\n\r\nSo it can see \"no pending checkpoints\" (fresh value of `pendingRequests.size`) and \"last checkpoint completed long time ago\" (stale value of `lastCheckpointCompletionTime`).\r\nTherefore, it decides to execute request, effictevely ignoring minPauseBetweenCheckpoint setting.\r\n\r\nThis increases checkpoint frequency, and in some cases decreases throughput (see ML thread).\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces function argument for `lastCheckpointCompletionTime` with a supplier, which is called under lock (similar to `pendingRequests.size()`).\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded unit test: `CheckpointCoordinatorTest.testMinCheckpointPause`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: yes, Checkpointing\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*support maxwell-json for Maxwell binlog collector*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *add DeserializationSchema for deserialize byte[]*\r\n  - *add SerializationSchema for serialize data to byte[]*\r\n  - *add formatfactory for DeserializationSchema&SerializationSchema*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added java tests for deserialize byte[] from table source & serialize data to byte[] into table sink*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: ( no )\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: ( no )\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: ( no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes )\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? ( docs / JavaDocs )\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-08T03:36:57Z","updated_at":"2020-08-12T03:11:59Z","closed_at":"2020-08-12T03:11:59Z","merged_at":"2020-08-12T03:11:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"2d75031d3d6bdc11c7b3fcf25cd43f396677003c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1274303759,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc0MzAzNzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Formats","name":"component=Formats","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13090/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13090/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13090/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c527896a27f2b12500b6b730ce07ab97ccbafff0","head":{"label":"dijiekstra:FLINK-18822","ref":"FLINK-18822","sha":"c527896a27f2b12500b6b730ce07ab97ccbafff0","user":{"login":"dijiekstra","id":19817318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODE3MzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19817318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra","html_url":"https://github.com/dijiekstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":285963020,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU5NjMwMjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"dijiekstra/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dijiekstra","id":19817318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODE3MzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19817318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra","html_url":"https://github.com/dijiekstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dijiekstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dijiekstra/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Translate the 'Local Installation' page of 'Try Flink' into Chinese*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*Translate the 'Local Installation' page of 'Try Flink' into Chinese*\r\n  - *The page url is https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.11/zh/try-flink/local_installation.html*\r\n  - *The markdown file is located in flink/docs/try-flink/local_installation.zh.md*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*A pure documentation Chinese translation*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? no\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-07T17:10:03Z","updated_at":"2020-08-22T01:01:54Z","closed_at":"2020-08-22T01:01:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"552bdadb55b92da3e59d4e25cba9f453e135704c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13089/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13089/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13089/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/593b3f8aa3746261620e359db1eb390a6d557297","head":{"label":"RocMarshal:FLINK-18813","ref":"FLINK-18813","sha":"593b3f8aa3746261620e359db1eb390a6d557297","user":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260947074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjA5NDcwNzQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"RocMarshal/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Translate the 'Side Outputs' page of 'DataStream API' into Chinese*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*Translate the 'Side Outputs' page of 'DataStream API' into Chinese*\r\n  - *The page url is https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.11/zh/dev/stream/side_output.html*\r\n  - *The markdown file is located in flink/docs/dev/stream/side_output.zh.md*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n* A pure documentation Chinese translation \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? no\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-07T17:06:20Z","updated_at":"2020-08-19T03:39:41Z","closed_at":"2020-08-19T03:39:41Z","merged_at":"2020-08-19T03:39:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"060ca9909360dba8726042cdca0bf1f1b6942268","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13088/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13088/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13088/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/80507ac0202292dd9477762342cf6a440db1f1b7","head":{"label":"RocMarshal:FLINK-18814","ref":"FLINK-18814","sha":"80507ac0202292dd9477762342cf6a440db1f1b7","user":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260947074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjA5NDcwNzQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"RocMarshal/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Fix the link-tags in the 'Side Outputs' page of 'DataStream API'*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*Fix the link-tags in the 'Side Outputs' page of 'DataStream API'*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*Fix the link-tags in the 'Side Outputs' page of 'DataStream API'*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? no\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-07T16:51:54Z","updated_at":"2020-08-10T02:27:59Z","closed_at":"2020-08-10T02:27:59Z","merged_at":"2020-08-10T02:27:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"a71d8aadb2cef90214f7762a747f950f20d90d1a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13087/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13087/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13087/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/95de6dd888c181aefc36f1803300cfeb1d0ca147","head":{"label":"RocMarshal:hotfix_fixlinktags4sideoutputs","ref":"hotfix_fixlinktags4sideoutputs","sha":"95de6dd888c181aefc36f1803300cfeb1d0ca147","user":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260947074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjA5NDcwNzQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"RocMarshal/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport JSON deserializes json array to multi records.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSupport JSON deserializes json array to multi records.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- JsonRowDataSerDeSchemaTest#testJsonArrayToMultiRecords\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / **docs** / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-06T14:53:42Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T03:39:02Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1274303759,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc0MzAzNzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Formats","name":"component=Formats","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13081/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13081/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13081/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b141ec85e9ce4392b55f7eae79fbfc03798decd5","head":{"label":"libenchao:feature/explode_json_array_to_multi_records","ref":"feature/explode_json_array_to_multi_records","sha":"b141ec85e9ce4392b55f7eae79fbfc03798decd5","user":{"login":"libenchao","id":4471524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzE1MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4471524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao","html_url":"https://github.com/libenchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":162708629,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjI3MDg2Mjk=","name":"flink","full_name":"libenchao/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"libenchao","id":4471524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzE1MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4471524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao","html_url":"https://github.com/libenchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/libenchao/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix streaming write to Hive 1.x Orc tables.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Check whether file exists before calling `FileSystem::getFileStatus` to get the size of in-progress files.\r\n  - Fix serialization issue for `OrcNoHiveBulkWriterFactory`\r\n  - Add `NoHivePhysicalWriterImpl` to fix NoSuchMethodError due to protobuf relocation in `orc-core-nohive`\r\n  - Add tests for streaming write to orc table.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nExisting and added tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThere are two e2e test run fail on aarch64. They are  `Streaming bucketing end-to-end test` and `PyFlink end-to-end test`.\r\n\r\n1. For  `Streaming bucketing end-to-end test`[1], it may be the `netty` problem. It needs more debug.\r\n\r\n2. For  `PyFlink end-to-end test`[2], there are two problem:\r\n    a. MiniConda doesn't support aarch64 currently.\r\n    b. Pyarrow which Pyflink depends on doesn't support aarch64 currently. \r\n\r\nWe can skip these two tests  on aarch64 until the problem is fixed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://logs.openlabtesting.org/logs/periodic-20-flink-mail/github.com/apache/flink/master/flink-end-to-end-test-cron-hadoopfree/94a8261/job-output.txt.gz\r\n[2]: https://logs.openlabtesting.org/logs/periodic-20-flink-mail/github.com/apache/flink/master/flink-end-to-end-test-cron-hadoop241/54ca93b/job-output.txt.gz\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSkip `Streaming bucketing end-to-end test` and `PyFlink end-to-end test` on aarch64 platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing e2e tests,.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no*)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request make the SourceOperator send the Watermark.MAX_VALUE to the downstream when closing.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- *Send the Watermark.MAX_VALUE in the close method of SourceOperator\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added test that validates that Watermark.MAX_VALUE is sent when closing*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-06T02:32:56Z","updated_at":"2020-10-29T14:22:01Z","closed_at":"2020-10-29T14:22:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8e1897f4fe9820063a09c64210e64404aee7d70b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273055469,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDU1NDY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/DataStream","name":"component=API/DataStream","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13073/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13073/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13073/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b9756b68f7db097660ef4605275b67a6bdbcf3b4","head":{"label":"Sxnan:FLINK-18820","ref":"FLINK-18820","sha":"b9756b68f7db097660ef4605275b67a6bdbcf3b4","user":{"login":"Sxnan","id":12155662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU1NjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12155662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan","html_url":"https://github.com/Sxnan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187957720,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc5NTc3MjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"Sxnan/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Sxnan","id":12155662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU1NjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12155662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan","html_url":"https://github.com/Sxnan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Sxnan/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix private method name typo in `LocationPreferenceSlotSelectionStrategy.java` and local variable name typo in `SlotPoolImpl.java`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Change the local variable name from  `allocatedSlotsSlotsByTaskManager` to `allocatedSlotsByTaskManager` in `SlotPoolImpl.java`\r\n- Change the private method name from `selectWitLocationPreference` to `selectWithLocationPreference` in `LocationPreferenceSlotSelectionStrategy.java`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, an exception in `PartitionRequestClientFactory` is propagated to the client directly. \r\nThe future in the internal `PartitionRequestClientFactory` map is not completed exceptionally.\r\nThis causes subsequent calls to wait indefinitely for the future to complete (see FLINK-18821).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by completing the future exceptionally in case of error.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded unit test: `PartitionRequestClientFactoryTest.testFailureReportedToSubsequentRequests`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport map() and flat_map() for Python DataStream API.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add map() and flat_map() for DataStream API, and Function, MapFunction, FlatMapFunctions interface.\r\n  - Add Java operator to launch Beam harness to run Python DataStream functions.\r\n  - Add coders to support encode/decode datas between java operator and python worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - test cases to test map() and flat_map() in test_data_stream.py\r\n  - test cases to test coders in test_coders.py\r\n \r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? ( not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-05T09:25:30Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T15:30:20Z","closed_at":"2020-08-09T03:32:20Z","merged_at":"2020-08-09T03:32:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"862c9eb0f48f57f8f420d00ac20987e1f8412215","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273030665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDMwNjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Python","name":"component=API/Python","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13066/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13066/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13066/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e412f8bec1d8dfa0ef317d8b9048b61935f1dfc1","head":{"label":"shuiqiangchen:FLINK-18765","ref":"FLINK-18765","sha":"e412f8bec1d8dfa0ef317d8b9048b61935f1dfc1","user":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":157520857,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTc1MjA4NTc=","name":"flink","full_name":"shuiqiangchen/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduced a new class named DataStream including its common interfaces. And support to get a DataStream through StreamExecutionEnvironment.from_collection(). \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- add a new python module named DataStream.\r\n- support to get a DataStream through StreamExecutionEnvironment.from_collection()\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is verified by the test cases in test_stream_execution_environment.py\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? ( not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-05T02:01:41Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T15:30:22Z","closed_at":"2020-08-05T07:49:57Z","merged_at":"2020-08-05T07:49:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"c966182ee051e4f21d8490a19f357abe86952af2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273030665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDMwNjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Python","name":"component=API/Python","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13061/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13061/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13061/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/368d8222d19ce27d3867747cad727def0ae35da1","head":{"label":"shuiqiangchen:FLINK-18764","ref":"FLINK-18764","sha":"368d8222d19ce27d3867747cad727def0ae35da1","user":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":157520857,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTc1MjA4NTc=","name":"flink","full_name":"shuiqiangchen/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Update the links' tags in the 'Debugging Windows & Event Time' page of 'Debugging & Monitoring'*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*Fix the links' tags in the 'Debugging Windows & Event Time' page of 'Debugging & Monitoring'*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*A pure documentation hot fix on link tag for the 'Debugging Windows & Event Time' page of 'Debugging & Monitoring'*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-04T14:30:22Z","updated_at":"2020-10-28T17:48:28Z","closed_at":"2020-10-28T17:48:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"000a5b8aa5ef8652092f39329c03f84250cd1765","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13059/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13059/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13059/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d0dc17404bdfab4e84838811f130a1e8c1695e55","head":{"label":"RocMarshal:hotfix-docs_ULT4Pdebugging_event_time","ref":"hotfix-docs_ULT4Pdebugging_event_time","sha":"d0dc17404bdfab4e84838811f130a1e8c1695e55","user":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260947074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjA5NDcwNzQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"RocMarshal/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nInspired when developing this https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/12995/commits/8519f65321ba24c5164196a67a05d98fb268f490, i find some unused dependency(e.g. com.github.mifmif:generex:1.0.2) in flink-kubernetes/pom.xml. It will be good if could remove it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Delete unused dependency and relocation `com.mifmif`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAll the current tests should pass.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-04T11:09:54Z","updated_at":"2020-08-05T08:57:21Z","closed_at":"2020-08-05T08:57:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d561a72e025161452ea0fada4d4cb9a15b372f44","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278776326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc2MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/Kubernetes","name":"component=Deployment/Kubernetes","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13058/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13058/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13058/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d1596d1c5c10b64f52ecc80488dfa5a7b6d59a5d","head":{"label":"wangyang0918:FLINK-18749-k8s-dependency","ref":"FLINK-18749-k8s-dependency","sha":"d1596d1c5c10b64f52ecc80488dfa5a7b6d59a5d","user":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205999027,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTkwMjc=","name":"flink","full_name":"wangyang0918/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo fix typo in the documentation.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Correct Scala code in the documentation\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\nNone of the above.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?: no\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-04T09:13:01Z","updated_at":"2020-08-06T09:27:02Z","closed_at":"2020-08-06T09:27:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4bb484487cdf2075a002664b15e65b84fb749011","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13057/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13057/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13057/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/768fa60772f66987aae6dce8c021144c56149548","head":{"label":"diohabara:diohabara/fix-typo","ref":"diohabara/fix-typo","sha":"768fa60772f66987aae6dce8c021144c56149548","user":{"login":"diohabara","id":37092773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDkyNzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37092773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara","html_url":"https://github.com/diohabara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":284930035,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODQ5MzAwMzU=","name":"flink","full_name":"diohabara/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"diohabara","id":37092773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDkyNzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37092773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara","html_url":"https://github.com/diohabara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diohabara/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/diohabara/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Translate \"Debugging Windows & Event Time\" page of \"Debugging & Monitoring\" into Chinese*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*Translate \"Debugging Windows & Event Time\" page of \"Debugging & Monitoring\" into Chinese*\r\n*The page url is https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.11/zh/monitoring/debugging_event_time.html*\r\n*The markdown file is located in flink/docs/monitoring/debugging_event_time.zh.md.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a pure documentation work without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **no**\r\n  - The serializers: **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **no**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: **no**\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: **no**\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? **no**\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? **not applicable**\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-03T15:48:54Z","updated_at":"2020-08-10T14:57:38Z","closed_at":"2020-08-10T14:57:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15f8a4a17be2ee718ccd91cbf514518c889c1289","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13056/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13056/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13056/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c5d0f281b1b2dc060933f522ec987845641e55ae","head":{"label":"RocMarshal:FLINK-18798","ref":"FLINK-18798","sha":"c5d0f281b1b2dc060933f522ec987845641e55ae","user":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260947074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjA5NDcwNzQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"RocMarshal/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal/flink","description":"Apache

necessary actions on its side.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* The ZooKeeperLeaderRetrievalService needs to inform its listener in case of connection loss since it might miss a leader change. The old implementation didn't trigger the listener in such a case.\r\n* This behavior was caused, for instance, when the TaskManager was lost its connection to the ZooKeeper and, therefore, wasn't informed about a leader change. Its tasks continued to run even though they got already recovered by another TaskManager. Hence, the same data got processed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* A method call was added when handling lost or suspended connections notifying the listener about the lost connection.\r\n* Two test cases were added to check the behavior.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n* Added unit test for checking whether the listener is NOT informed when there was not leader information retrieved, yet.\r\n* Added unit test for checking whether the listener is notified when the connection was lost but there was some previous leader information present already.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: yes\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis enables support for `ListView` and `MapView` in FLIP-65 aggregate functions. There are two major differences to the previous design:\r\n\r\n1. We use the internal serialization format for checkpoints/savepoints of views. Data structure converters are used at the edges which means that we support all data types and conversion classes.\r\n\r\n2. The data types of data views are expressed in a declarative way. We don't instantiate the accumulators anymore. Instead users can use annotations or override `getTypeInference`.\r\n\r\nOld aggregate functions are still supported when using `TableEnvironment.registerFunction`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSee commit messages.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as: `AggregateITCase`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: yes\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFlink supports redundant task managers in [FLINK-18625](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-18625). For a session cluster, there are no redundant task managers at first. After submitting a job, redundant task managers will be allocated. After cancelling the job, redundant task managers will not be released. It would be better to not keep such redundant resources when no job is running. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - If freeSlots' size equals slots' size in SlotManagerImpl, no job is running and no need to keep redundant taskManagers. Just release timeout task managers in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added test to verify that timeout task managers will be released if no job is running regardless of redundantTaskManagerNum.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd Chinese documentation for the new QoS settings in the RabbitMQ connector. The added English documentation can be found in the PR here: https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/12729/files#diff-6b432359b51642a8fad3050c4b73f47cR134-R167\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - add Chinese documentation for the new QoS settings in the RabbitMQ connector into docs/dev/connectors/rabbitmq.zh.md\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nSupport HBase 2.1.0\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *flink-yarn* need a new method for token delegation of HBase.\r\n  - *flink-connector-hbase* replaced deprecated methods(available in 1.4.3 and 2.1.0), changed hbase-1.4 to hbase table factory and fixes dependencies for 2.1.0.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests for flink-yarn and flink-connector-hbase\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **yes**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **no**\r\n  - The serializers: **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **no**\r\n  -

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis patch fixes the `CheckpointCoordinator` to make it work with `ExternallyInducedSource`  in cases that the task snapshots are triggered by the external systems via master hooks, rather than the checkpoint coordinator.\r\n\r\nThe problem in the current code is that when the task snapshots are triggered externally via the master hooks, the checkpoint coordinator may receive all the acks from the tasks before the master state snapshot completes. And this leads to checkpoint failure. The fix is to only finalize the checkpoint when all of the operator coordinator checkpoint, master snapshots and task snapshots are fully taken.\r\n\r\nThis patch also fixes the order of component checkpoint by putting the `OperatorCoordinator` checkpoint to before the master hooks invocation.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Finalize the checkpoint when the checkpoint is fully acknowledged, which can be triggered from either the acknowledge of task snapshot or master snapshot.\r\n- Adjust the checkpoint order from `(master hooks, OperatorCoordinators) -> tasks` to `OperatorCoordinators -> master hooks -> tasks`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified by running `CheckpointCoordinatorTest#testTaskCheckpointTriggeredByMasterHooks()`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd Chinese documentation for the new QoS settings in the RabbitMQ connector. The added English documentation can be found in the PR here: https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/12729/files#diff-6b432359b51642a8fad3050c4b73f47cR134-R167\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n  - add Chinese documentation for the new QoS settings in the RabbitMQ connector into  docs/dev/connectors/rabbitmq.zh.md\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis adds the configuration option `cluster.processes.halt-on-fatal-error`\r\nwhich defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, a custom SecurityManager will be\r\ninstalled on top of the existing SecurityManager to exit forcefully via\r\n`Runtime#halt`.\r\n\r\nExiting that way may be necessary due to the Java 8 JVM freezing during a\r\ngraceful shutdown when using the G1 garbage collector.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- If `cluster.processes.halt-on-fatal-error: true` is set in the config,\r\nthe shutdown will be performed via `Runtime#halt` instead of `System#exit`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - Addded unit tests\r\n  - Added integration test\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nFix Typo\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nFix Typo for api.common.eventtime.WatermarkStrategy Description\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial typo fix without any test coverage.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n`cd docs\r\n./build_docs.sh -p`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **no**\r\n  - The serializers: **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **no**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: **no**\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: **no**\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?  **no**\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? **not applicable**\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-31T17:44:24Z","updated_at":"2020-08-04T09:41:04Z","closed_at":"2020-08-04T09:41:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d4b346ff9c43a54fca3be7543c26d11b1283152","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13041/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13041/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13041/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/25bb9724edea0d59f612342701017575f87aae7c","head":{"label":"chrislan815:master","ref":"master","sha":"25bb9724edea0d59f612342701017575f87aae7c","user":{"login":"chrislan815","id":23533430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTMzNDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23533430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrislan815","html_url":"https://github.com/chrislan815","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrislan815/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrislan815/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrislan815/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrislan815/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrislan815/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrislan815/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrislan815/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrislan815/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrislan815/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c22c9c1f1090bf8e0bae7c3609c678cb7532f9df","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBack pressure the checkpointing system when there are too many checkpoints to clean.\r\nSee design doc here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q0y0aWlJMoUWNW7jjsM8uWfHsy2dM6YmmcmhpQzgLMA/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nPlease see comments in the implementation plan section for an explanation of the choices made (classes responsibilities, interfaces, thresholds, resume conditions ...)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- CheckpointStores are now responsible for checkpoints to clean count. This count is incremented when an asynchronous execution of checkpoint discard is submitted and decremented when the discard is finished (either fail or success) \r\n- CheckpointRequestDecider stops choosing new checkpoint trigger requests while there are too many checkpoints to clean. When the number of checkpoints to clean becomes below the threshold, CheckpointRequestDecider starts to pick up checkpoint requests again.\r\n- threshold of max checkpoints to clean is configurable as a new configuration item.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows: stop and resume checkpoint trigger request pick up by CheckpointRequestDecider.\r\nI did not make a IT test for endurance (verify there is no OOM error) when there is a high frequency of checkpoints cleaning requests. I'm not sure it is needed, tell me if you think it's needed.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes checkpointing)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n\r\nR: @ifndef-SleePy @rkhachatryan .

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `MiniBatchIntervalInferRule` doesn't take FLIP-95 source into account, therefore there's no `MiniBatchAssigner` node generated, and the minibatch will never be triggered. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add `MiniBatchAssigner` when matches `StreamExecTableSourceScan` in `MiniBatchIntervalInferRule`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Enable minibatch in `KafkaChangelogTableITCase#testKafkaDebeziumChangelogSource` to reproduce this problem. \r\n- Cover FLIP-95 sources in `MiniBatchIntervalInferTest`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nEnables parallel user-code and plugin class loader.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Mark class loaders as parallel usable.\r\n- Adjust locking in user class loaders (plugin already used the appropriate method). \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNo new test (test ideas welcome), covered by all IT and e2e tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupports basic TypeInformation including BasicTypeInfo, LocalTimeTypeInfo, PrimitiveArrayTypeInfo, RowTypeInfo. \r\n\r\nTypes.ROW()/Types.ROW_NAMED()/Types.PRIMITIVE_ARRAY() should also be supported.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add python wrapper class for BasicTypeInformation, PrimitiveArrayTypeInfos and RowTypeInfo, etc.\r\n  - Introduce a new type info named PickledArrayTypeInfo to indicate the type of bytes array data derived from pickled python objects.\r\n  - Add utils to convert python typeInfo and java typeInfo.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as:\r\n- TypeInfoTests in test_typeinfo.py\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? ( not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-30T12:07:23Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T15:30:31Z","closed_at":"2020-08-05T01:35:58Z","merged_at":"2020-08-05T01:35:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"ea9f44985ab387f1a234f25e9a74ce697a6cb982","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273030665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDMwNjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Python","name":"component=API/Python","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13029/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13029/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13029/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/2c7ff6ceffd4f6be815e98befb669a07d98dc768","head":{"label":"shuiqiangchen:FLINK-18763","ref":"FLINK-18763","sha":"2c7ff6ceffd4f6be815e98befb669a07d98dc768","user":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":157520857,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTc1MjA4NTc=","name":"flink","full_name":"shuiqiangchen/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen/flink","description":"Apache
