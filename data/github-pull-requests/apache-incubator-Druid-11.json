#15371 eliminated ObjectColumnSelector's built-in implementations of numeric methods, which had been marked deprecated.\r\n\r\nHowever, some complex types, like SpectatorHistogram, can be successfully coerced to number. The documentation for spectator histograms encourages taking advantage of this by aggregating complex columns with doubleSum and longSum. Currently, this doesn't work properly for IncrementalIndex, where the behavior relied on those deprecated ObjectColumnSelector methods.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the behavior by making two changes:\r\n\r\n1) SimpleXYZAggregatorFactory (XYZ = type; base class for simple numeric aggregators;\r\n   all of these extend NullableNumericAggregatorFactory) use getObject for STRING\r\n   and COMPLEX. Previously, getObject was only used for STRING.\r\n\r\n2) NullableNumericAggregatorFactory (base class for simple numeric aggregators)\r\n   has a new protected method \"useGetObject\". This allows the base class to\r\n   correctly check for null (using getObject or isNull).\r\n\r\nThe patch also adds a test for SpectatorHistogram + doubleSum + IncrementalIndex. Thanks @bsyk for the test, which I pulled from #16562.","created_at":"2024-06-06T05:03:46Z","updated_at":"2024-10-04T06:35:04Z","closed_at":"2024-07-25T15:45:30Z","merged_at":"2024-07-25T15:45:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"b2a88da200bb435e5e231d50c97177fcb9b8d3f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1433958072,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDMzOTU4MDcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Dependencies","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nWhen ingesting data from Azure blob storage, you can currently only do so if your SAS token has `write` permissions, even though this is not required to list and read blob objects.\r\n\r\nThe source of this bug lies in the fact that all calls in `AzureStorage` get a container client by calling `createBlobContainerIfNotExists`. This SDK method performs an API call that needs `write` permissions.\r\n\r\n#### Bugfix\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, I updated the calls getting container clients in `AzureStorage` to only use `createBlobContainerIfNotExists` for write operations, where it makes sense.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, `getBlockBlobOutputStream` and `uploadBlockBlob` will continue to create a container if it doesn't exist. This is useful when using Azure blob storage for deep storage and/or task logs.\r\n\r\n> That said, this behaviour is somewhat unique to the Azure extension. In S3 for example, I believe the bucket needs to exist. It might make sense to deprecate this behaviour in the future to be more consistent across Druid, and require the container to exist.\r\n\r\nAll the other calls (read blob storage, check if blob exists, list blobs in the container, delete blobs) will require the container to exist. I believe this makes sense given the nature of these calls.\r\n\r\n#### Other changes\r\n\r\nI also cleaned up the `AzureStorage` class so it can be more easily maintained in the future. Specifically, I\r\n\r\n- used Azure terminology throughout the class (e.g. `prefix` vs `virtualDirPath`)\r\n- added `@Nullable` annotations where parameters are optional\r\n- added a whole bunch of Javadoc\r\n- replaced `getBlockBlobReferenceWithAttributes` with `getBlockBlobLength` because all the usages would only get the blob length.\r\n\r\n### Manual testing\r\n\r\nIn addition to the unit tests, I performed the following testing manual:\r\n\r\n- Configured Azure for deep storage (`druid.storage.type=azure`) with a non-existing container (and an SAS token with `create` and `write` permissions), and made sure the container is still created if it doesn't exist, and that segment files are persisted as expected.\r\n- Configured Azure for task logs (`druid.indexer.logs.type=azure`) and verified the same as above\r\n- Ingested from Azure blob storage using a read-only SAS token (with the same setup as above, deep storage and task logs going to a different container on the same account)\r\n\r\n### Future improvements\r\n\r\nI will try to improve this extension some more in future PRs. Specifically, \r\n\r\n- we could use the batch SDK when deleting a container (`emptyCloudBlobDirectory`) or just deleting the whole container at once, instead of deleting each file individually\r\n- we should do some more validation on the Azure config (some of it has been addressed in #16561)\r\n- we should allow ingesting from public containers that do not require any credentials\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n\r\n * `AzureStorage`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-05T20:02:18Z","updated_at":"2024-10-04T06:41:33Z","closed_at":"2024-06-07T16:47:51Z","merged_at":"2024-06-07T16:47:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"e6a82e8a11f23bf5808ac5a6a7216c9c6a437c92","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1433958072,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDMzOTU4MDcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Dependencies","name":"Area

Problem\r\n\r\nCustom lookup extensions can have different lookup name syntax - i.e., the `LOOKUP` function can have semantics for the lookup name. With the selective loading of lookups in [MSQ](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16358), the lookup loads only the required lookups based on what's specified in the ingest SQL.\r\n\r\nHowever, with custom lookup implementations, the `lookupName` parsed from the query can differ from what's configured. Because of this mismatch, the `LookupReferencesManager` will not load the lookups specified in the query if it doesn't find an exact match with what's configured with the coordinator. As a result, MSQ queries involving such lookups will fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR adds support for returning the canonical lookup name in the `LookupExtractorFactoryContainerProvider` interface. It delegates getting the sanitized lookup name to the underlying `LookupExtractorFactoryContainerProvider`:\r\n- For the `druid-lookups-cached-global`, `druid-lookups-cached-single` and `kafka-extraction-namespace`, the canonical name is the same as the lookup name. \r\n- For other implementations, it offers the flexibility to return a different canonical lookup name for the parsed lookup name if needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ]

ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nThere is a race condition in `CuratorDruidLeaderSelector` which may occur as follows:\r\n- Current node is elected as leader\r\n- `LeaderLatchListener.isLeader()` is called which calls `DruidLeaderSelector.Listener.becomeLeader()`\r\n- `listener.becomeLeader()` fails\r\n- `CuratorDruidLeaderSelector.isLeader()` is called and returns `false` but `CuratorDruidLeaderSelector.getCurrentLeader()` returns self, because the leader latch has not been updated yet\r\n- `LeaderLatch` is recreated and updated atomically\r\n- Subsequent calls to `getCurrentLeader()` return `null` until some other node is elected leader\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n- Update `leader = true` only after `listener.becomeLeader()` has succeeded\r\n- Return `null` in `getCurrentLeader()` if `leader = false` and `LeaderLatch.getLeader()` returns self\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n- Add some unit tests to `CuratorDruidLeaderSelector`\r\n- Remove unused parameter from `K8sDruidLeaderSelector`\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-04T14:42:18Z","updated_at":"2024-11-14T00:20:49Z","closed_at":"2024-11-14T00:20:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1252153393,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUyMTUzMzkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/16544/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/16544/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/16544/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/54cdbb5930f0bb3b52f6aad6263e8db4b498c90d","head":{"label":"kfaraz:add_curator_leader_tests","ref":"add_curator_leader_tests","sha":"54cdbb5930f0bb3b52f6aad6263e8db4b498c90d","user":{"login":"kfaraz","id":18635897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjM1ODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18635897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz","html_url":"https://github.com/kfaraz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355434171,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU0MzQxNzE=","name":"druid","full_name":"kfaraz/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kfaraz","id":18635897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjM1ODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18635897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz","html_url":"https://github.com/kfaraz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kfaraz/druid","description":"Apache

Description\r\nThis PR reworks `Cursor` and `VectorCursor` creation from `CursorFactory` (`StorageAdapter`) to be more efficient and push additional details about the query into the process with a newly introduced `CursorBuildSpec`. A new `CursorHolder` interface has been added that is constructed by another new interface, `CursorHolderFactory` with a method `makeCursorHolder`, which accepts the `CursorBuildSpec` and replaces the arguments of `CursorFactory.makeCursors` and `CursorFactory.makeVectorCursors`.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal here is to make it easy to push these details down to cursor creation for an upcoming feature under development, projections, which are effectively a type of materialized views that live within segments and will be created at ingestion time. More details on this coming later once I finish writing the proposal, but basically we need to know stuff like what grouping columns, filters, aggregations, etc, are involved in a query in order to be able to automatically select the appropriate projection available within the segment, or using the regular default segment rows if no matching projections are available.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the primary goal, this refactor also allows cursor creation to be more efficient. Since `CursorHolder` is created from the `CursorBuildSpec`, the `canVectorize`, `asCursor`, and `asVectorCursor` methods can all share and re-use the same resources. \r\n\r\nFinally, since this PR is introducing new cursor building interfaces, it is also taking the opportunity to downplay the prominence of time ordering, particularly query granularity and its role in cursors. `CursorFactory.makeCursors` previously returned a `Sequence<Cursor>`, corresponding to query granularity buckets. It has been transitioned to no longer do this in `CursorHolder.asCursor`, instead returning a single `Cursor`, equivalent to using `ALL` granularity with the previous method but without being wrapped in a `Sequence`. Query granularity in engines is now handled using a new `CursorGranularizer` which is equivalent to how the vectorized engine works, simplifying query engines which do not care about query granularity, and making things easier for engines in the future to have segments which are not sorted by time.\r\n\r\n`StorageAdapter` is a `@PublicApi`, and extends `CursorFactory`, so a default implementation of `CursorHolderFactory` that is backed by the old `canVectorize`, `makeCursors`, and `makeVectorCursor` methods is provided. That said, all of the built-in query engines and tests have been migrated to use `makeCursorHolder`, all `CursorFactory` implementations have been migrated to `CursorHolderFactory`, and the old methods of `CursorFactory` have been marked as `@Deprecated`, and implementations of `CursorFactory` have been completely removed.\r\n\r\n#### summary of changes\r\n* Added `CursorBuildSpec` which captures all of the 'interesting' stuff that goes into producing a cursor as a replacement for the method arguments of `CursorFactory.canVectorize`, `CursorFactory.makeCursor`, and `CursorFactory.makeVectorCursor`\r\n* added new interface `CursorHolder` and new interface `CursorHolderFactory` as a replacement for `CursorFactory`, with method `makeCursorHolder`, which takes a `CursorBuildSpec` as an argument and replaces `CursorFactory.canVectorize`, `CursorFactory.makeCursor`, and `CursorFactory.makeVectorCursor`\r\n* `CursorFactory.makeCursors` previously returned a `Sequence<Cursor>` corresponding to the query granularity buckets, with a separate `Cursor` per bucket. `CursorHolder.asCursor` instead returns a single `Cursor` (equivalent to 'ALL' granularity), and a new `CursorGranularizer` has been added for query engines to iterate over the cursor and divide into granularity buckets. This makes the non-vectorized engine behave the same way as the vectorized query engine (with its `VectorCursorGranularizer`), and simplifies a lot of stuff that has to read segments particularly if it does not care about bucketing the results into granularities. \r\n* Deprecated `CursorFactory`, `CursorFactory.canVectorize`, `CursorFactory.makeCursors`, and `CursorFactory.makeVectorCursor`\r\n* updated all `StorageAdapter` implementations to implement `makeCursorHolder`, transitioned direct `CursorFactory` implementations to instead implement `CursorMakerFactory`. `StorageAdapter` being a `CursorMakerFactory` is intended to be a transitional thing, ideally will not be released in favor of moving `CursorMakerFactory` to be fetched directly from `Segment`, however this PR was already large enough so this will be done in a follow-up.\r\n* updated all query engines to use `makeCursorHolder`, granularity based engines to use `CursorGranularizer`.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n_(for developers)_\r\n\r\nUse notes from  #16985 instead\r\n\r\n~~There is a change to the `StorageAdapter` interface, which is a 'public' api for extension writers to add additional types of segments to participate in Druids query engines. `StorageAdapter` extends the `CursorFactory` interface, whose methods `canVectorize`, `makeCursors`, and `makeVectorCursor` have been deprecated. This interface is replaced with a new `CursorHolderFactory`, which `StorageAdapter` implements, with method `makeCursorHolder`, which accepts a `CursorBuildSpec` and returns a new interface `CursorHolder` which defines no argument versions of `canVectorize`, `asCursor`, and `asVectorCursor`.~~\r\n\r\n~~A default implementation of `makeCursorHolder` is provided that uses the existing deprecated methods, so no immediate action is needed for `StorageAdapter` implementors on upgrade, but implementors should plan in the future to migrate to implementing `CursorHolderFactory` directly. Custom query engines can no longer use these deprecated methods, as they have been removed from all `StorageAdapter` implementations. Use `CursorHolder` instead. `CursorHolder.asCursor` is equivalent to calling `CursorFactory.getCursors` with `ALL` granularity. Any custom engines which need to bucket the cursor by query granularity should instead use `CursorGranularizer`, which can be used to produce a set of intervals and advance the cursor within those intervals.~~\r\n\r\n_(for users)_\r\nDue to some internal refactoring, TopN queries no longer can use the \"pooled\" algorithms internally for query granularities other than 'ALL', unless the columns value cardinality is smaller than the internally computed \"numValuesPerPass\", which is based on processing buffer size and projected aggregator size. This is not completely obvious from a users perspective, so the only indicator might be a performance difference for TopN queries with other query granularities. SQL will only ever plan to a TopN query with 'ALL' granularity so it is not affected.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `CursorHolderFactory`\r\n * `CursorHolder`\r\n * `CursorBuildSpec`\r\n * `CursorGranularizer`\r\n * `Cursor`\r\n * `Offset`\r\n * `CursorFactory` (deprecated)\r\n * `GroupingEngine` (to use `CursorHolder` and `CursorGranularizer`)\r\n * `TimeseriesQueryEngine` (to use `CursorHolder` and `CursorGranularizer`)\r\n * `TopNQueryEngine` (to use `CursorHolder` and `CursorGranularizer`)\r\n * All other built-in query engines to use `CursorHolder`\r\n * All tests that use `CursorFactory` methods now use `CursorHolder`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes up a deadlock that can happen when a worker executes multiple stages in parallel. The deadlock happens because, under the above circumstance, there are multiple instances of `RunAllFullyWidget` sharing a single `Bouncer`. \r\n\r\nThe deadlock happens as follows:\r\nThe bouncer hands out tickets to `RunAllFullyWidget1` and `RunAllFullyWidget2`. Two threads call `cleanup()` on the two widgets at the same time:\r\n\r\nThread1 has the lock on `RunAllFullyWidget1` and Thread2 has the lock on `RunAllFullyWidget2` (since they have entered the `cleanup()` method). \r\n\r\n`cleanup()` gives back the tickets that the widgets have acquired to the bouncer. \r\n\r\nThread1 giving back the ticket triggers the listener on the `RunAllFullyWidget2` to acquire the ticket. \r\nThread2 giving back the ticket triggers the listener on the `RunAllFullyWidget1` to acquire the ticket.\r\n\r\nHowever, the above operations can't succeed, since each thread holds up the lock the other thread needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nJstack of the deadlock. Thanks @Akshat-Jain for providing the JStack \r\n```\r\n  51 \"processing-8\":\r\n  51         at org.apache.druid.frame.processor.RunAllFullyWidget$RunAllFullyRunnable.lambda$run$3(RunAllFullyWidget.java:234)\r\n  49         -

packages\r\n- Updated annotations (Lifecycle annotations like `@BeforeEach`)\r\n- Updated exception testing (`assertThrows`)\r\n- Updated temporary path handling (use `@TempDir` annotation)\r\n- Various other updates (replace other `Rule` usages, make sure to use JUnit 5 assertions, ...)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

This was seen in one of the CPU profiles taken on indexers.\r\nThe fix for this is to have a flag which tracks changes to the dimension lookup dictionary and use that value at the end instead of checking the dimension lookup dictionary again.\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/111732128/b5ade0f6-e099-4f20-8dc4-535bb05a0b19)\r\nEven in `DictionaryEncodedColumnMerger::processMergedRow`, the size() method on the row is expensive and its called twice when the same value which was computed in the beginning can be reused.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * [CHANGED] processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/segment/StringDimensionIndexer::processRowValsToUnsortedEncodedKeyComponent\r\n * [CHANGED] processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/segment/DictionaryEncodedColumnMerger::processMergedRow\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

3.2.0 released recently: https://github.com/delta-io/delta/releases/tag/v3.2.0\r\n\r\n- Upgrade the Delta Kernel dependency to 3.2.0.\r\n- Notable breaking changes introduced in the upstream that affect the Druid extension:\r\n    - Rename `TableClient` to `Engine`.\r\n    - Rename `DefaultTableClient` to `DefaultEngine`.\r\n    - `Table.getPath()` no longer throws a `TableNotFoundException`; instead, the exception is thrown when getting snapshot info from the `Table` object.\r\n    - Exceptions moved to a separate package.\r\n   \r\n\r\nNote that none of the above breaking changes are user-facing.\r\n\r\nThe upstream 3.2.0 release includes a new feature to read arbitrary snapshots. Currently, the Druid extension only supports reading the latest snapshots, which is a [documented limitation](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/development/extensions-contrib/delta-lake/#known-limitations). We can remove the limitation once we add support for that in this extension.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

it's possible to submit a really big task payload and have it OOM the overlord if the request fails and logs the whole thing in SQLMetadataStorageActionHandler.insertEntryWithHandle.\r\n\r\nIf the request happens to be larger than max_allowed_packet for a mysql metadata store it will always fail. Since really large task payloads seem to cause overlord instability in general I think it makes sense to limit the size of task payloads at the task queue level.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nAdd a new config that sets a limit for task payload sizes. Throw a exception if the limit is exceeded.\r\n\r\nThe default limit of 60 MB is based on the 64 MB default value of max_allowed_packet in MySQL 8+.\r\n\r\nI would ideally like to use the http request content-length header to calculate the size of the task payload rather than re-serializing it in memory but we also call taskQueue.add directly from supervisors so that would bypass the check. If others think this is acceptable and it would be better to check Content-Length in OverlordResource I am fine with changing this logic.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- Adding a new guardrail for submitting tasks that are too large\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `TaskQueue`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n[Grouping on complex columns](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16068) allowed the dimensions to be of complex types. When reading the dimensions from their serialized format, we must deserialize them in their desired complex type. Otherwise, Druid deserializes the dimension into a generic java object equivalent to `objectMapper.readValue(serializedValue, Object.class)` \r\n\r\nWe read the dimensions from their serialized form when reading dimensions over the wire (in native queries)\r\n\r\nThis wasn't discovered at the time of the original PR because only JSON columns support groupability at the moment, and they are designed to handle the generic Java object that the object mapper deserializes to by default. However, this is required for most other complex types that require groupability. \r\n\r\n### Interface change\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic interface TypeStrategy<T> extends Comparator<Object>, Hash.Strategy<T>\r\n{\r\n...\r\n  default Class<?> complexDimensionType()\r\n  {\r\n     // To be implemented by any type supporting groupability\r\n     // Throws exception by default\r\n  }\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nBenchmarking - I have ran the `GroupByBenchmark.queryMultiQueryableIndexWithSerde` benchmark with limited iterations and here are the results before and after the change. \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith changes, + array\r\nBenchmark                                           (initialBuckets)  (numProcessingThreads)  (numSegments)  (queryGranularity)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schemaAndQuery)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt       Score       Error  Units\r\nGroupByBenchmark.queryMultiQueryableIndexWithSerde                -1                       2              4                 all            100000           basic.A        force  avgt    6  183664.081 ± 18777.234  us/op\r\n\r\nWithout changes + array\r\nBenchmark                                           (initialBuckets)  (numProcessingThreads)  (numSegments)  (queryGranularity)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schemaAndQuery)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt       Score       Error  Units\r\nGroupByBenchmark.queryMultiQueryableIndexWithSerde                -1                       2              4                 all            100000           basic.A        force  avgt    6  184934.791 ± 18924.516  us/op\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n(none) \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

This functionality aims to optimize resource utilization and improve task execution efficiency by tailoring pod specifications to the needs of different task characteristics.\r\nDruid operator can define execution strategies and associate them with different task characteristics  through the new dynamic config interface. The system will apply these strategies dynamically as tasks are scheduled for execution.\r\nThis feature is a step towards making Apache Druid more adaptable and efficient in Kubernetes environments, addressing the need for more granular control over resource allocation and task scheduling.\r\n\r\n#### Example Configuration:\r\nWe define two template keys in the configuration—`low-throughput` and `medium-throughput`—each associated with specific task conditions and arranged in a priority order.\r\n\r\n- Low Throughput Template: This is the first template evaluated and has the highest priority. Tasks that have a context tag `billingCategory=streaming_ingestion` and a datasource of `wikipedia` will be classified under the `low-throughput` template. This classification directs such tasks to utilize a predefined pod template optimized for low throughput requirements.\r\n\r\n- Medium Throughput Template: If a task does not meet the low-throughput criteria, the system will then evaluate it against the next selector in order. In this example, if the task type is index_kafka, it will fall into the `medium-throughput` template.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"default\",\r\n  \"podTemplateSelectStrategy\":\r\n  {\r\n    \"type\": \"selectorBased\",\r\n    \"selectors\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"selectionKey\": \"low-throughput\",\r\n        \"context.tags\":\r\n        {\r\n          \"billingCategory\": [\"streaming_ingestion\"]\r\n        },\r\n        \"dataSource\": [\"wikipedia\"]\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"selectionKey\": \"medium-throughput\",\r\n        \"type\": [\"index_kafka\"]\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"defaultKey\": \"base\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\nThe column names defined in the iceberg catalog schema may not have the same case as those column names defined in the data files itself. Since the Iceberg table scan context enables case sensitivity by default, this can break filter calls during the scan operation if the column name cases don't match.\r\nThis PR adds config: `caseSensitive` to the Iceberg catalog spec of `IcebergInputSource` that toggles the case sensitivity. Setting this to `false` fixes the scenario described above.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR aims to enable the re-ordering of window operators in order to optimise the sort and partition operators.\r\nExample : \r\n`SELECT m1, m2,\r\nSUM(m1) OVER(PARTITION BY m2) as sum1,\r\nSUM(m2) OVER() as sum2\r\nfrom numFoo\r\nGROUP BY m1,m2`\r\n\r\nIn order to compute this query, we can order the operators as to first compute the operators corresponding to sum2 and then place the operators corresponding to sum1 which would help us in reducing one sort operator if we order our operators by sum1 and then sum2.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `Windowing`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR optimises S3 storage writing for MSQ durable storage by uploading the chunks to S3 in a separate threadpool.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we were creating and uploading a chunk to S3 sequentially, which isn't optimal.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the logic such that the creation of chunks still happen in the same processing threadpool, but the uploading of chunks is offloaded to a separate threadpool.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\n1. For every operation, I verified the number of rows returned with this PR's changes match the number of rows returned without this PR's changes.\r\n2. For every operation, I verified the output files and their sizes (in S3) with this PR's changes match the corresponding files uploaded without this PR's changes.\r\n\r\n## Timing Data\r\n\r\nFollowing section summarizes the query duration comparison for a few different queries. We compare the original duration with the new duration across a few combinations of parameters.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n1. `trips_xaa` is one of the sample datasources with 60M rows.\r\n3.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Problems\r\n1. The segment bootstrapping logic relies on the presence of configured storage locations. That is, only servers that have storage location configured will act like a \"segment data server\". Tasks on the other hand don't have this static configuration because tasks can dynamically run on any slot. The `CliPeon` injects a list of dynamic `StorageLocation`s. This `List<StorageLocation>` is not currently present in `SegmentLoadDropHandler`, which does the bootstrapping of segments as part of its `start()` lifecycle. Instead, this class directly uses `config.getLocations()`, which isn't set by the `TaskToolboxFactory` when it instantiates `SegmentCacheManager`.\r\n\r\n2. One of the overloaded constructors marked `@VisibleForTesting` in `SegmentLocalCacheManager` is also being used by tasks via `SegmentCacheManagerFactory`. This \"test constructor\" also does not initialize the thread pool executors, so segments won't be loaded into the page cache even if loader config has the appropriate settings.\r\n\r\n### Core changes\r\n\r\nThe core part of the fix in `SegmentLoadDropHandler` is to rely on the source of truth for the caching layer: `SegmentCacheManager`. Currently, the various interactions of the classes are complex and have abstraction leaks in its implementation:\r\n-  `SegmentManager` -> `SegmentCacheLoader` -> `SegmentCacheManager`\r\n- `SegmentLoadDropHandler` -> `SegmentManager` -> `SegmentCacheLoader` -> `SegmentCacheManager`\r\n-  `SegmentLoadDropHandler` ->  `SegmentCacheManager`\r\n\r\nThe `SegmentLoadDropHandler` directly handles the segment info file creation and deletion. These low-level file operations should really be owned and handled by the `SegmentCacheManager` and the classes that interact with should just operate at the granularity of `Segment` objects.\r\n\r\n#### With this patch, the updated interactions are as follows:\r\n- `SegmentManager` -> `SegmentCacheManager`\r\n- `SegmentLoadDropHandler` -> `SegmentManager` -> `SegmentCacheManager`\r\n \r\nThe addition and deletion of segment info files are handled by the `SegmentLocalCacheManager` class itself. The `SegmentLoadDropHandler` gets the set of cached segments from the `SegmentManager`. To that effect, the dependencies in `SegmentLoadDropHandler` have been cleaned up, and this class doesn't fiddle with the segment files directly. \r\n\r\nIn order to simplify this, we did the following:\r\n1. Removed the `SegmentLoader` interface and its concrete implementation `SegmentLocalCacheLoader`. The implementation was acting as a simple factory of Segment objects from the underlying segment files, which has now been moved to  `SegmentLocalCacheManager`, still providing convenience for any test overrides for the factory.\r\n\r\n2. Added the following methods to `SegmentCacheManager` for callers to interact with:\r\n    * boolean canHandleSegments():  A high-level method that informs callers whether the caching layer can handle segments or not.\r\n    * List<DataSegment> getCachedSegments()\r\n    * void storeInfoFile(DataSegment segment)\r\n    * void removeInfoFile(DataSegment segment)\r\n    * ReferenceCountingSegment getSegment(DataSegment segment)\r\n    * ReferenceCountingSegment getBootstrapSegment(DataSegment segment, SegmentLazyLoadFailCallback loadFailed)\r\n    * void loadSegmentIntoPageCache(DataSegment segment)\r\n    * void loadSegmentIntoPageCacheOnBootstrap(DataSegment segment)\r\n\r\n- `SegmentManager` is now responsible for calling `storeInfoFile(segment)` once the segment bookkeeping stuff is successful as part of the load segment flow.\r\n- The bootstrap executor was initialized by `SegmentLoadDropHandler`, which is now moved to the `SegmentLocalCacheManager`., along with the initialization of the segment download executor.\r\n- Methods in `SegmentManager` and `SegmentLocalCacheManager` have bene broken down into `loadSegment()` and `loadBootstrapSegment()` variants, because segment lazy loading and the fail callback are only applicable for the bootstrap segment flow. This cleanup ensures that callers don't pass unnecessary null arguments anymore and makes the intent clearer.\r\n- Remove some `VisibleForTesting` hooks, including the problematic  \"test constructor\" in `SegmentLocalCacheManager` noted in the problems section.  Where possible, the test code uses the same initialization logic as the core code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test changes\r\n- Added new tests in `SegmentLocalCacheManagerTest` and `SegmentManagerTest`.\r\n- Moved the existing tests from `SegmentLoaderTest` to `SegmentLocalCacheManagerTest`.\r\n- Added `TestSegmentUtils` for commonly used test utilities that has test implementation support for loading `DataSegment`, `Segment` factory, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Future work\r\n1. We can further simplify and cleanup these interactions by moving the functionality of `SegmentLoadDropHandler` to `SegmentManager` such that the announcements moves to the manager layer itself. That'll entail a slightly larger refactor.\r\n2. Cleanup the test code in `SegmentLocalCacheManagerTest`\r\n\r\nBoth of these require moderate to large refactoring changes, which can be tackled separately.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Description\r\n\r\nAdded new query context parameter `\"catalogValidationEnabled\"` to enable / disable catalog specific validation done on catalog defined tables in Druid. This property is enabled by default, meaning that validation is enabled. When disasbled, validation that would fail for incompatible type assignment, and adding new undefined columns to a sealed table are disabled. The decision was made to enable this property by default since if a user defines a table in the Druid catalog, then they are most likely wanting the validation that comes along with that.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThe task status API was improved in #15724 to serve task statuses from the Overlord memory.\r\nBut on older Overlord versions, this API would return an `unknown` task status location causing failures in inter-task communications.\r\n\r\nThis was later fixed in #16227 but that introduced another bug described below. This bug is typically reproducible in MSQ controller tasks but may occur in native batch ingestion as well.\r\n\r\n- The `SpecificTaskServiceLocator` first calls the multi-task status API `/druid/indexer/v1/taskStatus` to determine the location of a task.\r\n- This API returns an unknown task location on old Overlord versions\r\n- The `SpecificTaskServiceLocator` then falls back to calling the single task status API `/druid/indexer/v1/task/{taskId}/status`\r\n- The problem is that the second API is invoked in a synchronous manner in the callback of the first future while holding a lock\r\n- If there are enough MSQ workers, this could cause all the `ServiceClientFactory` threads to be stuck waiting to get back a task location. But to fetch the task location, we need one of the `ServiceClientFactory` threads.\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n- Invoke the single task status API in an async manner\r\n- Ensure that success/failure callbacks are quick and do not keep threads blocked\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nLocal setup to reproduce issue:\r\n- Build Druid on commit `f643abdad9` and run overlord, coordinator, broker\r\n- Build Druid on commit `f82cc34e5b` and run middle manager with 10 task slots\r\n- Submit a large MSQ query with 6 workers + 1 controller\r\n- Verify that controller remains stuck and doesn't make progress since all `ServiceClientFactory` threads are busy fetching task location\r\n\r\nLocal setup to verify fix:\r\n- Build Druid on commit `f643abdad9` and run overlord, coordinator, broker\r\n- Checkout Druid on commit `f82cc34e5b`\r\n- Apply the changes in this PR\r\n- Build Druid and run middle manager with 10 task slots\r\n- Submit a large MSQ query with 6 workers + 1 controller\r\n- Verify that the controller does not get stuck and live ingestion stats are reported as expected.","created_at":"2024-05-16T05:54:19Z","updated_at":"2024-05-20T07:32:11Z","closed_at":"2024-05-20T07:05:05Z","merged_at":"2024-05-20T07:05:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"15d27f340d68c9eb0a9d8e917f363b2c663035ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cryptoe","id":2260045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjAwNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2260045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe","html_url":"https://github.com/cryptoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/56","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/56","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/56/labels","id":10627755,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Aoiqr","number":56,"title":"30.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":359,"state":"closed","created_at":"2024-03-01T18:17:04Z","updated_at":"2024-07-30T08:21:14Z","due_on":"2024-05-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2024-06-18T06:02:52Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/16462/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/16462/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/16462/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/539088fc5c228e3bed3e54a953c382b8ab559ca4","head":{"label":"kfaraz:fix_task_location","ref":"fix_task_location","sha":"539088fc5c228e3bed3e54a953c382b8ab559ca4","user":{"login":"kfaraz","id":18635897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjM1ODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18635897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz","html_url":"https://github.com/kfaraz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355434171,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU0MzQxNzE=","name":"druid","full_name":"kfaraz/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kfaraz","id":18635897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjM1ODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18635897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz","html_url":"https://github.com/kfaraz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/use

href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases\">io.grpc:grpc-netty-shaded's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.64.0</h2>\n<h2>API Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>compiler: the option <code>jakarta_omit</code> was renamed <code>@generated=omit</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11086\">#11086</a>) (8a21afcc9)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>New API LoadBalancer.getChannelTarget() (4561bb5b8)</li>\n<li>opentelemetry: Publish new module grpc-opentelemetry (5ba1a5563). The feature is still missing documentation and an example. It only supports metrics; tracing and logs will be future enhancements. See <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A66-otel-stats.md\">gRFC A66</a></li>\n<li>bazel: Add support for bzlmod (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11046\">#11046</a>) (d1890c0ac)</li>\n<li>bazel: Replace usages of the old compatibility maven targets with <code>@maven</code> targets (00649913b)</li>\n<li>okhttp: Support serverBuilder.maxConcurrentCallsPerConnection (Fixes <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11062\">#11062</a>). (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11063\">#11063</a>) (805072339)</li>\n<li>xds: Experimental metrics recording in WRR LB (06df25b65, 35a171bc1, 2897b3939), to be exported by grpc-opentelemetry if explicitly enabled in GrpcOpenTelemetry. See <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A78-grpc-metrics-wrr-pf-xds.md\">gRFC A78</a></li>\n<li>rls: Experimental metrics recording in RLS LB (a9fb272b7, a1d19327f, 813331837), to be exported by grpc-opentelemetry if explicitly enabled in GrpcOpenTelemetry</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>examples: support bazel build for retry policy example (58de563fa)</li>\n<li>netty: Allow deframer errors to close stream with a status code, as long as headers have not yet been sent (e036b1b19). This will greatly improve the debuggability of certain server errors in particular cases. Instead of the client seeing “CANCELLED: RST_STREAM closed stream. HTTP/2 error code: CANCEL”, they could see “RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: gRPC message exceeds maximum size 4194304: 6144592”</li>\n<li>netty: Improve handling of unexpected write queue promise failures (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11016\">#11016</a>)</li>\n<li>servlet: Avoid unnecessary FINEST hex string conversion by checking log level. Fixes <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11031\">#11031</a>. (f7ee5f318)</li>\n<li>StatusException/StatusRuntimeException hide stack trace in a simpler way (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11064\">#11064</a>) (e36f099be)</li>\n<li>util: Status desc for outlier detection ejection (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11036\">#11036</a>) (10cb4a3be)</li>\n<li>binder: Helper class to allow in process servers to use peer uids in test (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11014\">#11014</a>) (537dbe826)</li>\n<li>Add <code>load()</code> statements for the Bazel builtin top-level java symbols (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11105\">#11105</a>) (add8c37a4)</li>\n<li>Add <code>StatusProto.toStatusException</code> overload to accept <code>Throwable</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11083\">#11083</a>) (5c9b49231)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix retry race condition that can lead to double decrementing inFlightSubStreams and so miss calling closed (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11026\">#11026</a>) (bdb623031)</li>\n<li>Change defaults to use the older PickFirstLoadBalancer and disable Happy Eyeballs.  This disables a performance optimization added in v1.63. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11120\">#11120</a>) We have had a report that the new implementation can trigger a NullPointerException</li>\n<li>core: Transition to CONNECTING immediately when exiting idle (2c5f0c22c). Previously the visible state change from <code>channel.getState()</code> was delayed until the name resolver returned results. This had no impact to RPC behavior</li>\n<li>xds: Specify a locale for upper/lower case conversions (e6305930d)</li>\n<li>rls: Synchronization fixes in CachingRlsLbClient (6e97b180b). These races had not been witnessed in practice</li>\n<li>rls: Guarantee backoff will update RLS picker (f9b6e5f92). This fixes a regression introduced by 6e97b180b that could hang RPCs instead of using fallback, but fixes a pre-existing bug that could greatly delay RPCs from using fallback.</li>\n<li>rls: Fix time handling in CachingRlsLbClient (da619e2bd). This could have caused backoff entries to improperly be considered expired</li>\n<li>xds: Properly disable the default endpoint identification algorithm with XdsChannelCredentials (097a46b76). The credential does its own verification and the default needs to be disabled for SPIFFE</li>\n<li>netty: Release SendGrpcFrameCommand when stream is missing (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11116\">#11116</a>) (fb9a10809)</li>\n<li>okhttp: Remove finished stream even if a pending stream was started (d21fe32be)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dependencies</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>cronet: Update Cronet to latest release + Move to Stable Cronet APIs.
