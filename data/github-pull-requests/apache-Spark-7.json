What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces a new configurable idle timeout feature for the Spark Connect server. Specifically, it adds a configuration option (`spark.connect.server.idleTimeout`) that allows administrators to specify a duration after which the Spark Connect server will automatically shut down if no new sessions or requests are received. By default, this value is set to 0 (disabled), preserving current behavior.\r\nWhen enabled (i.e., set to a positive value), the Spark Connect service periodically checks for activity based on recorded session access times. If the server remains idle beyond the configured timeout, it triggers a graceful shutdown of the service.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, the Spark Connect server remains running indefinitely until manually terminated. In managed environments (e.g., Amazon EMR), the lack of a natural stopping condition means the cluster may never be marked as idle and thus never shut down, leading to unnecessary resource consumption and cost.\r\nBy introducing this idle timeout:\r\n1. Clusters can automatically terminate when no active Spark Connect sessions are ongoing, leading to better resource utilization.\r\n2. Administrators have more control over lifecycle management, improving operational efficiency in hosted or on-demand environments.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n**Yes**. A new configuration parameter `spark.connect.server.idleTimeout` is introduced. When set to a positive duration (e.g., 10m), the Spark Connect server will monitor inactivity and stop after the specified period with no requests or active sessions.\r\nBy default, it is disabled (0).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added unit tests for PySpark\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-20T00:47:30Z","updated_at":"2024-12-22T02:14:44Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f38d8b4edf67b58264dedf0eb15fbff655819a0d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49249/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49249/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49249/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ca0a22c8d10d484f9cf40a55441e9ed99983f876","head":{"label":"soumasish:spark-50613","ref":"spark-50613","sha":"ca0a22c8d10d484f9cf40a55441e9ed99983f876","user":{"login":"soumasish","id":8686095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODYwOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8686095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish","html_url":"https://github.com/soumasish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":146815011,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDY4MTUwMTE=","name":"spark","full_name":"soumasish/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"soumasish","id":8686095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODYwOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8686095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish","html_url":"https://github.com/soumasish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/soumasish/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes GROUP BY ordinal support for pipe SQL AGGREGATE operators.\r\n\r\nIt adds a new `UnresolvedPipeAggregateOrdinal` expression to represent these ordinals. In this context, the ordinal refers to the one-based position of the column in the input relation. Note that this behavior is different from GROUP BY ordinals in regular SQL, wherein the ordinal refers to the one-based position of the column in the SELECT clause instead.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect 3 as x, 4 as y, 5 as z\r\n|> aggregate sum(y) group by 2, 3\r\n\r\n> 4, 5, 4\r\n\r\nselect 3 as x, 4 as y, 5 as z\r\n|> aggregate sum(y) group by 1, 2, 3\r\n\r\n> 3, 4, 5, 4\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR also makes a small fix for `|> UNION` (and other set operations) to prefer future pipe operators to apply on the result of the entire union, rather than binding to the right leg of the union only (to allay reported confusion during testing). For example, `values (0, 1) s(x, y) |> union all values (2, 3) t(x, y) |> drop x` will succeed rather than report an error that the number of columns does not match.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current implementation has a bug where the ordinals are sometimes mistakenly retained as literal integers.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new golden file based test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-12-20T00:04:56Z","updated_at":"2024-12-23T04:54:09Z","closed_at":"2024-12-23T04:54:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7f27d70b1200b15048244db01eb07ca3f63567aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49248/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49248/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49248/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/92db9ade816812389c635300448c383ff5d50cd6","head":{"label":"dtenedor:group-by-ordinals-pipe-aggregate","ref":"group-by-ordinals-pipe-aggregate","sha":"92db9ade816812389c635300448c383ff5d50cd6","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":592933002,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1dwig","name":"spark","full_name":"dtenedor/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis RP improves auto-generated expression aliases with pipe SQL operators.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the pipe SQL syntax query:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntable t\r\n|> extend 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nPreviously, the analyzed plan was:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProject [x#x, y#x, pipeexpression(1, false, EXTEND) AS pipeexpression(1)#x]\r\n+- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.t\r\n   +- Relation spark_catalog.default.t[x#x,y#x] csv\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, it is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProject [x#x, y#x, pipeexpression(1, false, EXTEND) AS 1#x]\r\n+- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.t\r\n   +- Relation spark_catalog.default.t[x#x,y#x] csv\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the output aliases visible in the resulting DataFrame for the query derive from the `AS <alias>` part of the analyzed plans shown.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis improves the user experience with pipe SQL syntax.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting golden file tests update to show the improved aliases.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSpark delays the table lookup error as other rules (can be third-party) may be able to resolve the table later. But this has 2 problems today:\r\n- it swallows table lookup errors from the catalog if the error is `NoSuchTableException` or `NoSuchDatabaseException`. At the end, `CheckAnalysis` always throws `NoSuchTableException` for `UnresolvedRelation`.\r\n- for other table lookup errors, Spark eagerly fails the query, and other analyzer rules have no chance to try.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to cache the table lookup error as a `TreeNodeTag` in `UnresolvedRelation`, so that we can throw the original table lookup error in `CheckAnalysis`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nimprove error message and make analyzer more extensible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIntroduces two logical nodes:\r\n - `UnresolvedDataSource`\r\n\r\nThe DataFrameReader and DataStreamReader creates these unresolved nodes instead, and calls the analyzer to resolve these data sources. These then get analyzed as part of the `ResolveDataSource` rule. All logic in DataFrameReader and DataStreamReader has been moved here.\r\n\r\nThere is still logic around text based format parsing on an existing Dataset. I will refactor this in a subsequent PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe DataFrameReader and DataStreamReader typically creates analyzed relations as part of their respective `.load()` methods.\r\n\r\nThis creates inconsistencies for what rules get applied to the query plan as part of Catalyst depending on your API of choice, such as SQL vs Python or SQL vs Scala.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this Jira is to refactor the logic in DataFrameReader and DataStreamReader classes to create unresolved plans that get analyzed as part of Catalyst.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests and will add new tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improve type coercion and boundary checking for UNIFORM SQL function.\r\n\r\n@srielau found the following issues and wrote them down in SPARK-50561:\r\n* TINYINT and BIGINT and DECIMAL types were not supported.\r\n* No type coercion from floating-point numbers was implemented.\r\n* No explicit error checking for negative numbers was implemented, resulting in weird stacktraces instead.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the above problems to make the function work in more cases and produce better error messages when it fails.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT uniform(cast(10 as decimal(10, 3)), cast(20 as decimal(10, 3)), 0.0D) AS result;\r\n> 17.605\r\n\r\nSELECT uniform(-20L, -10L, 0) AS result\r\n> -12\r\n\r\nSELECT uniform(0, cast(10 as tinyint), 0) AS result\r\n> 7\r\n\r\nSELECT uniform(0, cast(10 as bigint), 0) AS result\r\n> 7\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds golden file based test coverage, and updates existing coverage.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-12-18T23:36:17Z","updated_at":"2025-01-13T02:24:12Z","closed_at":"2025-01-09T05:16:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"99f6e65d072a6884c34fee84093bf3ca7ac972d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49237/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49237/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49237/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7426ba5d5eeed2b965f601d55053a5654ba2fca5","head":{"label":"dtenedor:fix-uniform-types","ref":"fix-uniform-types","sha":"7426ba5d5eeed2b965f601d55053a5654ba2fca5","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":592933002,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1dwig","name":"spark","full_name":"dtenedor/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs part of [SPARK-44145](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44145), a callback was added to track completion of analysis and optimization phase of a query. While the analyzed plan is sent when analysis completes successfully it does not when it fail. In that case, we should fallback to the ParsedPlan.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe purpose of the analyze event is to track when analysis completes, as such it should also be sent on both success & failure. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-18T23:30:36Z","updated_at":"2025-01-04T00:44:36Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49236/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49236/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49236/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/18e93660f401c9b73f037f3b63217aad44b3550d","head":{"label":"jdesjean:SPARK-50600","ref":"SPARK-50600","sha":"18e93660f401c9b73f037f3b63217aad44b3550d","user":{"login":"jdesjean","id":7377103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzcxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7377103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean","html_url":"https://github.com/jdesjean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":648429440,"node_id":"R_kgDOJqY_gA","name":"spark","full_name":"jdesjean/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jdesjean","id":7377103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzcxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7377103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean","html_url":"https://github.com/jdesjean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jdesjean/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt adds an optimizer rule to push variant into scan by rewriting the variant type with a struct type producing all requested fields and rewriting the variant extraction expressions by struct accesses. This will be the foundation of the variant shredding reader. The rule must be disabled at this point because the scan part is not yet able to recognize the special struct.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt is necessary for the performance of reading from shredded variant. With this rule (and the reader implemented), the scan only needs to fetch the necessary shredded columns required by the plan.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

Currently, the only way to enable shredding is through a SQLConf that provides the schema to use for shredding. This doesn't make sense as a user API, and is added only for testing. The exact API for Spark to determine a shredding schema is still TBD, but likely candidates are to infer it at the task level by inspecting the first few rows of data, or add an API to specify the schema for a given column. Either way, the code in this PR would basically be unchanged, it would just use a different mechanism to provide the schema.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nNeeded for Variant shredding

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe existing CSV DataSource allows one to set the delimiter/separator but does not allow the changing of the file extension. This means that a file can have values separated by tabs but me marked as a \".csv\" file. This change allows one to change the file extension to match the delimiter/separator (e.g. \".tsv\" for a tab separated value file).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR adds an additional option to set the fileExtension. The end result is that when a separator is set that is not a comma that the output file has a file extension that matches the separator (e.g. file.tsv, file.psv, etc...).\r\n\r\nNotes on Previous Pull Request https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17973 \r\nA pull request adding this option was discussed 7 years ago. One reason it wasn't added was:\r\n\"I would like to suggest to leave this out if there is no better reason for now. Downside of this is, it looks this allows arbitrary name and it does not gurantee the extention is, say, tsv when the delmiter is a tab. It is purely up to the user.\"\r\n\r\nI don't believe this is a good reason to not let the user set the extension. If we let them set the delimiter/separator to an arbitrary string/char then why not let the user also set the file extension to specify the separator that the file uses (e.g. tsv, psv, etc...). This addition keeps the \"csv\" file extension as the default and has the benefit of allowing other separators to match the file extension.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. This PR adds one row to the options table for the CSV DataSource documentation to include the \"fileExtension\" option. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nOne unit test was added to validate a file is written with the new extension.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nNormalize ordering in the project list of an inner Project. For example, following two plans should be the same after normalization:\r\n```\r\nProject[col1]                                  Project[col1]\r\n:- Project[col1, col2]                         :- Project[col2, col1]\r\n```\r\nThis is because only the top most ordering matters for comparing plans and inner project list can be computed in a non-deterministic way (i.e. via `HashSet`/`HashMap`)\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor plan comparison in the single-pass resolver.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a new test suite.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn order to support schema evolution without a full rewrite, we are prepending each state row with a state schema ID, which we will use in subsequent changes to look up the schema that a row was written with. This change adds the encoding and decoding of this prefix through the StateRowPrefixEncoder. Right now, as we don't enable any schema evolution, all rows will have the same state schema ID, 0.\r\n\r\nThe StateRowPrefix has two optional parameters - columnFamilyId and stateSchemaId. When dealing with a state row, these are only expected to be specified (on read or write), if we are using column families, or an encoder that supports schema evolution (only Avro in this case). \r\nThis effectively means that for all existing operators, no schema ID is expected as we Spark 4.0 will be the first release with Avro support.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese changes are needed in order to support schema evolution when Avro is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test in RocksDBSuite to test all 4 prefix behaviors.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen reading parquet footers, we need to know the file length, by requesting hdfs namenode in executor side for each task. \r\n\r\n```\r\n// ParquetFooterReader.java\r\npublic static ParquetMetadata readFooter(Configuration configuration,\r\n    Path file, ParquetMetadataConverter.MetadataFilter filter) throws IOException {\r\n    return readFooter(HadoopInputFile.fromPath(file, configuration), filter);\r\n}\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\npublic static HadoopInputFile fromPath(Path path, Configuration conf) throws IOException {\r\n  FileSystem fs = path.getFileSystem(conf);\r\n  return new HadoopInputFile(fs, fs.getFileStatus(path), conf);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in fact, the file length is already known in driver side from `PartitionedFile`.  By pass down this, we can avoid lots of namenode requests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReduce hdfs namenode requests, optimize the latency\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-18T07:53:27Z","updated_at":"2024-12-18T13:27:00Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d27071e555c8aa1b1ee9b52374186de76787cfe4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49225/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49225/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49225/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f0567b36fba693f13d87308362b2ac7f68f7a178","head":{"label":"WangGuangxin:reduce_nn_call_in_parquet_reader","ref":"reduce_nn_call_in_parquet_reader","sha":"f0567b36fba693f13d87308362b2ac7f68f7a178","user":{"login":"WangGuangxin","id":1312321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTIzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1312321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin","html_url":"https://github.com/WangGuangxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163655040,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjM2NTUwNDA=","name":"spark","full_name":"WangGuangxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WangGuangxin","id":1312321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTIzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1312321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin","html_url":"https://github.com/WangGuangxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WangGuangxin/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nDon't override the user-provided `basePath` for streaming file source reads without globbing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14803 fixed an issue reading partition values for streaming file source reads without globbing, but it always overwrites the `basePath` option. If the user provides a custom `basePath` in this case, there can be a mismatch in partition schema from when the stream is loaded to when a batch is executed, causing errors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew UT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-12-18T01:43:44Z","updated_at":"2025-01-23T17:47:22Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3983af64a0154ad2a84a92922298b9c126b4e4ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nReplace a group of `lazy val` in `QueryPlan` with new lock-free helper classes.\r\nNot all `lazy val`s are replaced in this PR, we will need to handle remaining `lazy val`s together with its subclasses to make it take effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nfor the deadlock issues on query plan nodes:\r\n\r\n- sometimes we want the plan node methods to use a coarse lock (just lock the plan node itself), as these methods (expressions , output , references , deterministic , schema , canonicalized , etc.) may call each other, so using a coarse lock can prevent deadlocks.\r\n- sometimes we want these methods to use fine-grained locks, because these methods may call each other of a parent/child plan node. If you traverse the tree with different directions at the same time, it's likely to hit deadlock using coarse lock.\r\n\r\nthe only solution is to not use locks if possible\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests\r\nManually test against a deadlock case\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

  ### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTruncate(col, len) partition transform is not supported in SPJ.\r\n\r\nIt seems for transforms with literal args, support was added for write distribution and ordering in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37749 but somehow storage-partition join does not support it despite the comment in :  https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/main/spark/v3.5/spark/src/test/java/org/apache/iceberg/spark/sql/TestStoragePartitionedJoins.java#L129 \r\n\r\nThis change extends SPJ support to transforms where there is a singular column reference attribute and other literal attributes.  Note, it seems bucket (another instance of this) is supported in SPJ via another mechanism, by having an explicit BucketTransform, but not sure it is necessary here.\r\n\r\n  ### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA join between tables partitioned by truncate transform, on the partition column, do not benefit from skipping shuffle.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n  ### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit test in KeyGroupedPartitioningSuite\r\n\r\n\r\n  ### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improve type coercion and boundary checking for RANDSTR SQL function.\r\n\r\n@srielau found the following issues and wrote them down in SPARK-50560:\r\n* TINYINT and BIGINT were not supported.\r\n* No type coercion from floating-point numbers was implemented.\r\n* No explicit error checking for negative numbers was implemented, resulting in weird stacktraces instead.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the above problems to make the function work in more cases and produce better error messages when it fails.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT randstr(CAST(10 AS TINYINT), 0) AS result\r\n> ceV0PXaR2I\r\n\r\nSELECT randstr(CAST(10 AS BIGINT), 0) AS result\r\n> ceV0PXaR2I\r\n\r\nSELECT randstr(1.0F, 0) AS result\r\n> c\r\n\r\nSELECT randstr(1.0D, 0) AS result\r\n> c\r\n\r\nSELECT randstr(-1, 0) AS result\r\n> Error: The RANDSTR function desired string length must be positive or zero. Please provide an updated string length and then retry the query or command again.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this

side join key on non partition columns\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nOn the lines of DPP which helps DataSourceV2 relations when the joining key is a partition column, the same concept can be extended over to the case where joining key is not a partition column. In this PR, the keys available in the BroadcastHashJoinExec are pushed down to the DataSourceV2 scans in form of a SortedSet structure. For non partition columns, the DataSources like iceberg have max/min stats on columns available at manifest level, and for formats like parquet , they have max/min stats at various data structure levels. The passed SortedSet can be used to prune using ranges at both driver level ( manifests files) as well as executor level ( while actually going through chunks , row groups etc at parquet level)\r\nIf the data is stored as Columnar Batch format , then it would not be possible to filter out individual row at DataSource level, even though we have keys. But at the scan level, ( ColumnToRowExec) it is still possible to filter out as many rows as possible , if the query involves nested joins. Thus reducing the number of rows to join at the higher join levels.\r\nAttaching link to a presentation which outlines the idea: [Broadcast Keys pushdown](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/165Rx7i00TmAKnDJpSQLfrcrW-ShrzPy5/edit?usp=drive_link)\r\nSPIP : [SPIP-44662](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44662)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere is scope of improvement in the performance of Inner and Left Semi join queries when using BroadcastHashJoin\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRan TPCDS suite using iceberg as DataSource. Converted many of the existing Spark Query tests to also run using iceberg as data source. Will be adding more unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSee description. Previously, it was a pain to reorder batches and guard behavior of certain batches / sequences of batches by a flag. This was primarily due to ample usage of `::`, `:::`, and `:+` to juggle rules and batches around which imposed syntactic limitations.\r\n\r\nAfter this change, we keep a single sequence `allBatches`, that can contain either `Batch` or `Seq[Batch]` elements to allow further groupings, which is later flattened into a single `Seq[Batch]`. \r\n\r\nWe avoid any usage of `::`, `:::`, and `:+`.\r\n\r\nTo add/replace a flag-guarded batch of sequence of batches, write a function that returns either `Batch` of `Seq[Batch]` with desired behavior, and add/replace in the relevant place in the `allBatches` list.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis simplifies further restructuring and reordering of batches.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSimplify org.apache.spark.sql.connect.execution.ReattachableExecuteSuite.\"reattach after connection expired\" to make it more deterministic.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe test previously involved execution and interruption that made the test unnecessarily flaky, e.g., an exception was thrown when releasing the corresponding [execution](https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/12296721038/job/34316344940), not when reattaching the execution.\r\n- The test's sole purpose is to check whether the lack of 'session' results in the correct error code.\r\n- The involvement of actual query execution only makes the test flaky and complicated.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRepeatedly ran testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.connect.execution.ReattachableExecuteSuite.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-16T10:28:50Z","updated_at":"2024-12-26T00:15:03Z","closed_at":"2024-12-17T11:12:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f9f8dd175f91df5d7b97802a8eb08c29649613fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49203/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49203/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49203/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c74f530047a5309848a9784b18c4f553a56ccd7a","head":{"label":"changgyoopark-db:SPARK-50510","ref":"SPARK-50510","sha":"c74f530047a5309848a9784b18c4f553a56ccd7a","user":{"login":"changgyoopark-db","id":164183463,"node_id":"U_kgDOCck9pw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164183463?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db","html_url":"https://github.com/changgyoopark-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":802238067,"node_id":"R_kgDOL9Eucw","name":"spark","full_name":"changgyoopark-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"changgyoopark-db","id":164183463,"node_id":"U_kgDOCck9pw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164183463?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db","html_url":"https://github.com/changgyoopark-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/changgyoopark-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFirst of all, when pushing down through Project and Aggregate, use With to rewrite non-cheap common expr instead of inline. This is equivalent to pushing down Filter and Project together.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if the project is actually created in the end, there may be a risk of regression (some rules cannot match the filter using PhysicalOperation). so PushPredicateThroughProject is added after rewrite With, which uses the cost model to determine whether to push the predicate down through the project generated by With.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. Avoid nested expansion of filters expression causing execution plans to become too large. \r\n2. Avoid duplicate expensive expressions for better performance\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to use CommonJS format for ESLint configuration file instead of JSON format.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCommonJS format is just plain JavaScript so we can add comments to the configuration file.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTemporarily modified some `.js` files and ran `dev/lint-js`, then the linter detected violations.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThese changes ensure that TWS state variables treat `numRowsRemoved` as a physical metric representing the number of entries that they cleared out of the state store in response to TTL expiry, or a user action like `clear()`.\r\n\r\nNote: `numRowsRemoved`, with these changes, does not track every single _deletion_ to RocksDB. For example, if we delete a row and then re-insert it, we don't count that as a removal. A removal is just about the number of records removed due to TTL expiry or a user clearing it.\r\n\r\nAlso, we were only using the count index to populate the `numRowsRemoved` metric; now that this metric is all physical, we don't need the count index.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current metrics are confusing. `numRowsRemoved` is hard to reconcile with `numTotalRows`; today it's even possible for the sum of `numRowsRemoved` across batches to be greater than `numTotalRows`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but just with metrics.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified existing metrics in UTs to have the new behavior, and added more logic (and assertions) to all the suites to test the new behavior.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nGithub Copilot\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-16T04:22:07Z","updated_at":"2024-12-19T09:06:04Z","closed_at":"2024-12-19T03:05:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fe0df691881f071bd0b4e1e19f3c43a4c31b3c7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to respect the `maxFields` argument of `SparkStringUtils.truncatedString` in all cases independently from the size of the another argument `seq`. If size of `seq` is grater or equal to `maxFields`, output exact `maxFields` elements of `seq`.\r\n\r\nAlso, if the number of printed elements is zero, don't print the redundant comma `,` like `[, ... 100 more fields]`, and don't overflow when `maxFields` is `Int.MinValue`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make output consistent for the same `maxFields`. For example, if `maxFields` is 2:\r\n```scala\r\ntruncatedString(Seq(1, 2), \"[\", \", \", \"]\", maxFields = 2) -> \"[1, 2]\"\r\n```\r\nbut for more elements in the input sequence, it prints only one element:\r\n```scala\r\ntruncatedString(Seq(1, 2, 3), \"[\", \", \", \"]\", maxFields = 2) -> \"[1, ... 2 more fields]\"\r\n```\r\nthough the expected output is **\"[1, 2, ... 1 more fields]\"**.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing tests from `UtilSuite` that are moved to `StringUtilsSuite` and additional checks:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *StringUtilsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-12-14T13:12:12Z","updated_at":"2024-12-16T06:04:50Z","closed_at":"2024-12-16T06:04:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6197f8f51dfcca2f1b227334c0f6e71e4d402723","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49187/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49187/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49187/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/01c07541beee7329b70b6bc2308ea6aa1fc34f9c","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-truncatedString","ref":"fix-truncatedString","sha":"01c07541beee7329b70b6bc2308ea6aa1fc34f9c","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new SQL conf `OPTIMIZER_INSET_MEMBER_LOGGING_LIMIT` that allows to limit the number of elements logged for In and InSet in toString. The current implementation does log arbitrarily many elements and in the case of InSet even sorts them before, which can lead to a lot of unwanted log volumes and have significant performance impact.\r\nIf clients require all elements, they can set to conf to a very high value or preferably use the `sql` function.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nI have observed performance impact of the logging\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nTeh logging string changes. Given that there is also the `sql` function, clients should not depend on the output of the logging function.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests have been added\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn order to support schema evolution without a full rewrite, we are prepending each state row with a state schema ID, which we will use in subsequent changes to look up the schema that a row was written with. This change adds state schema IDs to both key and value rows in order to enable schema evolution when Avro is enabled.\r\nFor NoPrefixKeys and Values, the state schema ID is prepended to the row. \r\nFor PrefixKeys and RangeKeys, the state schema ID is prepended to the remaining portion of the key (so the format is prefix key, schema ID, remaining key)\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese changes are needed in order to support schema evolution when Avro is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test in RocksDBSuite to test all 4 prefix behaviors.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nStore `Except`, `Intersect` and `Union`'s outputs as lazy vals.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently `Union`'s (same is for `Except` and `Intersect`) `output` is a `def`. This creates performance issues for queries with large number of stacked `UNION`s because of rules like `WidenSetOperationTypes` that traverse the logical plan and call `output` on each `Union` node. This has quadratic complexity: O(number_of_unions * (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + number_of_unions)).\r\n\r\nProfile:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97192bf3-c38e-47dd-81ac-49ee9a546525)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68ed13d7-b108-4c8d-b156-1dcec07c324b)\r\n\r\n[flamegraph.tar.gz](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18118260/flamegraph.tar.gz)\r\n\r\nThe improvement in parsing + analysis wall-clock time for a query with 500 UNIONs over 30 columns each is 13x (5.5s -> 400ms):\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a824c693-0a6b-4c6b-8a90-a783a3c44d6d)\r\n\r\nRepro:\r\n```\r\ndef genValues(num: Int) = s\"VALUES (${(0 until num).mkString(\", \")})\"\r\ndef genUnions(numUnions: Int, numValues: Int) = (0 until numUnions).map(_ => genValues(numValues)).mkString(\" UNION ALL \")\r\nspark.time { spark.sql(s\"SELECT * FROM ${genUnions(numUnions = 500, numValues = 30)}\").queryExecution.analyzed }\r\n```\r\n\r\n For `EXCEPT` the perf difference is not that noticeable. Perhaps because it reuses the same `Seq` (it just calls `left.output`).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is an optimization.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Ran the async-profiler\r\n- Ran the benchmark in spark-shell.\r\n- Existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\ncopilot.nvim.","created_at":"2024-12-12T22:46:33Z","updated_at":"2024-12-14T15:50:06Z","closed_at":"2024-12-14T15:50:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"439b1e01fab93a4754cda501f41892160c05fcc7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49166/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49166/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49166/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c0f5ae8db2241b26f76931a5af6a7473c3c72075","head":{"label":"vladimirg-db:vladimirg-db/store-union-output-as-lazy-val","ref":"vladimirg-db/store-union-output-as-lazy-val","sha":"c0f5ae8db2241b26f76931a5af6a7473c3c72075","user":{"login":"vladimirg-db","id":166514719,"node_id":"U_kgDOCezQHw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166514719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db","html_url":"https://github.com/vladimirg-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":833519707,"node_id":"R_kgDOMa6AWw","name":"spark","full_name":"vladimirg-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vladimirg-db","id":166514719,"node_id":"U_kgDOCezQHw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166514719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db","html_url":"https://github.com/vladimirg-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vladimirg-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis was missed when the default value of configuration is changed via the following.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38306\r\n\r\nKafkaMicroBatchSourceSuite consists of set of different suites, where KafkaMicroBatchSourceSuiteBase based suite is defined. There are 4 implementations of this abstract class for now:\r\n  1. `KafkaMicroBatchV1SourceSuite` - V1 source that supposes to use `KafkaOffsetReaderConsumer` as `KafkaOffsetReader`.\r\n  2. `KafkaMicroBatchV2SourceSuite` - V2 source that supposes to use `KafkaOffsetReaderConsumer` as `KafkaOffsetReader`.\r\n  3. `KafkaMicroBatchV1SourceWithAdminSuite` - V1 source that uses `KafkaOffsetReaderAdmin` as `KafkaOffsetReader`.\r\n  4. `KafkaMicroBatchV2SourceWithAdminSuite` - V2 source that uses `KafkaOffsetReaderAdmin` as `KafkaOffsetReader`.\r\nBut `KafkaMicroBatchV1SourceSuite` and `KafkaMicroBatchV2SourceSuite` are still running based on `KafkaOffsetReaderAdmin`, as `USE_DEPRECATED_KAFKA_OFFSET_FETCHING` is `false` be default. By switching it to `true` in `beforeAll`, we make sure that corresponding `KafkaOffsetReader` is in use.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  6. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo improve unit tests coverage for `KafkaOffsetReaderConsumer`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit Tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for
