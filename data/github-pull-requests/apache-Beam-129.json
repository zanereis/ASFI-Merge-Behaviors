enabling the strict dependencies on all Java modules is a large and critical change to be merged all at once. Therefore, task [[BEAM-10961](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10961)] is divided into sub-tasks and strict dependencies are enabled to each module separately which is comparatively easy to review and merge.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

enabling the strict dependencies on all Java modules is a large and critical change to be merged all at once. Therefore, task [[BEAM-10961](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10961)] is divided into sub-tasks and strict dependencies are enabled to each module separately which is comparatively easy to review and merge.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

enabling the strict dependencies on all Java modules is a large and critical change to be merged all at once. Therefore, task [[BEAM-10961](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10961)] is divided into sub-tasks and strict dependencies are enabled to each module separately which is comparatively easy to review and merge.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

This PR removes restriction on pandas to allow upgrade to 1.2.0 and 1.2.1.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there was a new breakage in pandas 1.2.1 caused by https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/39474. So this PR includes a couple of other changes:\r\n- Skips affected test when run with 1.2.1\r\n- Removes special handling for pandas 0.x, we already opted not to support it.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests

enabling the strict dependencies on all Java modules is a large and critical change to be merged all at once. Therefore, task [[BEAM-10961](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10961)] is divided into sub-tasks and strict dependencies are enabled to each module separately which is comparatively easy to review and merge.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

enabling the strict dependencies on all Java modules is a large and critical change to be merged all at once. Therefore, task [[BEAM-10961](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10961)] is divided into sub-tasks and strict dependencies are enabled to each module separately which is comparatively easy to review and merge.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

enabling the strict dependencies on all Java modules is a large and critical change to be merged all at once. Therefore, task [[BEAM-10961](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10961)] is divided into sub-tasks and strict dependencies are enabled to each module separately which is comparatively easy to review and merge.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

enabling the strict dependencies on all Java modules is a large and critical change to be merged all at once. Therefore, task [[BEAM-10961](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10961)] is divided into sub-tasks and strict dependencies are enabled to each module separately which is comparatively easy to review and merge.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

enabling the strict dependencies on all Java modules is a large and critical change to be merged all at once. Therefore, task [[BEAM-10961](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10961)] is divided into sub-tasks and strict dependencies are enabled to each module separately which is comparatively easy to review and merge.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

enabling the strict dependencies on all Java modules is a large and critical change to be merged all at once. Therefore, task [[BEAM-10961](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10961)] is divided into sub-tasks and strict dependencies are enabled to each module separately which is comparatively easy to review and merge.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

enabling the strict dependencies on all Java modules is a large and critical change to be merged all at once. Therefore, task [[BEAM-10961](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10961)] is divided into sub-tasks and strict dependencies are enabled to each module separately which is comparatively easy to review and merge.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

enabling the strict dependencies on all Java modules is a large and critical change to be merged all at once.

enabling the strict dependencies on all Java modules is a large and critical change to be merged all at once. Therefore, task [[BEAM-10961](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10961)] is divided into sub-tasks and strict dependencies are enabled to each module separately which is comparatively easy to review and merge.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR does two things.\r\n1. It removes the timestamp from the sdk.properties file.\r\n2. This doesn't ignore the `sdk.properties` anymore for the purposes of the runtime classpath. This means that the tests will rerun when the versions change.\r\n\r\nThis PR assumes that [there is no need for the timestamp in the sdk.properties](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/13597#issuecomment-750423282). If there is such a need, the other option to resolve this issue is to wait until Gradle 6.8 is released which will have the ability to ignore specific properties [such as the timestamp](https://docs.gradle.org/6.8-rc-3/release-notes.html#more-cache-hits-for-tasks-with-runtime-classpaths) in the sdk.properties file.\r\n\r\nSee the discussion on [the PR](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/13597) for more information.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/13597 and https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/13600 and solves BEAM-11512\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

enabling the strict dependencies on all Java modules is a large and critical change to be merged all at once.

test for [Kafka to Pub/Sub](https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/examples/java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/examples/complete/kafkatopubsub) pipeline example.\r\n\r\nThis test initializes Apache Kafka and Google Cloud Pub/Sub Emulator using Testcontainers [Kafka](https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/kafka/) and [GCloud](https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/gcloud/) modules respectively. After that we publish a message to Kafka topic and wait for it to appear in Pub/Sub topic. If message is not received in 2 minutes test fails.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

facing an exception telling me that my JavaBean contained a setter for a field that had a mismatching nullable attribute, although both getter and setter (parameters) are annotated with `@Nullable` (`org.apache.avro.reflect.Nullable`).\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@DefaultSchema(JavaBeanSchema.class)\r\npublic final class SampleBean {\r\n\r\n    @Nullable\r\n    private Float value;\r\n\r\n    public @Nullable Float getValue() {\r\n        return value;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setValue(@Nullable Float value) {\r\n        this.value = value;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code responsible for determining if a setter's parameter is nullable looks wrong to me, since it ~~does check if the type (class) itself is annotated with `@Nullable` instead of checking the actual parameter's annotations.~~ only considers type annotations instead of looking at parameter annotations, too. Java distinguishes between parameter annotations and type annotations. Therefore annotations declared without `java.lang.annotation.ElementType#TYPE_USE` can't be accessed through `Executable#getAnnotatedParameterTypes()`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

engineers encounter times when schema of Parquet file is unknown at the time of writing the pipeline or multiple schema may be present in different files.  Reading Parquet files using ParquetIO requires providing an Avro (equivalent) schema, Many a times its not possible to know the schema of the Parquet files.\r\nOn the other hand [AvroIO](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/2.26.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/AvroIO.html) supports reading unknow schema files by providing a parse function : `#parseGenericRecords(SerializableFunction<GenericRecord,T>)`\r\n\r\nSupporting this functionality in ParquetIO is simple and requires minimal changes to the ParquetIO surface.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
