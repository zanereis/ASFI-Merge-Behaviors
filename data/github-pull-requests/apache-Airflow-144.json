changed between Python 3.7 and 3.10 meaning that a limited\r\nparallelism LocalExecutor scheduler now doesn't shutdown cleanly on\r\nreceiving a signal.\r\n\r\nOn closer inspection of the limited vs unlimited path it apepars to me that\r\nthe code was \"over-generalized\" and the entire concept of `self.impl` has been\r\nremoved hopefully making this code much more direct and easier to understand.\r\n\r\nThe key things are now:\r\n\r\n- When a task needs to be run, we send the message on a mp.SimpleQueue object,\r\n  and increment an internal counter.\r\n\r\n  (We use our own counter, not qsize method as that is not portable)\r\n\r\n- Inside _check_workers we see if we think there are any outstanding messages,\r\n  and create a worker if there are.\r\n\r\n  The reason we do this is the on macOS (where the default mp start method is\r\n  \"spawn\") a process will be started via `exeucte_async`, but it will take a\r\n  second or two to pull the message of the queue, by which time the scheduler\r\n  will have called `executor.sync()` again, meaning we'd over create workers\r\n  (but never above the limit).\r\n\r\n  Avoiding that case is why we keep the internal `_outstanding_messages`\r\n  counter -- `self.activity_queue.empty()` would return False when the worker\r\n  is booting up.\r\n\r\n- Everytime the scheduler calls the `sync()` method we read out of the result\r\n  queue and decrement the internal counter.\r\n\r\n- We remove the entire use of `multiprocessing.Manager` -- it doesn't seem to\r\n  do anything other than create queue objects but for our use it just adds\r\n  complexity to understanding\r\n\r\n- Almost as a side-effect we now only create worker subprocesses on demand,\r\n  instead of pre-launching them.\r\n\r\n  We do not currently shut down idle processes, though adding it would be\r\n  quite straight forward if we wanted to in the future\r\n\r\nThis branch name was \"rewrite-local-exexc-concurrentfutures\" (sic) as when\r\noriginally opened in 2022 for 3.10 that was the plan.\r\n\r\nHowever since then 3.12 has come out and it now starts issuing warnings when\r\nFork and threads are used, and concurrent.futures uses a thread internally, so\r\na different approach was

small PR to suggest minor tweaks in the grid view UI.\r\n\r\nJust noticed that the `details button` was truncated on my side when the detail panel is hidden. Looking closer, it has an absolute position, and appears after the Grid component in the dom, making it hard to align with the AutoRefresh. Changed that to make it part of a common flex container with the `AutoRefresh`.\r\n\r\nAlso took the opportunity to add wrapping to the `LegendRow` for a more responsive UI.\r\n\r\n![image_buttton_issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14861206/170482035-e9704663-4ae7-4b6d-9aef-e3a2ce01f3e7.png)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

pull request adds two new SQL Check Operators to the core sql.py file, one called SQLColumnCheckOperator and one called SQLTableCheckOperator. Corresponding tests are added as well. The current functionality of these operators is minimal, but expected to grow over time. These operators, unlike current ones, save information about the results\r\nof the check queries that is then parseable by third party libraries.\r\n\r\ncloses:

there are string-value evaluations of `compute`, `nodegroup_role_arn`,  and `fargate_pod_execution_role_arn` args in the constructor of `EksCreateClusterOperator`.  These args are all listed as a template fields so it's entirely possible that the value(s) passed in to the operator is a Jinja expression or an `XComArg`. Either of these value types could cause a false-negative `ValueError` (in the case of unsupported `compute` values), false-positives (in the the cases of explicit checks for the *arn values), or other errors since the values themselves have not been rendered.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the evaluations of these args to the `execute()` scope.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

change should significantly speed up Breeze experience (and\r\nespecially iterating over a change in Breeze for MacOS users -\r\nindependently if you are using x86 or arm architecture.\r\n\r\nThe problem with MacOS with docker is particularly slow filesystem\r\nused to map sources from Host to Docker VM. It is particularly bad\r\nwhen there are multiple small files involved.\r\n\r\nThe improvement come from two areas:\r\n* removing duplicate pycache cleaning\r\n* moving MyPy cache to docker volume\r\n\r\nWhen entering breeze we are - just in case - cleaning .pyc and\r\n__pychache__ files potentially generated outside of the docker\r\ncontainer - this is particularly useful if you use local IDE\r\nand you do not have bytecode generation disabled (we have it\r\ndisabled in Breeze). Generating python bytecode might lead to\r\nvarious problems when you are switching branches and Python\r\nversions, so for Breeze development where the files change\r\noften anyway, disabling them and removing when they are found\r\nis important. This happens at entering breeze and it might take\r\na second or two depending if you have locally generated.\r\n\r\nIt could happen that __init script was called twice (depending which\r\nscript was called - therefore the time could be double the one\r\nthat was actually needed. Also if you ever generated provider\r\npackages, the time could be much longer, because node_modules\r\ngenerated in provider sources were not excluded from searching\r\n(and on MacOS it takes a LOT of time).\r\n\r\nThis also led to duplicate time of exit as the initialization code\r\ninstalled traps that were also run twice. The traps however were\r\nrather fast so had no negative influence on performance.\r\n\r\nThe change adds a guard so that initialization is only ever executed\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nSecond part of the change is moving the cache of mypy to a docker\r\nvolume rather than being used from local source folder (default\r\nwhen complete sources are mounted). We were already using selective\r\nmount to make sure MacOS filesystem slowness affects us in minimal\r\nway - but with this change, the cache will be stored in docker\r\nvolume that does not suffer from the same problems as mounting\r\nvolumes from host. The Docker volume is preserved until the\r\n`docker stop` command is run - which means that iterating over\r\na change should be WAY faster now - observed speed-up were around\r\n5x speedups for MyPy pre-commit.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

are a few actions in Breeze that might take more or less time\r\nwhen invoked. This is mostly when you need to upgrade Breeze or\r\nupdate to latest version of the image because some dependedncies\r\nwere added or image was modified.\r\n\r\nWhile we have improved significantly the waiting time involved\r\nnow (and caching problems have been fixed to make it as fast\r\npossible), there are still a few situations that you need to have\r\na good connectivity and a little time to run the upgrade. Which\r\nis often not something you would like to loose your time on in\r\na number of cases when you need to do things fast.\r\n\r\nUsually Breeeze does not force the user to perform such long\r\nactions - it allows to continue without doing them (either by\r\ntimeout or by letting user answer \"no\" to question asked.\r\n\r\nPreviously Breeze have not informed the user about the exepcted\r\ntime of running such operation, but with this change it tells\r\nwhat is the expected delay - thus allowing the user to make\r\ninformed action whether they want to run the upgrade or not.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

introduced directly navigating to a DAG when selecting one from the typeahead search results. Unfortunately, the search results also includes DAG owner names, and selecting one of those navigates to a DAG with that name, which almost certainly doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nThis extends the autocompletion endpoint to return the type of result, and adjusts the typeahead selection to use this to know which way to navigate.\r\n\r\nFixes #23670.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#23775 I noticed that there is yet another small improvement\r\narea in the CI buld speed. Currently build-ci-image builds and push\r\nonly \"commit-tagged\" images, but \"fix-ownership\" requires\r\nthe \"latest\" image to run. This PR adds --tag-as-latest option also\r\nto build-image and build-prod-image commands - similarly as for the\r\npull-image and pull-prod-image. This will retag the \"commit\" images\r\nas latest in the build-ci-images step and allow to save 1m on\r\npulling the latest image before fix-ownership (bringing it back\r\nto 1s overhead)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
