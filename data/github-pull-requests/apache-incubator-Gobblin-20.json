Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-334\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n  - Currently, setting or putting a `DatasetDescriptor` with `LineageInfo` creates a new `DatasetResolver` every time. It's not performant.\r\n  - The `SharedResourceFactory` (`LineageInfoFactory`) creates a single job level `LineageInfo` instance so that one job process creates only one `LineageInfo` object, hence only one `DatasetResolver` object. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n  - `LineageEventTest`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Move the tests to the group\ndisabledOnTravis to continue to disable it on Travis until we have\nhigher confidence with these tests.\nThis makes it easier to run these tests locally.\n\n* Run the setup and teardown methods per method.

hanging issue\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-308\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n         (1) Move jobCatalog.addListener to the specConsumer.startUp(). This will delay the original spec queuing logic (triggered by jobCatalog service startup) to the consumer startup. Earlier this will have an issue because specConsumer doesn't have a chance to run due to jobCatalog service startup pushes job spec to blocking queue and the whole thread was blocked there.\r\n         (2) StreamingJobConfigruationManager::startup() should launch the fetching thread before the consumer thread. This is important because now consumer startup will queuing job specs into a blocking queue. A fetching thread should be present before this queuing starts.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n   Local deployment test is done.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-07T22:32:03Z","updated_at":"2018-01-15T23:25:25Z","closed_at":"2017-11-08T00:35:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"56207be498e7da0e474b9ee92b654fa2cb4f18db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2162/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2162/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2162/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/0b85c85d32fa7ab4548b40cc28f3fe921ef3a3fe","head":{"label":"yukuai518:cluster-stuck","ref":"cluster-stuck","sha":"0b85c85d32fa7ab4548b40cc28f3fe921ef3a3fe","user":{"login":"yukuai518","id":22781248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzgxMjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22781248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518","html_url":"https://github.com/yukuai518","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70858734,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDg1ODczNA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"yukuai518/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yukuai518","id":22781248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzgxMjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22781248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518","html_url":"https://github.com/yukuai518","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukuai518/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yukuai518/gobblin","description":"Universal

For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-298\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n* Moved common code for gobblin.metrics.kafka to the gobblin-kafka-common module.\r\n* Added a `KafkaProducerPusher` in both the `gobblin-kafka-08` and `gobblin-kafka-09` modules that takes in a scoped config to configure a `KafkaProducer`. Kafka config such as ones required for SSL can be passed to the `KafkaProducer`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-297\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Changed access modifier to protected from private so that extending classes can easily override the required methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nOnly access modifier is changed. Hence testing is not required.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-287\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis appends a service name to a ThrottledFileSystem's resource key so that multiple throttling quotas can be applied instead of a single global quota. It also updates a test to validate that this effect takes place.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nIt modifies an existing test to get coverage of this new code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-288\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAdded refinement of the daily bucket histogram by splitting large buckets into smaller time ranges until a target size is reached. This is to avoid timeout errors when a partition is too large.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUpdated partitioning test and ran Salesforce Contact flow.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

errors\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-284\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n* Add retry to handle transient network errors. The BufferedReader is recreated to reconnect on before reattempting fetch. The Salesforce http connection is sometimes dropped from the server side, so this retry is required to avoid job failure.\r\n* Skip empty result sets since that can cause the job to terminate before pulling all data since returning a null record terminates the pull.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested with a read pull of the Contact table.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-283\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\nCurrent implementation of `EnvelopePayloadConverter` restricts some common logic, which can be used for converting other field, to convert only one payload. This PR is decouple those logic from one payload conversion\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nIt's a refactor, which can be covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Tested locally with Azkaban.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-276\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n1. Originally isActive=true is set after onAddSpec was invoked during the leadership change. However this has a problem because onAddSpec will forward a spec to new leader when isActive==false, but actually current node is already the new leader.\r\n2. Add  a countDownLatch variable to protect the topology being initialized before we load flow specs.\r\n3. Add synchronization for scheduleJob because multiple threads can process the same flowSpec and gobblin based JobScheduler is not threadsafe.\r\n4. Modify the order of topologyCatalog initialization. Move the topologyCatalog addListener after topologyFactory has updated the spec store. This will help prevent the incompatible topology capabilities \"any:any\" to be load which will break the Multihop compilation because weightedgraph today doesn't support a loop-back node.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  Rerun gobblin-service module tests. No new tests being added.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-273\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen a job failed with a very long log, it's not easy to dive into the log and find the reason of the failure. Here a reporter is plugin-ed into the Gobblin Metrics architecture to collect job failure events into a file. A job now has task level and dataset level failure events reported for free.\r\n#### `MetricContext#submitFailureEvent`\r\nWhen a failure event needs to be reported, it should be submitted with this method, which encapsulates the event into a `FailureEventNotification`\r\n#### `FileFailureEventReporter`\r\nReport all failure events into a file. Each job has its own report folder. \r\n#### Configurations\r\nTo enable job failure reporting, the following configurations are required\r\n```\r\nmetrics.enabled=true\r\nfs.uri=<file system uri> // by default, local file system is used\r\nfailure.log.dir=<root folder of all jobs failure reports>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests\r\n  - `FileFailureEventReporterTest`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-272\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nAvro extension was hardcoded in some place at Compaction and I just made it configurable to be more generic.\r\nYou can set it in your compaction config by:\r\n`\r\ncompaction.extension=gz\r\n`\r\n\r\nIt seems like the code style on these file was not the Gobblin style and that's why the change seems to be huge (or am I using the wrong codestyle?).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-265\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nAdd support for PK chunking. PK chunking is a Salesforce feature that allows automatic partitioning based on row ids. It is supported for the following objects: Account, Campaign, CampaignMember, Case, Contact, Lead, LoginHistory, Opportunity, Task, User, and custom objects. \r\n\r\nPK chunking is only allowed when dynamic and custom partitioning is not enabled.\r\n\r\nThis feature allows ingestion of a large number of rows without hitting the Salesforce query execution time limit.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNeeds access to real Salesforce system. Tested with a real flow.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

DataPublisher can indicate whether it has the THREADSAFE capability.\r\nIf the DataPublisher is threadsafe then the DataPublisherFactory will return a shareable ResourceInstance.\r\nIf the DataPublisher is not threadsafe then an ImmediatelyInvalidResourceEntry is returned to ensure\r\nthat the broker won't return the same publisher for a second request.\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-264\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAdds the following.\r\n* `ImmediatelyInvalidResourceEntry `- a ResourceInstance that is invalidated when getResource() is called. Immediate invalidation means it won't be returned as a response to a future get call.\r\n* `Capabilities` - a construct can implement the `CapabilityAware` interface to support queries on the capabilities it supports.\r\n* `Threadsafe` - this capability indicates that the `DataPublisher` is can be called concurrently in multiple threads.\r\n* `Reusable` - this capability indicates that the `DataPublisher` publish APIs can be invoked multiple times.\r\n* The `ParallelRunner` is made reusable by adding a method to change the FileSystem and a method to wait for submitted tasks to complete.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-22T17:59:48Z","updated_at":"2017-09-28T16:59:48Z","closed_at":"2017-09-28T16:59:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"38b0fa07a9a92fdee03c0586870e36145962989d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2116/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2116/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2116/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/677dd117944c88e80981f7a82035081c106e22d2","head":{"label":"htran1:shareable_publishers","ref":"shareable_publishers","sha":"677dd117944c88e80981f7a82035081c106e22d2","user":{"login":"htran1","id":23297947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjk3OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23297947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1","html_url":"https://github.com/htran1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":73107999,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MzEwNzk5OQ==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"htran1/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"htran1","id":23297947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjk3OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23297947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1","html_url":"https://github.com/htran1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/htran1/gobblin","description":"Universal

control messages\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-234\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n* Adds the `LiKafkaByteArrayMsgSchemaChangeInjector` control message injector to detect changes to the latest avro schema registered for the topic.\r\n* This injector maintains a cache of the schema ids it has seen. When a record's schema id is not found in the cache then the latest schema is fetched from the schema registry to check whether it has changed. If the latest schema has changed then a `MetadataUpdateControlMessage` is injected to trigger the downstream constructs to update their schemas.\r\n* A `FlushControlMessage` is also injected since the currently open avro files need to be closed and new files opened to receive records with the new schema.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-251\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nHaving UpdateProviderFactory able to instantiate FileSystem with URI.\r\nUse case: We can pass specific file system URI to HiveSource where the only way we can use same file system uri on HdfsBasedUpdateProvider currently is to pass default filesystem uri into job property where this can break behavior of other instances that uses FileSystem.\r\nSame as what HiveSource did, UpdateProviderFactory will accept \"hive.unit.updateProvider.fs.uri\" to instantiate FileSystem where it not given it will fallback to previous logic.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nPerformed integration test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] This PR adds support for converting JSON records from JSON sources into Parquet format. The user has to define the source.schema which will help in generating Parquet schema and conversion of JSON into Parquet. In future, a ParquetHdfsWriter could be implemented to write Parquet files.\r\nThe following data types are supported for now:\r\nSTRING\r\nINT\r\nLONG\r\nFLOAT\r\nDOUBLE\r\nBOOLEAN\r\nARRAY\r\nENUM\r\nRECORD\r\nMAP\r\nNesting is not supported for now.\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\norg.apache.gobblin.converter.parquet.JsonIntermediateToParquetConverterTest\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA]\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-238\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n#### Motivation\r\nThe current implementation of `EnvelopeSchemaConverter` has several flaws:\r\n- Assumes top level payload schema field\r\n- Output record is the schema'ed payload but output schema is a String\r\n\r\nTo address the issues and improve envelope schema conversion, the task implements two types of `EnvelopeSchemaConverter`: `EnvelopePayloadExtractor` and `EnvelopePayloadDeserializer`.\r\n\r\n#### `EnvelopePayloadExtractor`\r\nThe previous `EnvelopeSchemaConverter` deprecated. Given an envelope record, the output schema will be the latest payload schema fetched from a kafka registry. The output record will be the deserialized payload with the latest schema\r\n\r\n#### `EnvelopePayloadDeserializer`\r\nGiven an envelope record, the output schema will set the payload field to have the latest schema fetched from a kafka registry and set the other fields as they are from the input schema. The output record will set the payload to be the deserialized object with the latest schema and set the other fields as they are from the input record\r\n\r\n#### Configurations\r\nOne configuration is required to set for any of the converters to work. It has no default value. \r\n```\r\n// The topic to fetch the latest schema of the payload from a kafka registry\r\nconverter.envelopeSchemaConverter.payloadSchemaTopic=\r\n```\r\nThe converter supports nested schema id\r\n```\r\nconverter.envelopeSchemaConverter.schemaIdField=\"metadata.payloadSchemaId\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests \r\n  1. `EnvelopePayloadExtractorTest`\r\n  2. `EnvelopePayloadDeserializerTest`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

We need a separate task to make `JobScheduler` unit testable.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-245\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrent KafkaSource ignores topic specific configurations on creating Extract of a WorkUnit. The task is to create the extract with topic specific configurations if any or else job level configurations.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nCurrently, there is no unit test for `KafkaSource`. It's testability is pretty bad. We need a task to make it testable.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not
