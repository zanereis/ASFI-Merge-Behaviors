Generating hundreds or thousands of file write buffers in a single bundle was causing workers to crash with out of memory. We now detect when too many files have been written in a bundle, and spill the remaining records to another PCollection. This PCollection is then grouped by destination before we write the remaining data to files. We shard destination keys 10 ways to prevent hotspotting. Tests of up to 10TB of data (going from 20 output tables up to 4000) were run, and a sharding factor of 10 seems to work quite well on all runs (and is noticeably faster than not sharding).\r\n\r\nIn this PR we also guard against the maximum file size that BigQuery supports.\r\n\r\nR: @jkff

`ValueProvider` and `PipelineOptions` excitement. The goal: allow users to access the `tempLocation` that they specify but make it inaccessible to `PTransform.expand(..)` implementations.\r\n\r\nThe natural way to do this would be to clone and alter the pipeline options, something that runners also ought to be doing when they tweak them like `TestDataflowRunner` does. I am informed this is not possible or feasible in a short timeframe.\r\n\r\nSo this is a hack that might not actually work that lets `get()` succeed but makes `isAccessible()` false. Throwing it out there as a strawman as I don't see a way to do this correctly given today's constraints.\r\n\r\nOnce an approach is decided upon, I will propagate as needed, to e.g. `gcpTempLocation`.","created_at":"2017-05-02T22:31:56Z","updated_at":"2017-05-26T05:18:08Z","closed_at":"2017-05-03T03:38:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"123b44c286f7f9cb361f1930dbb0501abd1805e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/2847/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/2847/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2847/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/b970b22491e9b3d1c184fe47e73518df3bd66a24","head":{"label":"kennknowles:runtime-ValueProvider","ref":"runtime-ValueProvider","sha":"b970b22491e9b3d1c184fe47e73518df3bd66a24","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror
