href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/57\">#57</a> - Added Archiver implementation (<code>JarToolModularJarArchiver</code>) that creates modular JAR files using the JDK jar tool. The implementation uses <code>java.util.spi.ToolProvider</code> introduced in Java 9, so if it is run on Java 7 or 8 the resulting archive will be identical to a one created by <code>JarArchiver</code> - the module descriptor is not going to be validated and no additional information (such as version, main class and packages) is going to be added.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/67\">#67</a> - Added ability to set the module version and main class of a modular JAR file</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/83\">#83</a> - Added new protected method (<code>postCreateArchive</code>) to <code>AbstractArchiver</code> that is called after the archive is created successfully</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/87\">#87</a> - of Levan Giguashvili (<a href=\"https://github.com/odinn1984\"><code>@‚Äãodinn1984</code></a>)  Snyk eng team to fix a possible security issue.

Now Plexus Archiver uses pure Java implementations to deal with file attributes so the <code>useJvmChmod</code> is no longer used and it is just ignored. <code>Archiver#setUseJvmChmod</code>, <code>Archiver#isUseJvmChmod()</code>, <code>UnArchiver#setUseJvmChmod</code>, <code>UnArchiver#isUseJvmChmod()</code>, <code>ArchiveEntryUtils#chmod( File, int, Logger, boolean )</code> and <code>ArchiveEntryUtils#chmod( File, int, Logger )</code> are deprecated and are subject to removal in a future version.</p>\n<h2>:rocket: New features and improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/51\">#51</a> - More specific exception for cases when there are no files to archive.
