The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n* When we close the hdfs state store, we should only remove the entry from `loadedMaps` rather than doing the active data cleanup. JVM GC should be able to help us GC those objects.\r\n* we should wait for the maintenance thread to stop before unloading the providers. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere are two race conditions between state store snapshotting and state store unloading which could result in query failure and potential data corruption.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCase 1:\r\n1. the maintenance thread pool encounters some issues and call the [stopMaintenanceTask,](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d9d79a54a3cd487380039c88ebe9fa708e0dcf23/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/StateStore.scala#L774) this function further calls [threadPool.stop.](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/StateStore.scala#L587) However, this function doesn't wait for the stop operation to be completed and move to do the state store [unload and clear.](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d9d79a54a3cd487380039c88ebe9fa708e0dcf23/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/StateStore.scala#L775-L778)\r\n2. the provider unload will [close the state store](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/StateStore.scala#L719-L721) which [clear the values of loadedMaps](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider.scala#L353-L355) for HDFS backed state store.\r\n3. if the not-yet-stop maintenance thread is still running and trying to do the snapshot, but the data in the underlying `HDFSBackedStateStoreMap` has been removed. if this snapshot process completes successfully, then we will write corrupted data and the following batches will consume this corrupted data.\r\n\r\nCase 2:\r\n\r\n1. In executor_1, the maintenance thread is going to do the snapshot for state_store_1, it retrieves the `HDFSBackedStateStoreMap` object from the loadedMaps, after this, the maintenance thread [releases the lock of the loadedMaps](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c6696cdcd611a682ebf5b7a183e2970ecea3b58c/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider.scala#L750-L751).\r\n2. state_store_1 is loaded in another executor, e.g. executor_2.\r\n3. another state store, state_store_2, is loaded on executor_1 and [reportActiveStoreInstance](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/StateStore.scala#L854-L871) to driver.\r\n4. executor_1 does the [unload](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c6696cdcd611a682ebf5b7a183e2970ecea3b58c/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/StateStore.scala#L713) for those no longer active state store which clears the data entries in the `HDFSBackedStateStoreMap`\r\n5. the snapshotting thread is terminated and uploads the incomplete snapshot to cloud because the [iterator doesn't have next element](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c6696cdcd611a682ebf5b7a183e2970ecea3b58c/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider.scala#L634) after doing the clear.\r\n6. future batches are consuming the corrupted data.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPreviously, the XML parser can't skip nested structure data fields effectively when they were not selected in the schema. For instance, in the below example, `df.select(\"struct2\").collect()` returns `Seq(null)` as `struct1` wasn't effectively skipped. This PR fixes this issue.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ROW>\r\n  <struct1>\r\n    <innerStruct><field1>1</field1></innerStruct>\r\n  </struct1>\r\n  <struct2>\r\n    <field2>2</field2>\r\n  </struct2>\r\n</ROW>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe also added more tests regarding projection in this PR.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to limit GHA job execution time to up to 3 hours in `build_and_test.yml` in order to avoid idle hung time.\r\nNew limit is applied for all jobs except three jobs (`precondition`, `infra-image`, and `breaking-changes-buf`) which didn't get a hung situation before.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince SPARK-45010, Apache spark used 5 hours.\r\n- #42727\r\n\r\nThis is shorter than GitHub Action's the default value (6 hour) is used.\r\n\r\n- https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idtimeout-minutes\r\n  > The maximum number of minutes to let a job run before GitHub automatically cancels it. Default: 360\r\n\r\nThis PR reduces to `3 hour` to follow new ASF INFRA policy which has been applied since April 20, 2024.\r\n- https://infra.apache.org/github-actions-policy.html\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-05-02T21:05:17Z","updated_at":"2024-05-02T22:29:54Z","closed_at":"2024-05-02T22:10:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cc6f114e9b9e669875ec82b5b3be6ee5b022940f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46344/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46344/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46344/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/12d4fdc9d68990d76dfc215138f9ccd4c5972468","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-48097","ref":"SPARK-48097","sha":"12d4fdc9d68990d76dfc215138f9ccd4c5972468","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe are backporting the client side StreamingQueryListenr to branch-3.5. In case there is usage of server side listener and users want to preserve this behavior, add this config handler in server, also the client can retrieve the config from the server on what type of listener to use. Note that on 4.0 and upwards we only have client side listener implemented in python client. So this config should only be sent to clients with spark version 3.5.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe are backporting the client side StreamingQueryListenr to branch-3.5. In case there is usage of server side listener and users want to preserve this behavior, add this config handler in server. Note that on 4.0 and upwards we only have client side listener implemented in python client. So this config should only be sent to clients with spark version 3.5\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere are two issues with the current variant decimal handling:\r\n1. The precision and scale of the `BigDecimal` returned by `getDecimal` is not checked. Based on the variant spec, they must be within the corresponding limit for DECIMAL4/8/16. An out-of-range decimal can lead to failure in the downstream Spark operations.\r\n2. The current `schema_of_variant` implementation doesn't correctly handle the case where precision is smaller than scale. Spark's `DecimalType` requires `precision >= scale`.\r\n\r\nThe Python side requires a similar fix for 1. During the fix, I found that Python error reporting was not correctly implemented (it was never tested either) and I also fixed it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThey are bug fixes and are required to process decimals correctly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

pick of PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46333 , fixing test issue due to difference in expected error message parameter formatting across branches; original description follows below:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhile migrating the `NTile` expression's type check failures to the new error class framework, PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38457 removed a pair of not-unnecessary `return` statements and thus caused certain branches' values to be discarded rather than returned.\r\n\r\nAs a result, invalid usages like\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect ntile(99.9) OVER (order by id) from range(10)\r\n```\r\n\r\ntrigger internal errors like errors like\r\n\r\n```\r\n java.lang.ClassCastException: class org.apache.spark.sql.types.Decimal cannot be cast to class java.lang.Integer (org.apache.spark.sql.types.Decimal is in unnamed module of loader 'app'; java.lang.Integer is in module java.base of loader 'bootstrap')\r\n  at scala.runtime.BoxesRunTime.unboxToInt(BoxesRunTime.java:99)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.NTile.checkInputDataTypes(windowExpressions.scala:877)\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of clear error framework errors like\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.ExtendedAnalysisException: [DATATYPE_MISMATCH.UNEXPECTED_INPUT_TYPE] Cannot resolve \"ntile(99.9)\" due to data type mismatch: The first parameter requires the \"INT\" type, however \"99.9\" has the type \"DECIMAL(3,1)\". SQLSTATE: 42K09; line 1 pos 7;\r\n'Project [unresolvedalias(ntile(99.9) windowspecdefinition(id#0L ASC NULLS FIRST, specifiedwindowframe(RowFrame, unboundedpreceding$(), currentrow$())))]\r\n+- Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=None)\r\n\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.package$AnalysisErrorAt.dataTypeMismatch(package.scala:73)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.CheckAnalysis.$anonfun$checkAnalysis0$7(CheckAnalysis.scala:315)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove error messages.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it improves an error message.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test case to AnalysisErrorSuite.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

pick of PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46333 , fixing test issue due to difference in expected error message parameter formatting across branches; original description follows below:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhile migrating the `NTile` expression's type check failures to the new error class framework, PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38457 removed a pair of not-unnecessary `return` statements and thus caused certain branches' values to be discarded rather than returned.\r\n\r\nAs a result, invalid usages like\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect ntile(99.9) OVER (order by id) from range(10)\r\n```\r\n\r\ntrigger internal errors like errors like\r\n\r\n```\r\n java.lang.ClassCastException: class org.apache.spark.sql.types.Decimal cannot be cast to class java.lang.Integer (org.apache.spark.sql.types.Decimal is in unnamed module of loader 'app'; java.lang.Integer is in module java.base of loader 'bootstrap')\r\n  at scala.runtime.BoxesRunTime.unboxToInt(BoxesRunTime.java:99)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.NTile.checkInputDataTypes(windowExpressions.scala:877)\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of clear error framework errors like\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.ExtendedAnalysisException: [DATATYPE_MISMATCH.UNEXPECTED_INPUT_TYPE] Cannot resolve \"ntile(99.9)\" due to data type mismatch: The first parameter requires the \"INT\" type, however \"99.9\" has the type \"DECIMAL(3,1)\". SQLSTATE: 42K09; line 1 pos 7;\r\n'Project [unresolvedalias(ntile(99.9) windowspecdefinition(id#0L ASC NULLS FIRST, specifiedwindowframe(RowFrame, unboundedpreceding$(), currentrow$())))]\r\n+- Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=None)\r\n\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.package$AnalysisErrorAt.dataTypeMismatch(package.scala:73)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.CheckAnalysis.$anonfun$checkAnalysis0$7(CheckAnalysis.scala:315)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove error messages.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it improves an error message.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test case to AnalysisErrorSuite.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to skip the tests that fail with 3.5 client and 4.0 server in Spark Connect (by adding `SPARK_SKIP_CONNECT_COMPAT_TESTS`). This is a base work for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46298. This partially backports https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45870\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds `SPARK_CONNECT_TESTING_REMOTE` environment variable so developers can run PySpark unittests against a Spark Connect server.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order to set up the CI that tests 3.5 client and 4.0 server in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested it in my fork, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46298\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-05-02T10:41:54Z","updated_at":"2024-05-03T06:20:48Z","closed_at":"2024-05-03T06:20:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fe91b1206df02469f042ff80c00f701efdda6f01","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhile migrating the `NTile` expression's type check failures to the new error class framework, PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38457 removed a pair of not-unnecessary `return` statements and thus caused certain branches' values to be discarded rather than returned.\r\n\r\nAs a result, invalid usages like\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect ntile(99.9) OVER (order by id) from range(10)\r\n```\r\n\r\ntrigger internal errors like errors like\r\n\r\n```\r\n java.lang.ClassCastException: class org.apache.spark.sql.types.Decimal cannot be cast to class java.lang.Integer (org.apache.spark.sql.types.Decimal is in unnamed module of loader 'app'; java.lang.Integer is in module java.base of loader 'bootstrap')\r\n  at scala.runtime.BoxesRunTime.unboxToInt(BoxesRunTime.java:99)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.NTile.checkInputDataTypes(windowExpressions.scala:877)\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of clear error framework errors like\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.ExtendedAnalysisException: [DATATYPE_MISMATCH.UNEXPECTED_INPUT_TYPE] Cannot resolve \"ntile(99.9)\" due to data type mismatch: The first parameter requires the \"INT\" type, however \"99.9\" has the type \"DECIMAL(3,1)\".

this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it improves an error message.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test case to AnalysisErrorSuite.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-05-02T08:03:59Z","updated_at":"2024-05-02T16:40:33Z","closed_at":"2024-05-02T14:22:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2663f2dc5f2270a9af4d3335dbbf7c037bddb4e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46333/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46333/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46333/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9432981a1102ce5e45910060fd4690b837e53bef","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-48081","ref":"SPARK-48081","sha":"9432981a1102ce5e45910060fd4690b837e53bef","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to promote `*MainAppResource` and `NonJVMResource` to `DeveloperApi`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince `Apache Spark Kubernetes Operator` depends on these traits and classes, we had better maintain it as a developer API officially from `Apache Spark 4.0.0`.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark-kubernetes-operator/pull/10\r\n\r\nSince there are no changes after `3.0.0`, these are defined as `Stable`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n Currently, the following query will throw DIVIDE_BY_ZERO error instead of returning null\r\n ```\r\nSELECT try_divide(1, decimal(0)); \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is caused by the rule `DecimalPrecision`:\r\n```\r\ncase b @ BinaryOperator(left, right) if left.dataType != right.dataType =>\r\n  (left, right) match {\r\n ...\r\n    case (l: Literal, r) if r.dataType.isInstanceOf[DecimalType] &&\r\n        l.dataType.isInstanceOf[IntegralType] &&\r\n        literalPickMinimumPrecision =>\r\n      b.makeCopy(Array(Cast(l, DataTypeUtils.fromLiteral(l)), r)) \r\n```\r\nThe result of the above makeCopy will contain `ANSI` as the `evalMode`, instead of `TRY`.\r\nThis PR is to fix this bug by replacing the makeCopy method calls with withNewChildren\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix in try_* functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, it fixes a long-standing bug in the try_divide function. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `mypy` failure by propagating `lint-python`'s `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` to `mypy`'s parameter correctly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe assumed that `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` is used for `dev/lint-python` like the following. That's not always guaranteed. We need to use `mypy`'s parameter to make it sure.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ff401dde50343c9bbc1c49a0294272f2da7d01e2/.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml#L705\r\n\r\nThis patch is useful whose `python3` chooses one of multiple Python installation like our CI environment.\r\n```\r\n$ docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/apache/apache-spark-ci-image:master-8905641334 bash\r\nWARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested\r\nroot@2ef6ce08d2c4:/# python3 --version\r\nPython 3.10.12\r\nroot@2ef6ce08d2c4:/# python3.9 --version\r\nPython 3.9.19\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example, the following shows that `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` is not considered by `mypy`.\r\n```\r\nroot@18c8eae5791e:/spark# PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=python3.9 mypy --python-executable=python3.11 --namespace-packages --config-file python/mypy.ini python/pyspark | wc -l\r\n3428\r\nroot@18c8eae5791e:/spark# PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=python3.9 mypy --namespace-packages --config-file python/mypy.ini python/pyspark | wc -l\r\n1\r\nroot@18c8eae5791e:/spark# PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=python3.11 mypy --namespace-packages --config-file python/mypy.ini python/pyspark | wc -l\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChanges the literal `sql` representation of a variant value to `parse_json(variant.toJson)`. This is because there is no other representation of a literal variant.\r\n\r\nThis allows variant default columns to work because default columns store a literal string representation in the schema struct fields metadata as the default value.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\npreviously we could not set a variant default column like \r\n```\r\ncreate table t(\r\n        v6 variant default parse_json('{\\\"k\\\": \\\"v\\\"}')\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadded UT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded a check in the `is_variant_null` expression where the length of the value field is verified to be greater than zero. If the length is zero, a `MALFORMED_VARIANT` exception is thrown.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nEarlier, `is_variant_null` was simply checking if the first byte of a variant value was zero. However, if the value field is empty, the first byte logically doesn't exist and therefore, it could result in undefined behavior. Such a case should ideally never be seen but it could appear in the case of data corruption.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdditional unit test to check if the zero-length variant throws an exception.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to **enable `spark.stage.ignoreDecommissionFetchFailure` by default** while keeping `spark.scheduler.maxRetainedRemovedDecommissionExecutors=0` without any change for Apache Spark 4.0.0 in order to help a user use this feature more easily by setting only one configuration, `spark.scheduler.maxRetainedRemovedDecommissionExecutors`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis feature was added at Apache Spark 3.4.0 via SPARK-40481 and SPARK-40979 and has been used for two years to support executor decommissioning features in the production.\r\n- #37924\r\n- #38441\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo because `spark.scheduler.maxRetainedRemovedDecommissionExecutors` is still `0`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-04-30T20:18:40Z","updated_at":"2024-12-08T21:10:42Z","closed_at":"2024-04-30T22:19:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"259f8dec9e334d0a6a4cf2818490190c19f1a53b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46308/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46308/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46308/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/221588952bfe61819418c61be170717d66af0eb5","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-48063","ref":"SPARK-48063","sha":"221588952bfe61819418c61be170717d66af0eb5","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- This PR fixes a correctness bug in commutative operator canonicalization where we currently do not take into account the evaluation mode during operand reordering. \r\n- As a result, the following condition will be incorrectly true:\r\n```\r\nval l1 = Literal(1)\r\nval l2 = Literal(2)\r\nval l3 = Literal(3)\r\nval expr1 = Add(Add(l1, l2), l3)\r\nval expr2 = Add(Add(l2, l1, EvalMode.TRY), l3)\r\nexpr1.semanticEquals(expr2) \r\n```\r\n- To fix the issue, we now reorder commutative operands only if all operators have the same evaluation mode.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- To fix a correctness bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added unit tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to parameterize `MAX_ARR_SIZE`, `MAX_MAP_SIZE`, and `MAX_STR_LEN` of `spark.sql.test.randomDataGenerator` by supporting.\r\n- `spark.sql.test.randomDataGenerator.maxArraySize`\r\n- `spark.sql.test.randomDataGenerator.maxMapSize`\r\n- `spark.sql.test.randomDataGenerator.maxStrLen`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nApache Spark already has the code which needs these parameters. We had better support these to allow the developers to use them without changing and recompiling the source code.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0329479acb6758c4d3e53d514ea832a181d31065/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/streaming/StreamingQueryHashPartitionVerifySuite.scala#L155-L156\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `StreamingQueryHashPartitionVerifySuite` to update golden files correctly.\r\n- The documentation is added.\r\n- Newly generated files are updated.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPreviously, `SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES` doesn't work as expected because it updates the files under `target` directory. We need to update `src/test` files.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```\r\n$ SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *StreamingQueryHashPartitionVerifySuite\"\r\n\r\n$ git status\r\nOn branch master\r\nYour branch is up to date with 'apache/master'.\r\n\r\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```\r\n$ SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *StreamingQueryHashPartitionVerifySuite\" \\\r\n-Dspark.sql.test.randomDataGenerator.maxStrLen=100 \\\r\n-Dspark.sql.test.randomDataGenerator.maxArraySize=4\r\n\r\n$ git status\r\nOn branch SPARK-48060\r\nYour branch is up to date with 'dongjoon/SPARK-48060'.\r\n\r\nChanges not staged for commit:\r\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\r\n  (use \"git restore <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\r\n\tmodified:   sql/core/src/test/resources/structured-streaming/partition-tests/randomSchemas\r\n\tmodified:   sql/core/src/test/resources/structured-streaming/partition-tests/rowsAndPartIds\r\n\r\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs. I regenerate the data like the following.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *StreamingQueryHashPartitionVerifySuite\" \\\r\n-Dspark.sql.test.randomDataGenerator.maxStrLen=100 \\\r\n-Dspark.sql.test.randomDataGenerator.maxArraySize=4\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-04-30T16:34:20Z","updated_at":"2024-04-30T19:52:04Z","closed_at":"2024-04-30T19:50:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8d19de40a6c91293618e86e3a4c7ed2ea6cd4e6b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a follow-up for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45930, where we introduced ShuffleCleanupMode and implemented cleaning up of shuffle

This change fixed the bug by changing to use `ShuffleDriverComponents.removeShuffle` instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is to address the comments in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to implement the structured log framework on the `java side`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, the structured log framework on the `scala side` is basically available, but the`Spark Core` code also includes some `Java code`, which also needs to be connected to the structured log framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, only for developers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Add some new UT.\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

It's probably because of illegal references like `df1.select(df2.col(\"a\"))`. SQLSTATE: 42704\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is due to existing plan caching in `ResolveRelations` doesn't work with Spark Connect\r\n\r\n```\r\n=== Applying Rule

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n Currently, the following query will throw DIVIDE_BY_ZERO error instead of returning null\r\n ```\r\nSELECT try_divide(1, decimal(0)); \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is caused by the rule `DecimalPrecision`:\r\n```\r\ncase b @ BinaryOperator(left, right) if left.dataType != right.dataType =>\r\n  (left, right) match {\r\n ...\r\n    case (l: Literal, r) if r.dataType.isInstanceOf[DecimalType] &&\r\n        l.dataType.isInstanceOf[IntegralType] &&\r\n        literalPickMinimumPrecision =>\r\n      b.makeCopy(Array(Cast(l, DataTypeUtils.fromLiteral(l)), r)) \r\n```\r\nThe result of the above makeCopy will contain `ANSI` as the `evalMode`, instead of `TRY`.\r\nThis PR is to fix this bug by replacing the makeCopy method calls with withNewChildren\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix in try_* functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, it fixes a long-standing bug in the try_divide function. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Changed the `tags` variable of the `TreeNode` class to initialize lazily. This will reduce unnecessary driver memory pressure.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Plans with large expression or operator trees are known to cause driver memory pressure; this is one step in alleviating that issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting UT covers behavior.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR creates a timestamp formatter with the timezone directly for formatting. Previously, we called `withZone` for every value in the `format` function. Because the original `zoneId` in the formatter is null and never equals the one we pass in, it creates new copies of the formatter over and over.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n...\r\n     *\r\n     * @param zone  the new override zone, null if no override\r\n     * @return a formatter based on this formatter with the requested override zone, not null\r\n     */\r\n    public DateTimeFormatter withZone(ZoneId zone) {\r\n        if (Objects.equals(this.zone, zone)) {\r\n            return this;\r\n        }\r\n        return new DateTimeFormatter(printerParser, locale, decimalStyle, resolverStyle, resolverFields, chrono, zone);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nimprovement\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n- Existing tests\r\n- I also ran the DateTimeBenchmark result locally, there's no performance gain at least for these cases.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChanging serialization and deserialization of collated strings so that the collation information is put in the metadata of the enclosing struct field - and then read back from there during parsing.\r\n\r\nFormat of serialization will look something like this:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"struct\",\r\n  \"fields\": [\r\n    \"name\": \"colName\",\r\n    \"type\": \"string\",\r\n    \"nullable\": true,\r\n    \"metadata\": {\r\n      \"__COLLATIONS\": {\r\n        \"colName\": \"UNICODE\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we have a map we will add suffixes `.key` and `.value` in the metadata:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"struct\",\r\n  \"fields\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"mapField\",\r\n      \"type\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"map\",\r\n        \"keyType\": \"string\",\r\n        \"valueType\": \"string\",\r\n        \"valueContainsNull\": true\r\n      },\r\n      \"nullable\": true,\r\n      \"metadata\": {\r\n        \"__COLLATIONS\": {\r\n          \"mapField.key\": \"UNICODE\",\r\n          \"mapField.value\": \"UNICODE\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt will be a similar story for arrays (we will add `.element` suffix). We could have multiple suffixes when working with deeply nested data types (Map[String, Array[Array[String]]] - see tests for this example)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPutting collation info in field metadata is the only way to not break old clients reading new tables with collations. `CharVarcharUtils` does a similar thing but this is much less hacky, and more friendly for all 3p clients - which is especially important since delta also uses spark for schema ser/de. \r\n\r\nIt will also remove the need for additional logic introduced in #46083 to remove collations before writing to HMS as this way the tables will be fully HMS compatible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nWith unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch makes spark connect supporting set scheduler pool name like vanilla spark.\r\n\r\nA new field `scheduler_pool` in `ExecutePlanRequest` rpc is added. User could call `SparkSession.setSchedulerPool` to set pool name and `SparkSession.clearSchedulerPool` to clear. Server will call SparkContext.setLocalProperty if field `scheduler_pool` is set.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark fair scheduler is better for multi-user settings, and spark connect could be deployed in multi-user environment, so it's natural for spark connect to support set fair scheduler pool name.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, two connect api is added: `SparkSession.setSchedulerPool`, `SparkSession.clearSchedulerPool`\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd a new Unit test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to fix SortShuffleWriter lacks shuffle write related metrics resulting in potentially inaccurate data.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen the shuffle writer is SortShuffleWriter, it does not use SQLShuffleWriteMetricsReporter to update metrics, which causes AQE to obtain runtime statistics and the rowCount obtained is 0.\r\n\r\nSome optimization rules rely on rowCount statistics, such as `EliminateLimits`. Because rowCount is 0, it removes the limit operator. At this time, we get data results without limit.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/59d5946cfd377e9203ccf572deb34f87fab7510c/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/exchange/ShuffleExchangeExec.scala#L168-L172\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/59d5946cfd377e9203ccf572deb34f87fab7510c/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/optimizer/Optimizer.scala#L2067-L2070\r\n\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to update `sql-ref-ansi-compliance.md` and `sql-ref-identifier.md`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Since SPARK-44444, `spark.sql.ansi.enabled` is `true`.\r\n  - 46013\r\n- Apache Spark uses `spark.sql.ansi.enforceReservedKeywords` to enforce `ANSI SQL reserved keywords` instead of `spark.sql.ansi.enabled`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is only a documentation fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, default columns that have a default of a `RuntimeReplaceable` expression fails.\r\n\r\nThis is because the `AlterTableCommand` constant folds before replacing expressions with the actual implementation. For example:\r\n```\r\nsql(s\"CREATE TABLE t(v VARIANT DEFAULT parse_json('1')) USING PARQUET\")\r\nsql(\"INSERT INTO t VALUES(DEFAULT)\")\r\n```\r\nfails because `parse_json` is `RuntimeReplaceable` and is evaluated before the analyzer inserts the correct expression into the plan\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we run the `ReplaceExpressions` rule before `ConstantFolding`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis allows default columns to use expressions that are `RuntimeReplaceable`\r\n\r\nThis is especially important for Variant types because literal variants are difficult to create - `parse_json` will likely be used the majority of the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nadded UT\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd the following syntax to CREATE VIEW... WITH SCHEMA ...:\r\n```\r\nCREATE [ OR REPLACE ] [ TEMPORARY ] VIEW [ IF NOT EXISTS ] view_name\r\n    [ column_list ]\r\n    [ schema_binding ] \r\n    [ COMMENT view_comment ]\r\n    [ TBLPROPERTIES clause ]\r\n    AS query\r\n\r\nschema_binding\r\n   WITH SCHEMA { BINDING | [TYPE] EVOLUTION | COMPENSATION }\r\n\r\ncolumn_list\r\n   ( { column_alias [ COMMENT column_comment ] } [, ...] )\r\n```\r\n\r\nAllow changing of the schema binding in:\r\n```\r\nALTER VIEW view_name  schema_binding\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe semantic is:\r\n\r\nSchema_binding\r\nOptionally specifies how the view adapts to changes to the schema of the query due to changes in the underlying object definitions.\r\nThis clause is not supported for temporary views.\r\n\r\n- BINDING\r\nThe view will become invalid if the query column-list changes except for the following conditions:\r\nThe column-list includes a star clause, and there are additional columns. These additional columns are ignored.\r\nThe type of one or more columns changed in a way that allows them to be safely cast to the types using implicit casting rules.\r\n\r\n- COMPENSATION\r\nThe view will become invalid if the query column list changes except for the following conditions:\r\nThe column-list includes a star clause, and there are additional columns. These additional columns are ignored.\r\nThe type of one or more columns changed in a way that allows them to be cast using explicit cast rules.\r\nThis is the default behavior.\r\n\r\n- TYPE EVOLUTION\r\nThe view will adopt any changes to types in the query column list into is own definition when such a change is detected upon reference of the view.\r\n\r\n- EVOLUTION\r\nBehaves like TYPE EVOLUTION and also adopts changes in column names or added and dropped columns if the view does not include an explicit column list.\r\nThe view will only be invalidated if the query cannot be parsed anymore, or the optional view column_list does not match the number of expressions in the query select-list anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also introduce a new SQL Config:\r\nspark.sql.defaultViewSchemaBinding\r\n Control the default behavior of views when the underlying schema changes.\r\n Valid values are: \r\n* COMPENSATION - Any supported casts.\r\n* DISABLED - Disable the feature.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSchema changes are a frequent occurrence, especially when ingesting data.\r\nIn the course of it most frequently:\r\n\r\n- Types may need to be widened\r\n- Columns are added to tables\r\n- Fields are added to structs\r\n\r\nThe traditional SCHEMA BINDING behavior makes schema evolution very hard since it invalidates views agressively.\r\nThis causes erros, requiring user intervention.\r\nAllowing views to be created to \"roll with the punches\" or tolerate changes in the underlying schema improves uptime.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, this is a new feature with new grammar and a new config to influence its default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew tests are added\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdditional null check to the `safeMapToJValue`. Normally we won't create a `StreamingQueryProgress` with map fields as null. It is also very unlikely in Spark Connect, but it is theoretically possible because we send the json directly in Spark Connect, so add this check for additional safety.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMinor bug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to update the packages name removed in building the spark docker image.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen our default image base was switched from `ubuntu 20.04` to `ubuntu 22.04`, the unused installation package in the base image has changed, in order to eliminate some warnings in building images and free disk space more accurately, we need to correct it.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\n#35 [29/31] RUN apt-get remove --purge -y     '^aspnet.*' '^dotnet-.*' '^llvm-.*' 'php.*' '^mongodb-.*'     snapd google-chrome-stable

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis fixes how `ColumnVector` handles copying arrays when the vector has a dictionary and null values. The possible issues with the previous implementation:\r\n- An `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` may be thrown when the `ColumnVector` has nulls and dictionaries. This is because the dictionary id for `null` entries might be invalid and should not be used for `null` entries.\r\n- Copying a `ColumnarArray` (which contains a `ColumnVector`) is incorrect, if it contains `null` entries. This is because copying a primitive array does not take into account the `null` entries, so all the null entries get lost.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed to avoid `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` and to produce correct results when copying `ColumnarArray`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe only user facing changes are to fix existing errors and incorrect results.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-04-27T01:42:14Z","updated_at":"2024-09-04T21:05:35Z","closed_at":"2024-04-28T03:07:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3478627714aebb54500dd1e290249d67246beef7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46254/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46254/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46254/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/58572bfed21d680a17e9f7ed018606becc204e32","head":{"label":"gene-db:dictionary-nulls","ref":"dictionary-nulls","sha":"58572bfed21d680a17e9f7ed018606becc204e32","user":{"login":"gene-db","id":77996944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTk2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77996944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db","html_url":"https://github.com/gene-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":654336314,"node_id":"R_kgDOJwBhOg","name":"spark","full_name":"gene-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gene-db","id":77996944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTk2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77996944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db","html_url":"https://github.com/gene-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gene-db/spark","description":"Apache
