is a work-in-progress to potentially simplify DML for beginners by removing the need when printing to cast single cells using as.scalar (`print(as.scalar(A[1,1])`) or matrices using toString (`print(toString(A)`). This would allow DML such as `print(A[1,1])` and `print(A)`.\r\n\r\nThis PR handles the following situations:\r\n```\r\nA = matrix(\"1 2 3 4 5 6\", rows=2, cols=3);\r\nprint(as.scalar(A[1,1]));\r\nprint(A[1,2]);\r\nprint(\"one two \" + A[1,3]);\r\nprint(A[2,1] + \" five six\");\r\nprint(\"four \" + A[2,2] + \" six\");\r\nprint(A[1,1] + \" two \" + A[1,3]);\r\nB = A[2,3];\r\nprint(B);\r\nprint(\"five \" + B);\r\nprint(B + \" seven\");\r\nprint(\"five \" + B + \" seven\");\r\nC=A[2,1];\r\nprint(C+' five '+B);\r\nprint(A);\r\nprint(\"$$$\" + A);\r\nprint(A + \"!!!\");\r\nprint(\"@@@\" + A + \"%%%\");\r\nD=matrix(\"1 2 3 4\", rows=2, cols=2);\r\nprint(D + \"***\" + A);\r\nprint(A[1:2,2:3]);\r\nprint(\"^^^\" + A[1:2,2:3]);\r\nprint(A[1:2,2:3] + \"###\");\r\nprint(\"[[[\" + A[1:1,1:3] + \"]]]\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR does not handle all potential situations, such as `print(A+B)` where A and B are matrices.

is the code for the initial Scala DSL implementation. Since it's huge, I split it up into logical commits that could potentially reviewed by different people. The changes to the `pom.xml` file include the maven snapshot repository for the Emma dependency and the Scala-reflect library.\r\n\r\nIn the MLContext API I replaced the `Matrix.java` with the `Matrix.scala`. I have not added all the transformations since I would like to discuss which transformations should really be exposed.\r\n\r\nAs for the DSL implementation I split it into two parts:\r\n\r\n1) API - the user API for working with Matrices and built-in functions. \r\n2) Compiler - the compiler infrastructure to convert Scala ASTs to DML\r\n\r\nBoth include a set of tests but could probably be extended. The DSL still has some limitations which should be sufficiently described in the documentation that I added. \r\n\r\nI think before declaring it a non-experimental feature there should be some serious testing with actual usecases. This might be interesting for @dusenberrymw, @iyounus and others.","created_at":"2017-02-28T01:49:18Z","updated_at":"2021-11-01T12:53:09Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/409/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/409/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/409/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/e55505e287997dd2a536d022d619ff5a9609f7f7","head":{"label":"fschueler:SYSTEMML-1353","ref":"SYSTEMML-1353","sha":"e55505e287997dd2a536d022d619ff5a9609f7f7","user":{"login":"fschueler","id":4837217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzcyMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4837217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler","html_url":"https://github.com/fschueler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49135448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTEzNTQ0OA==","name":"systemml","full_name":"fschueler/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fschueler","id":4837217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzcyMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4837217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler","html_url":"https://github.com/fschueler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fschueler/systemml","description":"Mirror

@bertholdreinwald @dusenberrymw  To avoid wasting time, I have created this PR to allow committers to raise their concerns about the integration of this approach before we spend a week or two in this direction, rather than when the work is complete. \r\n\r\nThe high-level proposal is to extend our for loop to iterate over the rows of matrix as follows:\r\n```python\r\nfor( [Xb, yb] in [X, y], batch_size=64) {\r\n  ....\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis construct allows us to perform low-level optimization such as prefetching of blocks without requiring the user to do so via explicit udf `next_batch(X, batch_size=64)`. \r\n\r\nTo support this construct without overhauling the engine, we support at max two iterator variables. This allows us to use our existing [IterablePredicate](https://github.com/niketanpansare/incubator-systemml/blob/d94c8799b13682c53bdacdbb876559c4c251332d/src/main/java/org/apache/sysml/parser/IterablePredicate.java) construct. In addition, we have extended [ForProgramBlock](https://github.com/niketanpansare/incubator-systemml/blob/d94c8799b13682c53bdacdbb876559c4c251332d/src/main/java/org/apache/sysml/runtime/controlprogram/ForProgramBlock.java#L132) to support iterating over MatrixObject rather than IntObject.\r\n\r\nThe alternative to this approach are as follows:\r\n1. The user specifies the prefetch budget (let's say 1G or 10%) and we reserve that for SP/CP `next_batch(X, batch_size=64)`.\r\n2. Refactor breast cancer script to fetch batches in two step: First we extract a big_mini_batch which will likely be a SP Indexing instruction that generates a MatrixBlock which can fit in CP. Then, in a for loop, we perform CP indexing on it.\r\n\r\nI will hold off on making progress in this PR until we all agree on this approach.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE DONOT MERGE THIS PR

executing the script `dev/release-build.sh --release-prepare ...` the _Maven Release Plugin_ repeatedly prompts for the passphrase to unlock the GPG signing key despite the exported `GPG_PASSPHRASE` environment variable.\r\n\r\n**Reason**\r\n\r\nThe _[Maven GPG Plugin](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-gpg-plugin/index.html)_ accepts a `gpg.passphrase` argument like this:\r\n\r\n```Bash\r\nmvn gpg:sign -Dgpg.passphrase=\"$GPG_PASSPHRASE\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever when used in combination with the _[Maven Release Plugin](http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/prepare-mojo.html)_ then the GPG passphrase needs to be passed with the `-Darguments` parameter:\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nmvn release:prepare -Darguments=\"-Dgpg.passphrase=\\\"$GPG_PASSPHRASE\\\"\"\r\n                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\nSee http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-gpg-plugin/usage.html\r\n\r\n**Proposed Changes**\r\n\r\n- use the `-Darguments` property to pass on the `gpg.passphrase` and the `skipTest` flag\r\n- if the `GPG_PASSPHRASE` environment variable was not exported, prompt for it (once)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ unset GPG_PASSPHRASE\r\n$ dev/release-build.sh --release-prepare --releaseVersion=\"2.0.2\"  --releaseRc=\"rc3\" ...\r\n\r\nThe environment variable GPG_PASSPHRASE is not set.

is the initial commit of the SystemML breast cancer project!\r\n\r\nPlease reference the attached `README.md` for an overview, background information, goals, our approach, etc.\r\n\r\nAt a high level, this PR introduces the following new files/folders:\r\n* `README.md`: Project information, etc.\r\n* `Preprocessing.ipynb`: PySpark notebook for preprocessing our histopathology slides into an appropriate `DataFrame` for consumption by SystemML.\r\n* `MachineLearning.ipynb`: PySpark/SystemML notebook for our machine learning approach thus far.  We started simple, and are currently in need of engine improvements in order to proceed forward.\r\n* `softmax_clf.dml`: Basic softmax model (multiclass logistic regression with normalized probabilities) as a sanity check.\r\n* `convnet.dml`: Our current deep convnet model.  We are starting simple with a slightly extended \"LeNet\"-like network architecture.  The goal will be to improve engine performance so that this model can be efficiently trained, and then move on to larger, more recent types of model architectures.\r\n* `hyperparam_tuning.dml`: A separate script for performing a hyperparameter search for our current convnet model.  This has been extracted from the notebook as the current `parfor` engine implementation is not yet sufficient for this type of necessary job.\r\n* `data`: A placeholder folder into which the data could be downloaded.\r\n* `nn`: A softlink that will point to the SystemML-NN library.\r\n* `approach.svg`: Image of our overall pipeline used in `README.md`.\r\n\r\nOverall, I want this project to serve as a large-scale, end-to-end machine learning project that can drive necessary core improvements for SystemML.","created_at":"2017-01-17T22:28:57Z","updated_at":"2017-01-20T20:20:10Z","closed_at":"2017-01-20T20:20:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5369dba3379d65eaee9453494fe91b7e4b5ab1ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/347/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/347/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/347/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/76d85f9a9ab7545eb1381c6dddef77fbf436bdfe","head":{"label":"dusenberrymw:breast_cancer","ref":"breast_cancer","sha":"76d85f9a9ab7545eb1381c6dddef77fbf436bdfe","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":46521692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NjUyMTY5Mg==","name":"systemml","full_name":"dusenberrymw/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw/systemml","description":"Mirror

on the discussion with @frreiss and @bertholdreinwald , I am proposing to switch our default BLAS from Java-based BLAS to native BLAS. We will recommend using Intel MKL and provide optional support other BLAS such as OpenBLAS (and possibly Accelerate) etc. Also, if no BLAS is installed, we will switch to Java-based BLAS. This future-proofs SystemML from hardware improvement made in other BLAS and also simplifies testing. \r\n\r\nThe proposed solution in this jar will work:\r\n\r\n1. In distributed setting with no additional dependency other than BLAS.\r\n2. On hybrid cluster with different types of BLAS.\r\n3. With Parfor.\r\n4. Without an additional artifact: systemml-accelerator.jar (like https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/pull/307).\r\n\r\nSince we are not including external dependency (such as BLAS), this PR adds no additional overhead on the release process. Also when we add support to TSMM, [SYSTEMML-1166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SYSTEMML-1166) will be resolved and will again future proof SystemML on related issues.\r\n\r\nThe initial performance numbers are same as that of https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/pull/307\r\n\r\n@mboehm7  @dusenberrymw  @nakul02 @lresende @deroneriksson @asurve  @fschueler
