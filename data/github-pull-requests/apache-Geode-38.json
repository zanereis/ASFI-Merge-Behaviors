MethodInvocationAuthorizer should be unique per query and should\r\nnot be changed for a particular query while it's being executed so,\r\nstarting with this commit, it is directly stored as part of the\r\nExecutionContext. This also prevents the creation of multiple instances\r\nof the DefaultQueryService and the configured authorizer itself while\r\nthe intermediate result objects are being traversed during the query\r\nevaluation.\r\n\r\n- Added tests.\r\n- Fixed minor warnings.\r\n- Replaced usages of 'junit.Assert' by 'assertj'.\r\n- The AttributeDescriptor and MethodDispatch classes do not require\r\n  MethodInvocationAuthorizer as a constructor parameter anymore, the\r\n  authorizer is obtained from the context, and **only** when needed.\r\n- The MethodDispatch class does not internally store and cache the\r\n  MethodInvocationAuthorizer instance anymore, thus allowing Geode to\r\n  change the authorizer in runtime without needing to re-load every\r\n  already known method (expensive due to reflection).\r\n- The ExecutionContext uses a no-op authorizer when created from a\r\n  client cache: authorization and authentication logic happens only on\r\n  server side, and the authorizer will be obtained from the cluster\r\n  configuration service directly instead of the query service when OQL\r\n  security is fully implemented.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

MethodInvocationAuthorizer should be unique per query and should\r\nnot be changed for a particular query while it's being executed so,\r\nstarting with this commit, it is directly stored as part of

GEODE-7026 on Windows as well\r\n\r\nThis should reduce failures caused by GEODE-6183 and GEODE-7026. It should also increase the available information for debugging by including statusFailedWithException details for Errors (so we'll see info about the Process when the ConditionTimeoutException

new option, --stage-configuration, to the create disk-store command\r\nprovides the capability to define a disk-store in the cluster configuration\r\nprior to any server members have joined the cluster. Using this option\r\nwill only update the cluster-configuration, disk-stores will not be\r\ncreated on any current server members.\r\n\r\nServers joining the cluster (or restarting) will then inherit the new\r\ndisk-store configuration and create the appropriate directory and\r\ndisk-store files.\r\n\r\nThis is useful for persisting the PDX types to a disk-store other than\r\nDEFAULT. When starting a cluster, the disk-store for pdx can be added to\r\nthe configuration after the locators are started and before any servers\r\nare started. Next, PDX persistence is then configured to use the disk-store,\r\nand finally the servers are started.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Ken Howe <khowe@pivotal.io>\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

use of log4j-core from geode-core unit tests. After this PR merges in, we should be able to remove geode-log4j dependency from geode-junit.\r\n\r\nGfshInitFileTest and ShowMissingDiskStoresFunctionTest had significant issues as tests so both of these have been pretty much rewritten.\r\n\r\nIn all tests I did the following:\r\na) Extracted any tests that more appropriately belonged in a different unit test.\r\nb) Replace use of Fakes with just the minimum needed Mockito mocks.\r\nc) Use AssertJ catchThrowable for any testing of expected exceptions.\r\nd) Replace JUnit Assert with AssertJ which is 1000% better.\r\ne) Use MockitoRule with STRICT_STUBS to keep the mocking precise.\r\n\r\n1) [Remove log4j-core from
