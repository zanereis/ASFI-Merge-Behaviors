This was renamed to\r\n\"partial_filter_selector\" in b98de40 but the fallback\r\ncode did not correctly handle the case where\r\na \"selector\" existed alongside a \"partial_filter_selector\".\r\n\r\nThis situation can occur when a the _index endpoint is\r\nused to create a text index with a \"selector\". The resulting\r\ndesign document contains an empty \"partial_filter_selector\"\r\nfield *and* the \"selector\" field that was passed in. The\r\nprevious implementation of the fallback would detect the\r\npresence of \"partial_filter_selector\" and use the empty\r\nvalue (match all docs) instead of faling back to the\r\n\"selector\" field.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes the behaviour so that a \"selector\"\r\nwill be used even if an empty \"partial_filter_selector\"\r\nis present. A secondary fix would be to change the index\r\ncreation so that we never use \"selector\" in the underlying\r\nindex design document, even if it is passed to the _index\r\nAPI.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRun the test suite (with text indexes enabled). Attempt to create text indexes using the _index endpoint, specifying a \"selector\" field. Test that the partial index contains only the documents that match the selector.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n#818 \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works

Overview\r\n\r\nThe existing `couchdb` start script hard-codes the arguments to\r\n`-args_file` and `-config`. Although it is possible to copy this\r\nscript and modify it, or modify it in place, that is less than ideal\r\nand can lead to all kinds of difficulties.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the following environment variables:\r\n\r\n- `ARGS_FILE`: By default, set to the existing hard-coded value.\r\n- `SYSCONFIG_FILE`: By default, set to the existing hard-coded value.\r\n- `COUCHDB_ARGS_FILE`: If non-empty, overrides `$ARGS_FILE`.\r\n- `COUCHDB_SYSCONFIG_FILE`: If non-empty, overrides `$SYSCONFIG_FILE`.\r\n\r\nBy changing the script to use these environment variables, it makes it easily possible\r\nto use different settings without tinkering with the pristine installed CouchDB environment.\r\n\r\nKindly consider this feature request as a useful, and \"mostly harmless\" addition to CouchDB.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThis pull request is designed to be completely backward-compatible with the existing `couchdb` script.\r\n\r\nTesting can be very simple:\r\n\r\n1. Run without any environment changes - should do precisely what the existing start script does.\r\n2. Run as `COUCHDB_ARGS_FILE=/some/different/vm.args couchdb` - should use the args from the specified `vm.args`.\r\n3. Run as `COUCHDB_SYSCONFIG_FILE=/some/different/sys.config couchdb` - should use the configuration in the specified `sys.config`.\r\n4. Run with both overrides - should be a combination of the above two tests.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nPR apache/couchdb-documentation#227\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is

Overview\r\n\r\nWe are using `unique_monotonic_integer` to name the test databases in unit testing. That means that on erlang R > 18 we are always creating databases with the same names.\r\n\r\nWhen a unit tests crashing or suites don't cleaning up on teardown, they are leaving behind\r\nold database files, so on a next run, in dev environment, tests' setup fails with `database exists` exception.\r\n\r\nThis fix cleans up old database files prior running the unit tests, making sure we are always running the test from the same blank state.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n- Run test suite, e.g. `make check apps=couch`.\r\n- Confirm that there are temporary test databases in `$PWD/tmp/data` and `/$PWD/tmp/tmp_data` left behind.\r\n- Run `rebar setup_eunit`. It's going to fail with \"One or more files already exist on disk and were not generated\", but it'll clean up `tmp` dir nevertheless, so check out same `$PWD/tmp/data` and `/$PWD/tmp/tmp_data` to confirm them to be empty.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n\r\n

Overview\r\n\r\n01252f97 introduced a \"catch-all\" feature to Mango that allowed\r\nqueries to fall back on a full database scan (_all_docs) when\r\nno valid index was available.\r\n\r\nThis worked by creating a special index range representing\r\nthe full database scan.\r\n\r\nFor example, a selector:\r\n\r\n`{ \"_id\": \"foo\" }`\r\n\r\nwould be translated into a field range of:\r\n\r\n`[{ \"startkey\": \"foo\", \"endkey\": \"foo\"}]`\r\n\r\nthen prepending the catch-all field range, we would have:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n{ \"startkey\": null, \"endkey\": max_json_value},\r\n{ \"startkey\": \"foo\", \"endkey\": \"foo\"}\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis set gets passed into\r\nmango_cursor_view:choose_best_index to determine most selective\r\nindex and field range combination to use. Unfortunately, in\r\nthe event that we have one possible index (all_docs) and multiple\r\nvalid ranges, it just chooses the first range it finds -\r\nthe full index scan in this case.\r\n\r\nThis commit makes the catch-all field range the last\r\navailable option, ensuring we use the more selective\r\nrange where available.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRun queries against a large database with no indexes. Check execution_stats and _explain output to see that the startkey and endkey used are appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.  -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\nAt the moment, peruser-managed databases are prefixed with userdb- and that’s hardcoded.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows users to specify a different prefix, so we make this configurable.\r\n\r\nThe peruser config section looks:\r\n```\r\n[couch_peruser]\r\n; If enabled, couch_peruser ensures that a private per-user database\r\n; exists for each document in _users. These databases are writable only\r\n; by the corresponding user. Databases are in the following form:\r\n; userdb-{hex encoded username}\r\nenable = false\r\n; If set to true and a user is deleted, the respective database gets\r\n; deleted as well.\r\ndelete_dbs = false\r\n; prefix for user databases. If you change this after user dbs have been\r\n; created, the existing databases won’t get deleted if the associated user\r\n; gets deleted because of the then prefix mismatch.\r\ndatabase_prefix = userdb-\r\n```\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n```\r\nmake check

Overview\r\n\r\nThe compaction daemon was checking for custom configurations using\r\nshard names directly, which meant that users who defined a config for\r\na specific DB would not see it take effect.\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces support for custom configurations for both\r\ndatabases *and* shards. An example of a shard config would be\r\n\r\nshards/00000000-1fffffff/foo.1512750761 = [{db_fragmentation, \"70%\"}]\r\n\r\nWe don't anticipate that to be a typical usage pattern.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nCreate a clustered database ```foo``` and then configure a custom compaction rule for it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[compactions]\r\nfoo = [{db_fragmentation, 10%}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should add a test for this.

/{db}/_local_docs endpoints.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice?

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.

Now, in a peruser system, we recommend lower q because of all the file-descriptor overhead with larger q when peruser dbs are traditionally small-ish.\r\n\r\nThis PR is aimed to introduce new item in `couch_peruser` config section to specify the q value when creating peruser database. The default value is 1 instead of default value in `cluster/q`.\r\n```\r\n[couch_peruser]\r\n; If enabled, couch_peruser ensures that a private per-user database\r\n; exists for each document in _users. These databases are writable only\r\n; by the corresponding user. Databases are in the following form:\r\n; userdb-{hex encoded username}\r\nenable = false\r\n; If set to true and a user is deleted, the respective database gets\r\n; deleted as well.\r\ndelete_dbs = false\r\n+; set a default q value for peruser-created databases that is different from\r\n+; cluster / q\r\n+; +q = 1\r\n```\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what

Overview\r\n\r\nFix for #1001\r\nDiscarded any document not available in couchdb but only in main index. It seems couch db main index is not getting properly updated after purging documents. Compactor fails with error 'not_found' when it ties to get the full document from the couchdb.\r\n\r\nThis fix is cherry-picked from the fix done on top of 1.6.1 in #1003\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nCompaction fails continuously when a document is actually purged but not cleaned up in main index. This issue is random. I tested couple of databases that had the issue and compaction is working fine after the fix.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by

Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\nIf you specify \"create_target\": true in a replicator doc, the replicator creates the target database, with the default q value.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, it is allowed to specify \"create_database_params\": {\"q\": \"1\"} to have the replicator to create the target database with specified value (currently, the example is q=1 and q can be other value). The example of replication document looks like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"source\": \"http://foo:bar@localhost:15984/db1\",\r\n  \"target\": \"http://foo:bar@localhost:15984/db22\",\r\n  \"create_target\": true,\r\n  \"continuous\": false,\r\n   \"create_target_params\": {\"q\": \"1\"}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne thing to be highlighted is about the value in `source` and `target` field in replication document.\r\n\r\nMost of case database in `url` format were specified in replication document. \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"source\": \"http://foo:bar@localhost:15984/db1\",\r\n  \"target\": \"http://foo:bar@localhost:15984/db2\",\r\n  \"create_target\": true,\r\n  \"continuous\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, I found that the format `\"source\": \"shards/00000000-1fffffff/db3.1511408454\"` was also supported in replication document. But the database should be one in shard instead of logical database name. It looks to me that it doesn't make sense to specify q value if the shard database was specified.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1017/files#diff-3a45ba156c61480ff98a83509af1b2cdR135\r\n\r\nSo right now, only database creation with url format approached was extended.\r\n\r\n##

Overview\r\n\r\nmango_selector:has_required_fields checks that a list of\r\nindexed fields is covered by a given selector.

clustering module is in charge of keeping track of when the cluster\r\nis stable or unstable. A cluster is said to be \"stable\" if there weren't any\r\nnew nodes added or removed for some period of time.\r\n\r\nReplicator document processor uses cluster state to determine what to do with\r\ndocument updates as they come in. If a document update comes during a time when\r\ncluster is unstable, the update is skipped. The idea is that when cluster\r\nbecomes stable again, all the documents will be rescanned anyway.\r\n\r\nIn order for document updates to not be dropped, there is an implicit\r\nconstraint when cluster becomes stable again (couch_replicator_notifier\r\ngen_event broadcasts `{cluster, stable}` event), any subsequent calls to\r\n`couch_replicator_clustering:is_stable()` would return `true`. If that's not\r\nthe case then this sequence of events is possible:\r\n\r\n1. mem3_cluster process calls the cluster_stable event\r\n\r\n2. couch_replicator_notifier broadcasts {cluster, stable} event\r\n\r\n3. couch_replicator_doc_processor start processing documents\r\n\r\n4. On first document update couch_replicator_clustering:is_stable() is false,\r\nbecause that gen_server wasn't notifier yet.\r\n\r\n5. Document update is dropped.\r\n\r\n6. There won't be any rescans until cluster membership is changed again.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, switch to setting stable state first via a gen_server call. This\r\nway after the `{cluster, stable}` has been called, is_stable() is guaranteed to\r\nreturn true.\r\n\r\nNote: This issue is mostly theoretical. It was noticed by examinig the code\r\nrelated to another bug. The chance of the clustering process going to sleep\r\nimmediately after gen_event broadcast, then not handling the cast long enough\r\nfor a document to be processed by doc processor is pretty low.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by

Overview\r\n\r\nSince #816, mango JSON index on compound fields can be selected only if the selector make sure that all the fields listed in the index are always present. This commit add a special case where all clauses of an `$or` can ensure that a field is present.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if I had an index:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[A, B]\r\n```\r\n\r\nis_usable would now return true for the selector:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"A\": \"foo\",\r\n  \"$or\": {\r\n    \"B\": \"bar\",\r\n    \"B\": \"baz\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRun the mango test suite.

Overview\r\nFix for #1001 \r\nDiscarded any document not available in couchdb but only in main index.  It seems couch db main index is not getting properly updated after purging documents. Compactor fails with error 'not_found' when it ties to get the full document from the couchdb.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\nCompaction fails continuously when a document is actually purged but not cleaned up in main index.  This issue is random.  I tested couple of databases that had the issue and compaction is working fine after the fix. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

Overview\r\n\r\nAdds a test to verify the behaviour of duplicate fields in a Mango selector.\r\n\r\nThe fix for CVE-2017-12635 (#936) resulted in CouchDB's JSON parser only recognising the last instance of duplicated fields in a JSON object. This represents a breaking change to Mango (_find)\r\nbecause, previuously, all instances would have been considered when evaluating a selector.\r\n\r\nThis test verifies that Mango now only considers the last instance of a field, silently ignoring\r\nthose that appear before it.\r\n\r\nTBD whether we can or should show an error when this occurs, since this leads to predicates\r\nsilently being ignored.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRun the Mango test suite.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n#936\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

the 2.1.1 release process there was a fault identified with the process. Even after checking out the `2.1.1` tag, a `make dist` command will build a tarball that has the git short hash in the directory name and the file name.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to DRY out the process by checking if we are on a tag that matches the regex `^[0-9]+\\.[0-9]\\.[0-9]+(-RC[0-9]+)?$`. If so, that's the version used for the directory/tarball naming. If not, and we're inside of a git checkout (`.git` directory exists), append the git short version. If neither of those applies, we're already in a dist tarball - we use the pure #.#.# version from version.mk instead.\r\n\r\nOne problem exists: if a checkout has multiple tags of the form (`2.1.1-RC2` and `2.1.1`), the `2.1.1` tag will be used. This is probably fine, as the only time we'll have duplicate tags on the same checkout is when an RC becomes a real release.\r\n\r\nPlease read carefully and test. Place a copy of the modified Makefile at /tmp/Makefile and try the following:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit checkout 2.1.1 && cp /tmp/Makefile Makefile && make dist\r\ngit checkout 2.1.1-RC1 && cp /tmp/Makefile Makefile && make dist\r\ngit checkout master && cp /tmp/Makefile Makefile && make dist\r\n```\r\n\r\nand validate the

afb7c8e ported the use of `couch_util:unique_monotonic_integer` for the EUnit test suite instead of `erlang:now`. Unfortunately, this resulted in filenames being generated with double-quotation marks in them (`\"`), which are invalid filename characters on Windows. This failed many test suites, including `couch_epi` and `couch_log`.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the fix is a single character in the `io_lib:format` string:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\n24> A = integer_to_list(erlang:unique_integer([monotonic, positive])).\r\n\"20\"\r\n25> N = node().\r\nnonode@nohost\r\n27> io_lib:format(\"~p-~s\", [N, A]).\r\n[\"nonode@nohost\",45,\"20\"]\r\n28>

Overview\r\n\r\nIf a user specifies a value for use_index that is not valid for the current query - i.e. it does not meet the coverage requirements of the selector or sort fields - attempt to fall back to a valid index (or database scan) rather than returning a 400 error to the client.\r\n\r\nWhen a fallback occurs, populate the \"warning\" field in the response (as we already do when a full database scan takes place) to feed back to the user that `use_index` was ignored.\r\n\r\nThis change is partially as mitigation for #816, which may lead to some previously valid indexes being deemed invalid, and also to make `use_index` less brittle for production applications in general. \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRun the test suite. Run some mango queries with and without `use_index`. Observe that a warning is returned in the JSON and in Fauxton.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

Overview\r\n\r\nOptimize document updates by reducing the number of times couch_key_tree:stem/2 is called along with improving the performance of couch_key_tree:stem/2.\r\n\r\nFor the first part this mostly just involves ensuring that we pass paths to couch_key_tree:merge/2 in a specific order and then stem after we're done merging (if required, in the prep_and_validate_replicated_updates a stem is not needed so is avoided entirely).\r\n\r\nFor the second part, the old stemming algorithm worked by completely disassembling the tree and then reassembling it one path at time by merging back into a tree accumulator. The new algorithm is a recursive descent into the tree tracking depth and distance from leaves while unwinding the stack. This allows us to convert the O(N^2) approach from merging all branches back into the tree into an O(N) approach since we only ever visit each node once.

a configurable delay before retrying a document fetch in replicator.\r\n\r\nmissing_doc exceptions usually happen when there is a continuous replication\r\nset up and the source is updated. The change might appear in the changes feed,\r\nbut when worker tries to fetch the document's revisions it talks to a\r\nnode where internal replication hasn't caught up and so it throws an exception.\r\n\r\nPreviously the delay was hard-coded at 0 (that is retrying was immediate). The\r\nreplication would still make progress, but after crashing, retrying and\r\ngenerating a lot of unnecessary log noise. Since updating a source while\r\ncontinuous replication is running is a common scenario, it's worth optimizing\r\nfor it and avoiding wasting resources and spamming logs.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-30T18:59:32Z","updated_at":"2017-10-31T19:45:36Z","closed_at":"2017-10-31T19:45:33Z","merged_at":"2017-10-31T19:45:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"40b9f85f0be775fe5508f12332130f2695262595","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/934/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/934/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/934/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/f950b64ebbf3bc8877dc23328f5bbad9fd05cc0f","head":{"label":"cloudant:configurable-wait-on-missing-doc","ref":"configurable-wait-on-missing-doc","sha":"f950b64ebbf3bc8877dc23328f5bbad9fd05cc0f","user":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39005786,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTAwNTc4Ng==","name":"couchdb","full_name":"cloudant/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant/couchdb","description":"Mirror

Overview\r\nMango tests fail due to flaky tests with index deletion. I cannot recreate locally.\r\n@davisp and @garrensmith\r\nmentioned that it could be due to the latest ddoc_cache changes and suggested\r\nchanging r=3 to see if that would help. However, we recently changed tests to use\r\nn=1 as default for all dbs created. I wonder if having w=3 and n=1 could be the reason.\r\nWe get a 202 back, but the index isn't deleted in time when we go to retrieve it. So changing\r\nw=3  to w=1 to see if that will help. If not, I may add a wait loop inside delete.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\nLet's see if it passes travis.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/918\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [X] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects

Overview\r\n\r\nPreviously, the tests hardcoded a target host of `http://127.0.0.1:15984` with username \"testuser\" and password \"testpass\". This PR allows the host url and authentication parameters to be configured using environment variables. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we default to n=1 when creating the test databases rather than assuming the target cluster will have a single node.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRun the test suite. Try using a different username / password (following the README) or CouchDB 2.1 host.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n

   Fix erlang time module compatibility\r\n\r\n    `now/0` is deprecated since Erlang 18.0, and a set of new time related\r\n    functions are available.\r\n\r\n    Usually `now/0` can be replaced with `os:timestamp/0`, however in some\r\n    instances it was used effectively to produce monotonically incrementing values\r\n    rather than timestamps. So added a new `couch_util:unique_monotonic_integer/0`.\r\n\r\n    Most functional changes are in couch_uuid module. There `now/0` was used both\r\n    as a timestamp and for uniqueness. To emulate previous behavior, a local\r\n    incrementing clock sequence is used. If `os:timestamp/0` does not advance since\r\n    last call then the local clock is advanced by 1 microsecond and that's used to\r\n    generate the next V1 UUIDs.
