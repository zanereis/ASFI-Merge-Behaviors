PR removes ZK test parameterizations from ducktape by: \r\n* Removing `zk` from `quorum.all_non_upgrade`\r\n* Removing `quorum.zk` from `@matrix` and `@parametrize` annotations\r\n* Changing usages of `quorum.all` to `quorum.all_kraft`\r\n* Deleting `message_format_change_test.py`\r\n\r\nThe default `metadata_quorum` value still needs to be changed to KRaft rather than ZK, but this will be done in

should only call once `maybeSendResponseCallback` for each marker during the WriteTxnMarkersRequest handling.\r\nConsider the following 2 cases:\r\n\r\nFirst\r\nWe have 2 markers to append, one for producer-0, one for producer-1\r\nWhen we first process producer-0, it appends a marker to the __consumer_offset.\r\nThe __consumer_offset append finishes very fast because the group coordinator is no longer the leader. So the coordinator directly returns NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER. In its callback, it calls the maybeComplete() for the first time, and because there is only one partition to append, it is able to go further to call maybeSendResponseCallback() and decrement numAppends.\r\nThen it calls the replica manager append for nothing, in the callback, it calls the maybeComplete() for the second time. This time, it also decrements numAppends.\r\n\r\nSecond\r\nWe have 2 markers to append, one for producer-0, one for producer-1\r\nWhen we first process producer-0, it appends a marker to the __consumer_offset and a data topic foo.\r\nThe 2 appends will be handled by group coordinator and replica manager asynchronously.\r\nIt can be a race that, both appends finishes together, then they can fill the `markerResults` at the same time, then call the  `maybeComplete`. Because the `partitionsWithCompatibleMessageFormat.size == markerResults.size` condition is satisfied, both `maybeComplete` calls can go through to decrement the `numAppends` and cause a premature response.\r\n\r\nNote: the problem only happens with KIP-848 coordinator enabled.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17877","created_at":"2024-10-28T17:07:37Z","updated_at":"2024-11-05T10:06:32Z","closed_at":"2024-11-05T10:06:32Z","merged_at":"2024-11-05T10:06:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"c91243a4b71fb7430b0987f0a2ddf37f3a922927","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

current implementation of `TestUtils#verifyTopicDeletion` contained an incorrect logic when verifying the hard-deletion of topic directories. \r\nSpecifically, the logic was erroneously applying startsWith and endsWith checks on an array of partition directory names rather than on each individual directory name. This caused the validation to pass even when the target directories were still present, which could lead to data consistency issues during topic deletion operations.\r\n\r\nIf `Array[String].startsWith()` receives a `String` as a parameter, it implicitly converts the `String` into an `Array[Char]` and then compares it against the array of strings. \r\n\r\nAs a result, the actual comparison was mistakenly happening between:\r\n- **`partitionDirectoryNames` values (example):**  \r\n  `Array(\".lock\", \"bootstrap.checkpoint\", \"recovery-point-offset-checkpoint\", \"recovery-point-offset-checkpoint.tmp\", \"__cluster_metadata-0\", \"topic-0.9e1caebe9f5d499c9694032104eebe95-delete\", \"log-start-offset-checkpoint\", \"cleaner-offset-checkpoint\", \"replication-offset-checkpoint\", \"meta.properties\")`\r\n\r\n- **`tp` converted to an `Array[Char]`:**  \r\n  `Array('t', 'o', 'p', 'i', 'c', '-', '0')`\r\n\r\nThis implicit conversion led to incorrect behavior where the logic was not checking the directory names as intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

This is because the expected result asserted in `shouldFetchKeyRangeAcrossStoresWithNullKeyFrom()` coincidentally matched the result obtained at [line 272](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/17540/files#diff-77f6b10146a50b25e538ab71c9ffe18fd981d717b666c94d7c811af690cea1eeR272).\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate what my change covers, I reverted the changes from [#17540](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/17540) and applied my fix.

is possible that due to a network partition or delays on the wire a read request with a higher `leaderEpoch` reaches the share coordinator before a write request with a lower one for the same share partition. In this case, we have chosen to honor the highest `leaderEpoch` request and reject any subsequent lower value requests irrespective of the RPC type. However, this means that we need to persist the `leaderEpoch` seen in the read requests.\r\n\r\nIn the `ShareCoordinatorShard.readState` method we are storing the `leaderEpoch` present in the request directly in the `leaderEpochMap` timeline hashmap, if it is the highest `leaderEpoch` seen so far for a specific share partition. This however is folly. \r\n\r\nThe coordinator runtime guarantees the consistency of the timeline data structures when updated via the `replay` method. The `replay` method is called by the runtime whenever it persists some records into the topic it is managing. This method is implemented in `ShareCoordinatorShard.replay`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to remedy the situation this PR adds code into the `ShareCoordinatorService.readState` method to issue a `runtime.scheduleWriteOperation` call if the incoming read state request holds a valid `leaderEpoch` value (not -1). We cannot ascertain if the `leaderEpoch` in the read request is the highest so far for the given share partition because it is not possible to lookup the timeline data structures in the `ShareCoordinatorService` class since they are housed in `ShareCoordinatorShard` and an offset is needed to do the lookup, which we won't have. Secondly, we cannot move code to write the record in the shard read state method as we need the runtime to execute that callback which is present in the `ShareCoordinatorService`.\r\n\r\nHence, the new code will issue a `scheduleWriteOperation` call if leaderEpoch is != -1 and the supplied callback method `ShareCoordinatorShard.writeLeaderEpoch` (also part of the PR) will generate a record if the `leaderEpoch` is highest, or no record if it is same as last seen, or error if the epoch is old. We required a separate method because we want to only look at `leaderEpoch` and simply ignore other data fields. Also, we want to perform the optimization of not generating records if the `leaderEpoch` is -1 or equal to highest seen so far.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, a sequential call to the `runtime.scheduleReadOperation` will be made in `ShareCoordinatorService.readState` which is same as before.\r\n\r\n**TLDR**: We will issue a phantom write call (not explicitly issued by a caller) in `ShareCoordinatorService.readState` if the read request contains a valid `leaderEpoch`. Based on the response to the write, a standard read call will be scheduled. This way we will be able to persist the `leaderEpoch` correctly in the topic and timeline data structures.","created_at":"2024-10-22T16:02:14Z","updated_at":"2024-12-07T09:02:03Z","closed_at":"2024-12-07T09:02:03Z","merged_at":"2024-12-07T09:02:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"42f74a1c3afd693a16c3980ee022e82872e4bfa2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dajac","id":157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac","html_url":"https://github.com/dajac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6979675393,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABoAVlAQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-932","name":"KIP-932","color":"DA462F","default":false,"description":"Queues

have discovered two strange if statements, so I have committed a fix.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest you check the 'handleDeleteTopicsUsingNames' method in the 'MockAdminClient' class. At the moment, on line 584, an item is deleted from the collection iterated over 'Iterator'. In the same line, a UUID object is deleted from the 'topicIds' collection when it handles the 'String' objects.\r\n\r\nIn the 'LogicalKeyValueSegment' class, the 'prefixKeyFormatter' object is executed through both synchronized and unsynchronized methods. The code seems suspicious.\r\n\r\nIn the 'Sensor' class, the 'metrics' collection is executed through both synchronized and unsynchronized methods. I would recommend paying attention to this code too.\r\n\r\nThe PVS Studio static analyzer has detected these suspicious code fragments. They were described in the following article: https://pvs-studio.com/en/blog/posts/java/1171/.\r\n\r\nThe fixes of potential NPEs from the article have already been committed: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/17541.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

rack-aware partition assignor's design have obvious two significant flaws:\r\n\r\n1. Rely on the Kafka broker side to enable the configuration: replica.selector.class -> RackAwareReplicaSelector. This breaks the agreement that the Partition Assignor can be customized independently by the client.\r\n2. It destroys the read-write consistency principle of Kafka, leading to load imbalance and many other side effects.\r\n\r\nThis improvement of merge request is based on the following ideas:\r\nAlways read messages from the leader of the broker, that is, do not enable replica.selector.class\r\n, it can be aligned based only on the rack information of the leader, so that balance can be achieved first. In the case of balance, the same rack partition allocation strategy as the leader should be given priority as much as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n-

applications use SSL/TLS to connect with Kafka brokers in order to implement secured communication. The clients initiate SSL communication with Kafka brokers using the SSL Engine constructed from the ssl.* properties pointing to key store and trust store. This PR addresses couple of important enhancements related to how the key store is loaded for secured communication with Kafka brokers.\r\n\r\n**Problem :**\r\nMost of the container platforms such as PCF where the client applications are deployed set key store and trust store are environment variables with Base64 encoded PEM. Kafka clients expect the key store and trust store to be file system artefacts. This introduces custom logic to read these environment variables and create a key store / trust store out of that.\r\n\r\n**Solution :**\r\nThis can be solved by implementing loading the key store directly from environment variables as input stream. Two new configs ssl.keystore.as.string and ssl.truststore.as.string are added to indicate loading the key stores from these environment variables. When the values are true, it indicates the ssl.keystore.location and ssl.trustore.location are pointing to environment variables instead of paths.\r\n\r\nExample configuration:\r\nssl.truststore.as.string=true\r\nssl.keystore.type=JKS\r\nssl.truststore.location=${KEYSTORE} // populate this as an environment variable\r\nssl.keystore.as.string=true\r\nssl.truststore.type=JKS\r\nssl.keystore.location= ${TRUSTSTORE} // populate this as an environment variable\r\n\r\nAll unit tests are passing and added a new test to verify that the base64 encoded string works with the code changes. No changes were made to any other unit tests.","created_at":"2024-10-21T05:54:10Z","updated_at":"2025-01-20T03:36:31Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3d0e3c07f8da3fb09dbb7fc24e360c6b2cfa24a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

applications use SSL/TLS to connect with Kafka brokers in order to implement secured communication. The clients initiate SSL communication with Kafka brokers using the SSL Engine constructed from the ssl.* properties pointing to key store and trust store. This PR addresses couple of important enhancements related to how the key store is loaded for secured communication with Kafka brokers.\r\n\r\n**Problem :**\r\nMost of the times, the key store on the client side contains single key. But when the key store contains multiple keys, in order to avoid SSL handshake issues or authorization issues communicating with Kafka brokers, it is required to choose the right key from the key store.\r\n**Solution :**\r\nThe key can be identified via key alias while constructing the SSL engine. This requires client to provide a new property ssl.keystore.alias that points to the key alias within the key store. The key manager implementation is modified to return the named key to be used for building the SSL Engine.\r\n\r\nExample configuration:\r\nssl.keystore.alias=<alias.name>\r\n\r\nAshutosh Gijare and Moreshwar Dayte from Mastercard have contributed to this implementation\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-21T04:37:15Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T03:36:19Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"91e9dc3042831a264fccc53c0583da21bef9d82b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2129035451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTI5MDM1NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kip","name":"kip","color":"a01d16","default":false,"description":"Requires
