Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11706](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11706)\r\n(Test scenarios helping to understand and review the changes are added as comment on the ticket)\r\n\r\nAs many Versioned Flows are imported multiple times but used with in somewhat different circumstances (such as: different endpoints, databases, etc.), it would make sense to give the user the possibility to import flows in a way that their Parameter Context become independent from the other instances. In order to achieve this a new checkbox will be added to the Import Version window which makes it possible to decide for the user if she wants to keep the existing Parameter Contexts (bounding the parameters to the potentially existing instances) or she wants to create a new set of Parameter Contexts making the flow parametrised independently.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11717](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11717) Updates the minimum required Java version to 17.0.6.\r\n\r\nRequiring Java 17 includes setting the minimum version for the Maven Enforcer Plugin, setting the Maven Compiler Plugin release version to 17, and removing Java 11 workflows from GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include changing `yield` to `this.yield` since `yield` is now a reserved keyword in Java 17. The Groovy Eclipse Compiler plugin must be version 3.9.0, which is not available in Maven Central, requiring the Plugin Repository reference to JFrog.\r\n\r\nMaking Java 17 the minimum required version for the upcoming NiFi 2.0.0 major release aligns with the [developer list discussion](https://lists.apache.org/thread/3d30xdntkfwc1lckn0qf1bkzkzdlv9w3) highlighting the Long-Term Support policy of Java 17 in contrast to the impending end of premier support for Java 11 in September 2023.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11715](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11715) There are TODO comments in PutDatabaseRecord and DistributedMapCacheLookupService to remove support for user-defined

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11713](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11713) Removes deprecated ECMAScript support from the main branch following deprecation of JavaScript support in NiFi 1.22.0.\r\n\r\nThis removal aligns with deprecation and removal of the Nashorn engine from Java 15 and following as described in [JEP 372](https://openjdk.org/jeps/372). Future JavaScript support should be evaluated separately through external integration as opposed to bundling the Nashorn engine with the NiFi binaries.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11712](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11712) Removes the `java.net.preferIPv4Stack` property from the default `bootstrap.conf` and related scripts.\r\n\r\nThe Java [Networking Properties](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/doc-files/net-properties.html) describes IPv4 and IPv6 configuration options, noting that the default behavior supports both protocol versions. With various improvements in library support, disabling IPv6 should not be the default setting for new installations of NiFi 2.0.\r\n\r\nRemoving this default setting does not prevent deployments from

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11696](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11696) Upgrades Bouncy Castle dependencies from 1.71 to [1.74](https://www.bouncycastle.org/releasenotes.html#r1rv74).\r\n\r\nBouncy Castle 1.74 does not include the defunct SIKE algorithm, which avoids expanding the library size as occurred in versions 1.72 and 1.73.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include adjusting `nifi-repository-encryption` classes to use `commons-codec` for hexadecimal decoding instead of Bouncy Castle, and removing exclusions and

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11689](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11689) Adds the [Apache Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) scripts with Maven 3.9.2 for consistent Maven versioning across build platforms.\r\n\r\nChanges include updating GitHub workflows to use Maven Wrapper instead of the available Maven version to ensure the same version of Maven for all platforms.\r\n\r\nThe Maven Wrapper scripts use the `only-script` option as described in the documentation, which relies on platform commands to download the configured Maven version.\r\n\r\nThe addition of Maven Wrapper does not interfere with standard Maven installations, but provides the recommended approach for consistent builds.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11680](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11680) Corrects `PeerChannel` methods used for Cluster Connection Load Balancing to avoid potential `BufferOverflowException` errors with the Bouncy Castle Security Provider for TLS.\r\n\r\nThe Bouncy Castle [ProvSSLSessionBase](https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/blob/master/tls/src/main/java/org/bouncycastle/jsse/provider/ProvSSLSessionBase.java) uses a more coarse-grained calculation for Application Buffer Size and Packet Buffer Size than the standard JDK [SSLSessionImpl](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/java.base/share/classes/sun/security/ssl/SSLSessionImpl.java). As a result of this difference in behavior, the `PeerChannel.encrypt()` method can expand the encrypted destination buffer greater than the SSLSession Application Buffer Size. The current approach works with the standard JDK implementation, but results in failures with files greater than 500 KB when using the Bouncy Castle Provider.\r\n\r\nThe revised approach calculates the expanded size of the intermediate prepared buffer based on the size of the destination buffer, as opposed to using the SSLSession Application Buffer Size.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11673](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11673) Removes legacy TLS protocol versions from the `TlsConfiguration` interface along with methods based on evaluation of Java version information.\r\n\r\nPrevious logic defaulted to TLSv1.2 for Java 8 and TLSv1.3 for Java 11 when calling several helper methods on `TlsConfiguration`. The `TlsPlatform` utility class provides feature-based detection and has been used in a number of framework and extension components. With the removal of Java 8 support from the main branch, the Java version number checking is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include applying the `SSL Protocol` property to the HTTP Notification Service for NiFi Bootstrap and removing test methods no longer necessary with the standardization of available TLS protocol versions.\r\n\r\nFor cluster socket communication, the `TlsPlatform` methods replace the Java version-based methods from `TlsConfiguration` while providing equivalent functionality.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11655](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11655) This PR fixes how floats and doubles are generated when using the Schema Text property in GenerateRecord. The bug was that all types were coerced to DecimalDataType which is not compatible for float and double types.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11656](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11656) Removes deprecated `GetAzureQueueStorage` and `PutAzureQueueStorage` Processors along with `AzureStorageCredentialsControllerService` and related implementations as part of NiFi 2.0 release goals.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include removing the remaining legacy Microsoft Azure Storage SDK

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11630](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11630) Deprecates the `ECMAScript` and `python` Script Engine options for scripted components.\r\n\r\nThe [JEP 335](https://openjdk.org/jeps/335) deprecated the Nashorn engine for Java 11 and Java 17 does not include Nashorn.\r\n\r\nThe current main branch includes framework support for native Python Processors, providing a better alternative to scripted components based on [Jython](https://www.jython.org/).\r\n\r\nThe deprecation includes adding `DEPRECATED` to the Script Engine property display name and logging a deprecation warning when starting a component that uses one of the deprecated Script Engines.\r\n\r\nSubsequent efforts can remove these Script Engine options from the main branch while this pull request target the support branch for version 1 releases.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11629](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11629) Adds a new `Socket Write Timeout` property to `InvokeHTTP` with a default value of 15 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe new timeout provides a way to set the [writeTimeout](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-ok-http-client/-builder/write-timeout/) on the OkHttp client, which defaults to 10 seconds when not otherwise configured. The new default value of 15 seconds matches the default `Socket Read Timeout` property on `InvokeHTTP` and should be sufficient for standard use cases. Supporting a longer write timeout will enable compensating potential issues when sending large requests over slow network connections.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11614](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11614) Improves property validation for the `JndiJmsConnectionFactoryProvider` Controller Service with a set of allowed URL schemes and disallowed Context Factory classes.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation only checks for a configured value with standard properties, but the new validation narrows the scope to provide better validation prior to enabling the provider.\r\n\r\nThe initial set of allowed URL schemes is based on the [ActiveMQ Using JMS](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/using-jms.html) documentation. The new URL validation narrows the scope of potential values, which should be noted in migration guidance, providing a clearer set of supported values\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the
