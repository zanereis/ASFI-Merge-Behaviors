Currently, we are utilizing the `try_number` to compute the `next_poke_interval`, which has an impact on the new `reschedule_date`.\r\n\r\nAlthough the two issues are closely linked, we may choose to divide them into separate pull requests based on the final implementation.\r\n\r\nI will fix the unit tests, add new tests and add the migration scripts for the new column(s) once everything works as expected in my test

provider brings protobuf dependency down to <4 and we are gearing up to updating it everywhere else. Protobuf3 support ends in Q2 2023 for Python https://protobuf.dev/support/version-support/#python\r\n\r\nYandex is the last provider that we do not closely collaborate with on fixing it\r\n\r\n* Gogle provider dependencies are actively upgraded to latest version by Google led team: #30067 (some of the libraries are already updated) with target to update all dependencies by mid-May\r\n* Apache-Beam has already merged protobuf4 support https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/25874 with the target of relasing it in 2.47.0 mid-May\r\n* The mysql-connector-python in MySQL provider is already turned into optional dependency: #30487\r\n\r\nThe only remaining dependency limiting us to protobuf 3 (<3.21) is yandexcloud. We've opened an issue to yandexcloud\r\nhttps://github.com/yandex-cloud/python-sdk/issues/71 3 weeks ago and while there was an initial interest, there is no progress on the issue, therefore - in order to prepare for running all the tests and final migration to protobuf4 we need to suspend Yandex provider - following the suspension process we agreed and got a LAZY CONSENSUS on in\r\nthe https://lists.apache.org/thread/g8b3k028qhzgw6c3yz4jvmlc67kcr9hj mailing list discussion.\r\n\r\nThe yandex provider can be removed from suspension by a PR reverting this change once yandexcloud dependency removes the protobuf limitation in their release and PR reverting this change (and fixing all tests and static check that will be needed) is the way it can be done.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#28452\r\n\r\nChanging the way docker service logs are consumed by using a buffer and repeatedly querying the docker API without the 'follow' option. This 'follow' option  makes the request hang waiting for input even if the service has ended and can only be resolved upstream by the native docker API. We bypass this deficiency by polling the API.\r\nTested on a production DockerSwarm cluster. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

on this previous pull request: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/29767\r\n\r\nAs stated on Slack Dev channel Pip 23.1 has been with significant improvements to the backtracking process. For example  I tested installing apache-airflow[all]==1.10.13  using pypi-timemachine with the date set to 2020-12-02, I found that Pip 23.0.1 got stuck backtracking but Pip 23.1 was able to resolve the requirements and install relatively quickly.\r\n\r\nSo Pip 23.1 should help with dev processes of installing without constraints or generating constraints.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

workday calendar expected pandas to be available and it is part of our examples, however Airflow does not have pandas as a core dependency, so in case someone does not have pandas installed, importing of the workday example would fail.\r\n\r\nThis change makes pandas optional and fallbacks to regular working days for the example in case it is not available (including warning about it). It also fixes a slight inefficiency where the USFederalHoliday calendar has been created every time next workday was calculated.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

another operator.\r\n\r\nI added that transfer operator by mimicry with the existing `BigQueryToMySqlOperator`.\r\n\r\nI am aware this operator adds duplication with `BigQueryToMySqlOperator` and `BigQueryToMsSqlOperator`. The implementation is basically the same. On the other hand, I feel that factorizing that code would make it unreadable.\r\n\r\nThe `BigQueryToMySqlOperator` had a deprecated argument: `delegate_to`. I removed it from the `Postgres` adaptation.\r\n\r\nI noticed the `BigQueryToMySqlOperator` is referenced in `airflow/contrib/operators/__init__.py` (`__deprecated_classes`) and in `tests/always/test_project_structure.py` (`MISSING_EXAMPLES_FOR_CLASSES`). I am not 100% sure of what those references mean but I guess the new `BigQueryToPostgresOperator` doesn't need to be referenced

`priority=` is available in `run_query()` function within `BigQueryHook` class but can't be set when class is created.\r\n\r\nThis causes problems when you're using `SQLExecuteQueryOperator` since `priority` is missing from class constructor, you won't be able to pass in with `hook_params={\"priority\":\"BATCH\"}`. Trying to workaround using `hook_params={\"api_resource_configs\": {\"query\": {\"priority\": \"BATCH\"}}\"` will error on `_api_resource_configs_duplication_check()` since `priority` is defaulted to

XComArg's `get_task_map_length()` should only return an integer when the *entire* task has finished. However, before this patch, it may attempt to count a mapped upstream even when some (or all!) of its expanded tis are still unfinished, resulting its downstream to be expanded prematurely. This patch adds an additional check before we count upstream results to ensure all the upstreams are actually finished.\r\n\r\nFix #28973.\r\n\r\nOne thing I don’t like in this patch is it adds an additional SQL query for each resolution. I have a hunch the two queries can be combined, but I’m not sure

up of https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30373, you can only look at the last commit that allows to display the affected task instances in a table for more visibility when performing an action in the grid view.\r\n\r\nI wish we could serialize the data using a standardized schema for both `api_connexion` and `views`. In such case being able to use a shared `TaskInstanceSchema` would be helpful for consistency. I don't think we need many representations of a serialized TaskInstance (or any other object) for the webserver.\r\n\r\nRight now `api_connexion` and `views` are well separated, coupling the  two by importing this schema into the view feels wrong but maybe having some shared schema in a parent folder could prove useful. Also at the moment `TaskInstanceSchema` works on a tuple with SLA miss, and cannot dump bare 'TaskInstance' objects which can be an issue when you don't have the sla miss for serialization.

pull request introduces a retry mechanism to handle Vault connection failures more gracefully. By employing the urllib3.util.Retry class, we can configure the retry behavior for specific HTTP status codes that are more likely to be transient, such as 412 (Precondition Failed), 500 (Internal Server Error), 502 (Bad Gateway), and 503 (Service Unavailable).\r\n\r\nThese changes are implemented within the Vault client file, using the hvac library, to enhance the robustness and reliability of the connection with Vault. The hvac library's Client class allows for the injection of a custom Session object, which we can configure with an HTTPAdapter instance to apply our desired retry behavior.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the [hvac documentation](https://hvac.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced_usage.html#retrying-failed-requests), thoughtful retrying of failed requests is crucial for a seamless experience with Vault, especially in the context of eventual consistency. Vault may return a 412 status code when data is not yet available on the node where the request was made. In addition, retrying 5xx status codes is generally advisable.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, Airflow's integration with Vault becomes more resilient and fault-tolerant, improving the overall user experience and stability of the system.","created_at":"2023-04-13T16:03:06Z","updated_at":"2023-06-14T19:42:50Z","closed_at":"2023-06-14T19:42:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"28bcc22d766618e0239763a4fd21da9cbb601b3f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/30628/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/30628/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/30628/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/165a426b0e674136cb8cfbe28e2dae40a0085c20","head":{"label":"pawalat:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"165a426b0e674136cb8cfbe28e2dae40a0085c20","user":{"login":"pawalat","id":91884251,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXoK2w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91884251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat","html_url":"https://github.com/pawalat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627506887,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWb-xw","name":"airflow","full_name":"pawalat/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pawalat","id":91884251,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXoK2w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91884251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat","html_url":"https://github.com/pawalat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawalat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pawalat/airflow","description":"Apache

Description\r\nThis PR attaches the logGroomer sidecar pod when using a standalone `dag processor`. This is to prevent scheduler logs from growing infinitely in the `logs` directory of that `dag processor` pod. \r\n\r\nIn fact, one of the Airflow clusters my team uses had about `3.5 TiB` of scheduler logs accumulated in the emptyDir of a `dag processor` pod, which reduced the ephemeral-storage availability on that node to the point of pod eviction, resulting in a pod eviction.\r\n\r\n```\r\nairflow@airflow-test-dag-processor-78f9bfdb88-hmckb:/opt/airflow/logs$ ls\r\nscheduler\r\nairflow@airflow-test-dag-processor-78f9bfdb88-hmckb:/opt/airflow/logs$ du -sh\r\n3.5T\t     .\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe haven't figured out why the standalone `dag processor` was accumulating scheduler logs, but we think it's a good idea to attach a logGroomer sidecar like any other scheduler pod or worker pod to prevent this from happening in the first place. \r\n\r\nIn this PR, we've modified the helm chart to attach a logGroomer to the standalone `dag processor`.\r\n\r\nRead

Generally,  `timeoutSeconds` should be smaller than `periodSeconds`. Here are a [SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63308717/what-is-the-role-of-timeoutseconds-in-kubernetes-liveness-readiness-probes) addressing this issue and a [blog post](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/liveness-and-readiness-probes) detailing the Liveness and Readiness Probes. Furthermore, some specific k8s implementations such as GKE [do not allow](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/health-check-concepts#probes)  `timeoutSeconds` > `periodSeconds`.\r\n\r\n> The timeout is the amount of time that Google Cloud waits for a response to a probe. Its value must be less than or equal to the check interval. Units are seconds.\r\n\r\nFinally, the webserver probes are the only ones with default values where  `timeoutSeconds` > `periodSeconds`.\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

Pydantic representation of the ORM models is only used in AIP-44 in-progress feature, and we are moving to a new seialization implementation (more modular) in a near feature so in order to not unecessarily extend features in old serialization, but allow to test AIP-44, we are moving the use_pydantic_models parameter and it's implementation under _ENABLE_AIP_44 feature flag, so that it is not used accidentally.\r\n\r\nWe will eventually remove it and add Pydantic serialization to the new serialization implementation.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is a further fix to vendor-in google-ads library:\r\n\r\n* moving from _vendor to google_vendor is needed to keep the tree structure separate from `google` package used in google provider. If we do not do that, ads library will find \"google\" package when walking up the tree and will determine that this is the \"top\" google package\r\n\r\n* dynamic imports of ads library imports have been updated to also import from the vendored-in library\r\n\r\n* only v12 version is supported\r\n\r\nCloses: #30526\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Param defaults to False for backwards compatibility. If set to True, it returns a subclass of PageIterator (either a RowIterator in the case of list_rows or a HTTPIterator in the case of get_datasets_list). Some notes on PageIterator: https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/latest/_modules/google/api_core/page_iterator.html\r\n\r\nI also noticed the retry parameter was missing from list_rows. Added that as well and set it to the DEFAULT_RETRY object which is what it is set at if nothing is passed so should be backwards compatible but allow users to override if needed. -->

adding a feature flag for AIP-44 I noticed that due to a weird naming we have in tests, the \"api_internal\" tests were actually excluded from running - this was due to a combination of factors:\r\n\r\n* When API tests are are run, only \"api\" and \"api_connexion\" were added to API_tests\r\n* We already have \"api\" folder in \"tests\" (for experimental api)\r\n* finding \"Other\" tests should cover it but it exluded \"api\" tests but the way it is implemented, it took the \"api\" prefix and excluded all the test directories that were starting with \"api\" (including \"api_internal/*\" ones\r\n\r\nThis change addresses it twofold:\r\n\r\n* The \"api_internal\" tests are added explicitly to the \"API\" test type\r\n* The \"tests/api\" folder with tests for the experimental API has been renamed to \"api_experimental\" (including integration tests)\r\n\r\nThis should set the \"internal_api\" tests to run in the API test type, and renaming the \"api\" to api_experimental should avoid accidental skipping the tests in case someone adds \"tests/api_SOMETHING\" in the future.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
