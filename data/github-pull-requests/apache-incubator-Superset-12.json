SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSince #29791 the [webpack.config.js](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/548d543efe81ecd6f0a6657550230b765ab4d955/superset-frontend/webpack.config.js) file now requires that the translation files are present when running the build. This change simply moves the copy of the translation files before the `npm run build` step.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBeforehand, an error printed was printed, although it doesn't seem to stop the build, that can cause confusion as to whether something is wrong with the build:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n#19 [superset-node  7/12] RUN npm run build\r\n#19 0.291\r\n#19

href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect/releases\">reselect's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.1.1</h2>\n<p>This <strong>patch release</strong> fixes behavior of <code>resultEqualityCheck</code> in <code>weakMapMemoize</code>, fixes the case of <code>lruMemoize</code> being given a <code>maxSize</code> less than 1, and tweaks the internal implementation of <code>lruMemoize</code>.  (We've also updated our general build tooling.)</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<h3>Bug fixes</h3>\n<p>Previously, providing the <code>resultEqualityCheck</code> option to <code>weakMapMemoize</code> resulted in it being called with empty objects as part of the initialization / dev check process. That could be an issue if your comparison function expected different values.

SUMMARY\r\nUnder https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27631 under https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/20300\r\nIt also fixes an issue not totally resolved here https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/29981, which is required for OAuth2 to work for trino.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

I created a Keycloak client for trino and added this configuration in `superset_docker_config.py`:\r\n```python\r\nDATABASE_OAUTH2_REDIRECT_URI = \"http://localhost:8088/api/v1/database/oauth2/\"\r\nDATABASE_OAUTH2_CLIENTS = {\r\n    'Trino': {\r\n        'id': 'trino',\r\n        'secret': ''<some-secret>',\r\n        'scope': 'openid email offline_access roles profile',\r\n        'redirect_uri': 'http://localhost:8088/api/v1/database/oauth2/',\r\n        'authorization_request_uri': 'https://<the url of keycloak deploy>/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/auth',\r\n        'token_request_uri': 'https://<the url of keycloak deploy>/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token',\r\n       'request_content_type': 'data' # keycloak doesn't accept application/json body.\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Database configured via UI: with following settings:\r\n```json\r\ntrino://<trino_url>:443/tpcds\r\n\r\n{\"connect_args\":{\"http_scheme\":\"https\"}}\r\n\r\nImpersonate: true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/20300\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\n### Need feedback with:\r\nWe still need to trigger this OAuth2 dance in, at least, 2 contexts (I don't know much about superset, possibility there are more):\r\n- Automatic attempt to list schemas and tables\r\n- Testing Connection when adding the database: **temp**: previous OAuth2 features implemented and already merged don't include a way to trigger this flow when adding a connection via UI. For this reason, I had to hack the test_connection.py so I'm allowed to

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n[SIP-99](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/25048) introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24969 the amazing `@transaction` decorator, which transparently manages transactions in Superset in order to avoid eager commits.\r\n\r\n[SIP-85](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/20300) introduced a mechanism for authenticating to databases via OAuth2, using exceptions to signalize to the frontend from deep in the backend that the user needs to authenticate by following a link. These exceptions are benign, and carry in their `extra` payload (see [SIP-40](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9194)) the URL used for authentication, among others.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, when adding a database that has OAuth2 enabled we need to allow certain exceptions to still commit, while raising them. This allows the database to be created succesfully, while signalizing to the user that they still need to authenticate. This is needed because OAuth2 tokens are stored associated with a database ID, so it must exist _a priori_.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the `@transaction` decorator to allow an optional group of exceptions that should trigger a commit before being re-raised. It's part of a bigger work to add support for OAuth2 to Snowflake, still in progress but already tested end-to-end.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhile working on a Jinja time filtering feature, I noticed a curious quirk in how `get_since_until_from_time_range` works:\r\n- When `time_range=\"No filter\"` it returns `(None, None)` for `since` and `until` respectively\r\n- For `time_range=None` it returns `(None, datetime(current_date))`\r\n\r\nI don't see any reason for this, and can only assume it's a quirk of how the complex function works for other more intricate time ranges. Therefore, I feel it prudent to change the behavior, so that `None` and `\"No filter\"` both returns the same value.\r\n\r\nLet's see if this change breaks some tests - if not, I can only assume this isn't intended, but rather an artifact of the current logic.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nI add **webhook** as a new selectable report type. \r\n\r\n![Képernyőkép ekkor: 2024-08-13 11-24-05](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbadedc9-052c-460f-b05b-3779aaa20069)\r\n\r\nBy the use of webhook the user can post csv/png/pdf to any endpoint, with some informative parameters as:\r\n- name of the report\r\n- id of the report\r\n- report type (chart, or dashboard)\r\n- content id\r\n- content format\r\n\r\nFor security reasons I made a new optional parameter: WEBHOOK_SECRET. It's a secret string between the Superset and the webhook endpoint. In the case where WEBHOOK_SECRET is filled, Superset adds an \"X-Webhook-Signature\" parameter to the header of the post call, which hashes the json data to be sent. The receiving party can verify that the party sending the webhook is the real sender by hashing the received json data and comparing it with the sending party's \"X-Webhook-Signature\" parameter. If the two parameters do not match, the receiving party may reject the call because the sender is not the supposed host.\r\n\r\n![Képernyőkép ekkor: 2024-08-13 12-04-57](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99f1dcb2-d739-4c25-b8f5-4678e00717e1)\r\n\r\nOn the report log, we can get feedback about the successful, and not successful requests as well.\r\n\r\n![Képernyőkép ekkor: 2024-08-13 12-27-31](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6041296a-07b1-4d0e-958a-8ff73078bac3)\r\n\r\nI'm happy to share my code with you guys!\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0. (optional) Fill the WEBHOOK_SECRET input parameter in the config file\r\n1. On the Alerts & reports page, press the \"+ Report\" or \"+ Alert\" button.\r\n2. On the notification panel, you can select Webhook as Notification method\r\n3. Fill the webhook endpoint url\r\n4. Fill all the mandatory input \r\n\r\nBy the result you will get the selectend chart/dashboard file on your webhook endpoint with some informative parameters as:\r\n- name of the report\r\n- id of the report\r\n- report type (chart, or dashboard)\r\n- content id\r\n- content format\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

SUMMARY\r\nAfter the initial version of the time comparison feature for Table and Big Number  we introduced a migration to upgrade old charts to the new comparison controls, however, during that upgrade a table that never had comparison in it was wrongly showing Time Comparison Data.\r\n\r\nThis PR is fixing the migration so we can properly upgrade such old tables if needed, also we extend our tests to not only consider charts that have the enabled_time_comparison flag set to True.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nOld version of Chart using Time Comparison once but then removing it from the controls:\r\n<img width=\"1911\" alt=\"initial\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d82c73d-3160-4bc4-983e-9a172bb8bcd6\">\r\n<img

Create a table chart with a version of the time comparison where Enable Time Comparison checkbox was used\r\n2. Run a comparison data (Mark the checkbox and select a time range)\r\n3. Unmark the checkbox and run the chart data again so your chart has no longer comparison info\r\n4. Use more updated version and run the migrations so your table is upgraded\r\n5. You must not see time comparison data in the table.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\nFixes the dashboard list row height to match the height of other lists. This problem was introduced by the [Slack Avatar integration](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27849).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nAs we can see the row height is not the same between the dashboard and charts list which makes the avatars close to the row separator in the dashboard list.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1784\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-27 at 11 20 21\"

waiting for a `docker-compose build`, I decided to go and skip the long steps around the frontend buildsthat are not required while in dev mode while using  `docker-compose` where we mount the local repo and build it inside docker.\r\n\r\nNote that it's always tricky to have conditional logic in docker files as things aren't procedural. I took the approach of using and `ARG` and having conditions in `RUN` commands which accomplishes the goal of skipping the frontend builds in DEV_MODE=true. \r\n\r\nchanges:\r\n    - skip `npm ci` when DEV_MODE=true\r\n    - skip `npm run build` when DEV_MODE=true\r\n    - introduce an ARG for INCLUDE_FIREFOX, skip by default\r\n    - introduce an ARG for INCLUDE_CHROMIUM, include in `dev` layer by default - added a note in `UPDATING.md` even though people shouldn't really use the `dev` target from our Dockerfile.","created_at":"2024-08-27T01:25:03Z","updated_at":"2024-09-04T15:52:20Z","closed_at":"2024-09-04T15:52:16Z","merged_at":"2024-09-04T15:52:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"cc39afef46ec9cb826b5bc17250b637fd8202c86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":718573661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MTg1NzM2NjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/need:more-info","name":"need:more-info","color":"fff3b1","default":false,"description":"Requires

SUMMARY\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28122, all methods that take a `table_name` and a `schema` were updated to received a `Table` instance. Unfortunately, the Jinja context calls to partition methods were not updated breaking the functionality. This PR fixes the problem by making the necessary changes.\r\n\r\nIt's not in the scope of this PR to potentially support catalogs, which was the reason for the Table instance changes but this might be needed. @betodealmeida \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI should be sufficient.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ]

dashboards and charts affected by the (potential) deletion of a dataset/database.\r\n\r\nThe links to these assets all open in a _single_ (named) new window.\r\n\r\nIt also does a little cleanup along the way:\r\n* modal is now always centered (so it scrolls sensibly)\r\n* the \"delete\" button is now the \"Delete\" button\r\n* Highlights the name of the dataset/database that's getting deleted... this seems important.\r\n* Updates the .pot file since some strings are getting tweaked in there.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nIn Flask App Builder, menu translation is already integrated using the label field. However, in Apache Superset, during the initial setup, the label field was translated according to the default language. Upon switching to a different language, the system attempted to translate the already translated value. Since the translated key (in this case, Russian) did not exist in the dictionary, this caused an issue. Therefore, I removed the translation from the application initialization process.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n![Screencastfrom26 08 2024211640-ezgif com-video-to-gif-converter (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c0614dc-2cbf-4eb3-a0c0-2c909c68d3af)\r\n![Screencastfrom26 08 2024211805-ezgif com-video-to-gif-converter (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce76b0d8-42aa-486f-8bef-f3f7a80eaaeb)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1.

href=\"https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/blob/4.0.8/CHANGELOG.md\">micromatch's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>[4.0.8] - 2024-08-22</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>backported CVE-2024-4067 fix (from v4.0.6) over to 4.x branch</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[4.0.7] - 2024-05-22</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>this is basically v4.0.5, with some README updates</li>\n<li><strong>it is vulnerable to CVE-2024-4067</strong></li>\n<li>Updated braces to v3.0.3 to avoid CVE-2024-4068</li>\n<li>does NOT break API compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[4.0.6] - 2024-05-21</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>hasBraces</code> to check if a pattern contains braces.</li>\n<li>Fixes CVE-2024-4067</li>\n<li><strong>BREAKS API COMPATIBILITY</strong></li>\n<li>Should be labeled as a major release, but it's not.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[4.0.1 - 4.0.5]</h2>\n<h2>[4.0.0] - 2019-03-20</h2>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds support for <code>options.onMatch</code>. See the readme for details</li>\n<li>Adds support for <code>options.onIgnore</code>. See the readme for details</li>\n<li>Adds support for <code>options.onResult</code>. See the readme for details</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breaking changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Require Node.js &gt;= 8.6</li>\n<li>Removed support for passing an array of brace patterns to <code>micromatch.braces()</code>.</li>\n<li>To strictly enforce closing brackets (for <code>{</code>, <code>[</code>, and <code>(</code>), you must now use <code>strictBrackets=true</code> instead of <code>strictErrors</code>.</li>\n<li><code>cache</code> - caching and all related options and methods have been removed</li>\n<li><code>options.unixify</code> was renamed to <code>options.windows</code></li>\n<li><code>options.nodupes</code> Was removed. Duplicates are always removed by default. You can override this with custom behavior by using the <code>onMatch</code>, <code>onResult</code> and <code>onIgnore</code> functions.</li>\n<li><code>options.snapdragon</code> was removed, as snapdragon is no longer used.</li>\n<li><code>options.sourcemap</code> was removed, as snapdragon is no longer used, which provided sourcemap support.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[3.0.0] - 2017-04-11</h2>\n<p>Complete overhaul, with 36,000+ new unit tests validated against actual output generated by Bash and minimatch. More specifically, 35,000+ of the tests:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>micromatch results are directly compared to bash results</li>\n<li>in rare cases, when micromatch and bash disagree, micromatch's results are compared to minimatch's results</li>\n<li>micromatch is much more accurate than minimatch, so there were cases where I had to make assumptions. I'll try to document these.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This refactor introduces a parser and compiler that are supersets of more granular parsers and compilers from other sub-modules. Each of these sub-modules has a singular responsibility and focuses on a certain type of matching that aligns with a specific part of the Bash &quot;expansion&quot; API.</p>\n<p>These sub-modules work like plugins to seamlessly create the micromatch parser/compiler, so that strings are parsed in one pass, an <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/099c8914f56529f75bc757cc9e5e8e2a\">AST is created</a>, then a new string is generated by the compiler.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

SUMMARY\r\nThe time comparison feature that's being used in Table and Big Number charts does not support Human Readable dates and it's very limited on what date formats it  supports. \r\n\r\nNow the API supports sending `inherit` or a `YYYY-MM-DD` date as offset value so we can rely on the existing API to parse any date before computing the custom or inherit offset.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

Set up a Table Chart with a date filter with value: `Aug 2024` until `tomorrow``\r\n2. Select inherit time shift\r\n3. The chart must display the correct data and the comparison label\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nIn the async query, the `extra` field of the pulling data is in object form, and when the result is completed, it fails to verify equality due to shallow equality checks.\r\nThis caused unnecessary over-rendering of the result panel, so this commit resolved the issue by comparing the extra field separately.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen table metadata changes (e.g. due to queries launched in Superset or other external changes) the user has no convenient way to force a refresh of the data for their `TabState`. The metadata is persisted even across sessions and will never update if the user stays on the current tab.\r\n\r\nThis feature is a first step to make this experience better by adding a refresh button for each table that allows a manual refresh.\r\n\r\n**Future improvements:**\r\n- Automatically refresh when query is _likely_ to change the metadata\r\n- Refresh metadata from time to time\r\n- Do not persist the metadata for a SQL Lab tab forever: Maybe remove `TableSchema` and instead use a shared cache with well defined expiry\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f3b1ee1-cf5f-4e5d-96fa-8332bff8d35c\" alt=\"Refresh Button in Action\" style=\"max-width: 100%; display: inline-block;\" data-target=\"animated-image.originalImage\" width=\"400\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Load SQL Lab and expand a table\r\n2. Change the table (e.g. add column)\r\n3. Click refresh button\r\n4. **Expected**: New column appears\r\n5. Refresh the whole page\r\n6. **Expected**: Column is still there (asserts the server-side `TableSchema` was properly updated)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with

v10)\r\n   * `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin` (v6 -> v9)\r\n      * This major version no longer runs `eslint` against codebase and since CI already includes `eslint` step, I've removed it from Webpack config. Lmk if this is OK to go forward\r\n* docs\r\n   *  `antd` (v4 -> v5)\r\n* superset-frontend/packages/generator-superset\r\n   * `cross-env` (v5 -> v7)\r\n* superset-frontend/plugins/plugin-chart-echarts\r\n   * `echarts` (v5.4 -> v5.5)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhen a lock occurs due to an update caused by the Celery worker in the query table, the updated_since fetch sometimes ends up being running for an extended period of time.\r\nAlthough a timeout has been set, the API abort has been omitted, which results in the frontend continuing the action, but the existing request remains in a pending state.\r\n\r\nThis commit ensures that abort is executed when a rejection occurs, preventing such issues.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED
