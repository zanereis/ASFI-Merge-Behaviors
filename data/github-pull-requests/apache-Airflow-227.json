PR covers several small issues; \r\n\r\n* Locking breeze to v1.18 seems like a mistake as it;\r\n  1. Prevents testing k8s oriented operators that rely on CRDs such as the spark-on-k8s operator\r\n             which is an issue for many projects in 1.18 due to kubernetes/kubernetes#88076 \r\n             A few reference issues: \r\n             https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-on-k8s-operator/issues/921\r\n             https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues/3235\r\n             https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools/issues/444 \r\n  2. Prevents testing workloads on earlier, in-use versions ( EKS, for example, just got to 1.17 this month )\r\n\r\nI've added the latest versions from kind ( v1.17.5, v1.16.9 ) and updated the default version to v1.18.6\r\n\r\n* ``breeze kind-cluster recreate`` did not seem to work even though it's mentioned in the breeze docs. \r\nCurrently throws: \r\n```\r\nERROR: Unknown Kind Kubernetes cluster operation: 'recreate'\r\nShould be one of:\r\nstart stop restart status deploy test shell\r\n```\r\n\r\n*  ```breeze kind-cluster deploy``` had a typo in perform_kind_cluster_operation\r\n\r\n* kind-cluster kubectl version ignored KUBERNETES_VERSION ( typo )\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the

the checklist of always checked points. It seems that the checklist is redundant because it creates more confusion than good. So this PR proposes a new templated which:\r\n1. Focuses on description - if no comment is present in commit then there will be \r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nWhich I hope will be a call to action for authors. \r\n\r\n1. Reduces the amount of information that a new contributor has to digest. We just kindly remind about tests coverage and docs. The code quality will be verified by CI checks.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have the welcome bot that will provide more additional resources. \r\n\r\nThe template looks like this from Github PR editor:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n-->\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code change, Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in [UPDATING.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md).\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow this work in real life? If there's no comment in commit then the `**Add meaningful ...` line will be first. If there's a comment the line can be easily removed and I don't think this will cause any trouble. We can even make the boring cyborg remove it in case of description. \r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Unit tests coverage for changes (not needed for documentation changes)\r\n- [x] Target Github ISSUE in description if exists\r\n- [x] Commits follow \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\"\r\n- [x] Relevant documentation is updated including usage instructions.\r\n- [x] I will engage committers as explained in [Contribution Workflow

on https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/9850\r\n\r\nBefore this change, if DAG Serialization was enabled the Webserver would not update the DAGs once they are fetched from DB. The default worker_refresh_interval was `30` so whenever the gunicorn workers were restarted, they used to pull the updated DAGs when needed.\r\n\r\nThis change will allow us to have a large `worker_refresh_interval` (e.g 30 mins or even 1 day)\r\n\r\nPlease only review the last commit\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above

didn't use generic OpenID library because they are more difficult to use than Google library. On the other hand, we also need to implement the client in this module. Its implementation requires things that are Google Vendored, e.g. obtaining the Token ID using a metaserver.\r\n\r\nHopefully we will be able to come up with a more generic solution in the future, but this is a step forward.

#8703. Any feedback is very welcome!\r\n\r\nThere are some standing questions:\r\n\r\n1) What are your thoughts on isolating the JSON serialization logic in a separate \"lightweight\" module? My initial attempt was to use the existing `serialized_objects.py` module, without duplicating any code, following the suggestion from https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8703#issuecomment-623385925:\r\n```\r\n# Module: xcom.py\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.serialization.serialized_objects import BaseSerialization\r\n(...)\r\n# within the function `serialize_value`\r\n            dict_ = BaseSerialization.serialize_to_json(value)\r\n            return json.dumps(dict_).encode('UTF-8')\r\n(...)\r\n# within the function `deserialize_value`\r\n            dict_ = json.loads(result.value.decode('UTF-8'))\r\n            return BaseSerialization.from_dict(dict_)\r\n```\r\nHowever, this seems to have resulted in a circular dependency, which could be observed when running `pytest tests/models/test_xcom.py`:\r\n```\r\n______________________ ERROR collecting tests/models/test_xcom.py

`serialization/serialized_objects.py::BaseSerialization` to use the module so we avoid duplicating the logic.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x]

had a use for this sensor in project work, so I figured I'd contribute it to the repo. The S3UploadSessionCompleteSensor is essentially the same implementation as exists for GCS. The only things that changes is the hook call.\r\n\r\nThe S3UploadSessionCompleteSensor polls the number of files in a S3 bucket and verifies against the previous count. If the count does not change for a given interval, the sensor succeeds. \r\n\r\nSince the logic for the sensor is the same as GCS, I considered refactoring for code reuse, but I don't exactly understand how provider package dependencies work, so I opted for duplicating the code. Feel free to suggest an alternative approach if this does not seem adequate.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8119\r\n\r\nI added reference documentation to our documentation in Sphinx. I analyzed two [Swagger UI](https://petstore.swagger.io/#/) and [Redoc](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/#tag/pet) tools, but I decided to integrate Redoc for three reasons. \r\n\r\n - First of all, it is possible to add code samples of using the client API in different languages thanks to the [x-codesamples](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-codeSamples) extension. This will facilitate the use of this API very much and will also provide ready documentation for these clients.  Less duplicate documentation.  \r\n - Secondly, Redoc is just two files: 1 HTML and 1 JS, so its integration is very simple. :-D \r\n- A great contributor, an excellent developer - @ad-m uses this in [their projects](https://api.hyperone.com/docs). This is a great recommendation, which fully convinces me that this is a good choice.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nKamil Breguła\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR:

built-in function being used does not require comprehension and can work directly with a generator expression.\r\n\r\nUsing a generator expession within these functions is faster than using a

the decorator provide_session causes the function's result type to be ignored. Unfortunately, we cannot keep the full signature, because the parameter session has a dual character. Depending on the context, it is required and optional at the same time. It is possible that we can try to write some complex mypy plugin that will detect these situations and handle it correctly, but for now proposes a partial solution.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the
