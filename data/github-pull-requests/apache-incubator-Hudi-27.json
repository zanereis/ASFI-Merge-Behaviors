The completed rollback in the data table's timeline interferes with the partition validation in the metadata table validator. Only commits should be considered in the validation. See the following example.\r\nTimeline of DT and MDT:\r\n```\r\n╔═════╤═══════════════════╤═════════════╤═══════════╤═══════════════════╤═════════════╤═════════════╤═════════════╤═════════════╤═══════════╤═════════════╤═════════════╤═════════════╗\r\n║ No. │ Instant           │ Action      │ State     │ Rollback Info     │ Requested   │ Inflight    │ Completed   │ MT          │ MT        │ MT          │ MT          │ MT          ║\r\n║     │                   │             │           │                   │ Time        │ Time        │ Time        │ Action      │ State     │ Requested   │ Inflight    │ Completed   ║\r\n║     │                   │             │           │                   │             │             │             │             │           │ Time        │ Time        │ Time        ║\r\n╠═════╪═══════════════════╪═════════════╪═══════════╪═══════════════════╪═════════════╪═════════════╪═════════════╪═════════════╪═══════════╪═════════════╪═════════════╪═════════════╣\r\n║ 0   │ 00000000000000010 │ -

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes initialization of metadata table partitions upon failure:\r\n- In `BaseHoodieTableServiceClient.rollbackFailedWrites`, the fix avoids bootstrap rollback logic for MDT as MDT is never a bootstrap table and such logic can be accidentally triggered, since the MDT initial commits, e.g., `00000000000000010`, `00000000000000011`, are smaller than `FULL_BOOTSTRAP_INSTANT_TS` (`00000000000002`).\r\n- In `HoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter.initializeIfNeeded`, when async metadata indexing is disabled, if a partition is inflight, it means that the partition is not fully initialized, so the initialization should be triggered again.\r\n\r\nA new test is added based on the following scenario.  Before the fix, the test fails.\r\n\r\nThis scenario fails before the fix: When both files and record_index partitions are enabled, for the first commit in the data table, the transaction fails when initializing the second partition in the MDT.  In this case, the timelines look like below.  In this case, when restarting the pipeline, the rollback triggers irrelevant bootstrap rollback logic causing MDT to be corrupted, not properly re-initializing the record_index partition.\r\n\r\nDT\r\n```\r\n<commit_time>.commit.requested\r\n<commit_time>.commit.inflight\r\n```\r\nMDT\r\n```\r\n00000000000000010.deltacommit.requested\r\n00000000000000010.deltacommit.inflight\r\n00000000000000010.deltacommit\r\n00000000000000011.deltacommit.requested\r\n00000000000000011.deltacommit.inflight\r\n```\r\nAfterwards, `00000000000000010` is rolled back and bootstrap rollback logic adding restore kicks in, which are unexpected.\r\n```\r\n╔═════╤══════════════════════╤═══════════════════╤═══════════╤════════════════╤════════════════╤════════════════╤═════════════╤═══════════╤════════════════╤════════════════╤════════════════╗\r\n║

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe current `getCleanInstantsToArchive` filters clean and rollback instants according to maxInstantsToKeep and minInstantsToKeep respectively. There are two disadvantages: \r\n\r\n1. If user has only a few rollback instants (not satisfied with the archive), then they will exist forever, even if the commit instant has become very large, which can be very confusing for users.\r\n\r\neg:\r\n```java\r\n// user: what is 202101.rollback?\r\n202101.rollback, 202301.commit, 202302.commit ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Archiving clean and rollback separately will cause holes in the active timeline.\r\n\r\neg:\r\n```java\r\narchive:\r\n2.clean, 3.clean, 4.clean\r\n\r\nactive:\r\n1.commit, 5.commit ...\r\n```\r\nA continuous active timeline is our goal.\r\n\r\nTherefore, modifying the logic of `getCleanAndRollbackInstantsToArchive` as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Since the commit instants to archive is continuous, we can use the newest commit instant to archive as the\r\n// right boundary to collect the clean or rollback instants to archive.\r\n//\r\n//                                                  newestCommitInstantToArchive\r\n//                                                               v\r\n//  | commit1 clean1 commit2 commit3 clean2 commit4 rollback1 commit5 | commit6 clean3 commit7 ...\r\n//  | <------------------  instants to archive  --------------------> |\r\n//\r\n//  CommitInstantsToArchive: commit1, commit2, commit3, commit4, commit5\r\n//  CleanAndRollbackInstantsToArchive: clean1, clean2, rollback1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- modifying the logic of `getCleanAndRollbackInstantsToArchive`, fix two disadvantages above\r\n- Optimize the processing of `getCommitInstantsToArchive`, divide it into two parts: 1) handle oldestInstantToRetain,  2) handle savepoint.\r\n- Fix all test cases.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-10T15:38:45Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T02:28:54Z","closed_at":"2023-09-16T23:44:09Z","merged_at":"2023-09-16T23:44:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"7863348c52656788c68613dcd403659436347b75","assignee":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4143070069,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM728jt1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/table-service","name":"table-service","color":"02E2C6","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5693784631,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABU2BCNw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/release-0.15.0","name":"release-0.15.0","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9416/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9416/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/9416/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/1d98932cc66dadcdd5a544c699ad4f119c1af756","head":{"label":"Zouxxyy:dev/6678","ref":"dev/6678","sha":"1d98932cc66dadcdd5a544c699ad4f119c1af756","user":{"login":"Zouxxyy","id":37108074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTA4MDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37108074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy","html_url":"https://github.com/Zouxxyy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":520038815,"node_id":"R_kgDOHv8pnw","name":"hudi","full_name":"Zouxxyy/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Zouxxyy","id":37108074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTA4MDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37108074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy","html_url":"https://github.com/Zouxxyy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zouxxyy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","sit

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the rollback information from the metadata table to the output of the timeline commands in Hudi CLI, given that metadata data table also encounters more rollbacks now.  To make the table concise, the rollback information is added to the \"Action\" (for data table) or \"MT Action\" (for metadata table) column, instead of having an independent column showing the information.\r\n\r\nHere's the new output:\r\n```\r\nhudi:hoodie_table->timeline show active --limit 200 --show-time-seconds

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the timeline check in metadata table validator.\r\n\r\nMetadata table validator (`HoodieMetadataTableValidator`) throws the following exception before this fix when there is a completed rollback and no completed commits in the data table, and there is no completed instant in the MDT.  In this case, both the data table and MDT are empty, but the timeline check has a bug causing the validation to fail, which is a false positive.\r\n\r\n```\r\n23/08/08 22:48:13 WARN

Added a unti test to check two syncs can run concurrently if it's different base paths.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMeta sync wouldn't block for multi table deltastreamer.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-05T15:40:57Z","updated_at":"2023-08-06T06:04:47Z","closed_at":"2023-08-06T06:04:47Z","merged_at":"2023-08-06T06:04:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"cecd79e947b3a274a26e72a1f9c730323393f8f9","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2228366714,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjI4MzY2NzE0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/meta-sync","name":"meta-sync","color":"87C7C5","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5187724363,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABNTZkSw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/release-0.14.0","name":"release-0.14.0","color":"B9BAA3","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9374/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9374/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/9374/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/ee5d3013bf73645648b344a468404dd076e80003","head":{"label":"codope:concurrent-meta-sync","ref":"concurrent-meta-sync","sha":"ee5d3013bf73645648b344a468404dd076e80003","user":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis change allows us to support creating a table from a set of initial files that were not created by Hudi. This will allow us to bootstrap tables from an existing set of files instead of requiring users to rewrite tables with filenames in a format that Hudi expects (outside of the bootstrap feature)\r\n\r\nThis feature only works if metadata table is enabled.\r\n\r\nThis PR also contains some minor changes around unnecessary copying of arrays, use of LinkedList, and over use of Option when dealing with collections to reduce memory overhead.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis introduces more complexity when parsing a file status into a HoodieBaseFile but allows for more flexibility when initializing a Hudi table and unlocks ability to do a zero-copy-bootstrap of an existing set of files.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-04T17:55:10Z","updated_at":"2023-08-07T15:49:56Z","closed_at":"2023-08-07T15:49:56Z","merged_at":"2023-08-07T15:49:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"83f8874f7c1a647fa43acdbed54579f87d6e9b3c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5187724363,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABNTZkSw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/release-0.14.0","name":"release-0.14.0","color":"B9BAA3","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9367/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9367/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/9367/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/e148cb4523236708375663045f67665f028e6b50","head":{"label":"the-other-tim-brown:HUDI-6648","ref":"HUDI-6648","sha":"e148cb4523236708375663045f67665f028e6b50","user":{"login":"the-other-tim-brown","id":1360517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA1MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1360517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown","html_url":"https://github.com/the-other-tim-brown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":514061598,"node_id":"R_kgDOHqP1Hg","name":"hudi","full_name":"the-other-tim-brown/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"the-other-tim-brown","id":1360517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA1MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1360517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown","html_url":"https://github.com/the-other-tim-brown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/the-other-tim-brown/hudi","description":"Upserts,

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently MOR snapshot relation does not use the column stats index for pruning the files in its queries. This PR aims to add support for pruning the file slices based on column stats in case of MOR.\r\n\r\nThe approach is similar to what was used for `org.apache.hudi.HoodieFileIndex#listFiles`. For every partition path, logic for filtering the file slices has been moved to function `org.apache.hudi.HoodieFileIndex#filterFileSlices`.  This function is called by various relations for pruning the file slices.\r\n\r\n1. Firstly, as usual, partitions are pruned based on partition filters in `HoodieFileIndex#getFileSlicesForPrunedPartitions`.\r\n2. Next, data filters are used to employ record index or colstats on top of pruned partitions and file slices in `HoodieFileIndex#filterFileSlices`.\r\n      a. If there is an only equality predicate on record key, use record index if it is available.\r\n      b. Further, if there are range filters and column stats is available for those columns, then skip some data get the candidate file names.\r\n      c. Now, based on these candidate files (which is a **set of base and log files**), filter the file slices obtained in step 1.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe snapshot query on Merge On Read tables would improve after the PR if column stats index is enabled and if it is able to prune file slices based on the query.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium. Added more SQL related tests for column stats integration.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-02T16:12:10Z","updated_at":"2024-09-24T00:41:55Z","closed_at":"2023-08-06T16:46:30Z","merged_at":"2023-08-06T16:46:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"17279589c1678a750b09b5e29cda7ce57178d57b","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2950870088,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTUwODcwMDg4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/index","name":"index","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5187724363,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABNTZkSw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/release-0.14.0","name":"release-0.14.0","color":"B9BAA3","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9345/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9345/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/9345/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/164a6921c7d75f10ef927760db1afaa6a760a750","head":{"label":"lokeshj1703:mor_columnstat","ref":"mor_columnstat","sha":"164a6921c7d75f10ef927760db1afaa6a760a750","user":{"login":"lokeshj1703","id":9255455,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNTU0NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9255455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshj1703","html_url":"https://github.com/lokeshj1703","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshj1703/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshj1703/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshj1703/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshj1703/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshj1703/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshj1703/orgs","repos_url":"

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Updates sections of the code to use the getters in the HoodieBaseFile and HoodieLogFile instead of FSUtils to move away from relying directly on the path for getting metadata about the file when possible\r\n- Sets file ID and commit time in HoodieBaseFile on construction and avoids running `split` on the file name twice to improve efficiency\r\n- Sets fileId, baseCommitTime, logVersion, logWriteToken, fileExtension, suffix, and path when creating HoodieLogFile instead of making multiple calls to a regex based matcher to improve efficiency\r\n- Uses CachingPath instead of Path in HoodieLogFile for improved efficiency\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nLowers overhead when extracting metadata about HoodieBaseFiles or HoodieLogFiles\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow, unit tests were added to assert behavior is maintained \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

jobs\r\n- Checkpoint format => \"commitTime#Key\", sorted order of these columns will help resume ingestion\r\n- Added a few timeline apis to support fetching commit data from current

introducing batching within commits there is a risk of data loss in case we are not accurate in moving to the next batch\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn PR #9001 `JsonUtils.java` was modified to explicitly register JavaTimeModule into Json `ObjectMapper` class.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the format of delete log blocks and upgrades the log block version from 2 to 3.  After this PR, the delete records (record key, partition path, and ordering value) are serialized in Avro and then written into the delete log block, instead of using Kyro which is a serialization framework for Java.  This makes delete blocks deserializable in programming languages other than Java, as Avro is supported by common programming languages such as [Java](https://github.com/apache/avro/tree/master/lang/java), [C/C++](https://github.com/apache/avro/tree/master/lang/c), [Python](https://github.com/apache/avro/tree/master/lang/py), and [Rust](https://github.com/apache/avro/tree/master/lang/rust).\r\n\r\nChanges are:\r\n- New avro schema for delete record: `HoodieDeleteRecordList` and `HoodieDeleteRecord`, reusing avro type wrappers used by column stats in metadata;\r\n- Moves avro type wrappers and util methods to `HoodieAvroUtils` for reuse;\r\n- Upgrades log block version from version 2 to 3;\r\n- Changes the logic in `HoodieDeleteBlock` to serialize delete records using Avro and deserialize v3 content using Avro.  Deserialization of v2 content still uses Kryo to be backwards compatible;\r\n- Adds unit tests of Avro serde of the delete block in `TestHoodieDeleteBlock`, Avro (un)wrapping utils in `TestHoodieAvroUtils`, and writing both V2 and V3 delete blocks in the same file group and scanning the logs using `HoodieMergedLogRecordScanner` in `TestHoodieLogFormat#testLogReaderWithDifferentVersionsOfDeleteBlocks`.\r\n\r\nThe following shows the benchmark result comparing the serde of Avro (v3) vs Kryo (v2) for a delete block with varying number of deletes, with Avro 1.11.1.  Record key is UUID string, partition path is date string (e.g., \"2023-01-01\"), and the ordering value is long value.  Avro serde is moderately slower than Kryo, except for serializing 100k+ entries.  The difference is only at 100-millisecond level at most for 1 million entries.  The bytes generated by Avro are 10% to 20% larger than that by Kryo.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  @Benchmark\r\n  public void serializeDeleteRecords(BenchState bs, Blackhole bh) throws IOException {\r\n    HoodieDeleteBlock deleteBlock = new HoodieDeleteBlock(bs.deleteRecordArray, new HashMap<>());\r\n    deleteBlock.getContentBytes();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Benchmark\r\n  public void deserializeDeleteRecords(BenchState bs, Blackhole bh) throws IOException {\r\n    HoodieDeleteBlock deleteBlock = new HoodieDeleteBlock(\r\n        Option.of(bs.deleteContentBytes), null, true, Option.empty(), new HashMap<>(), new HashMap<>());\r\n    deleteBlock.getRecordsToDelete();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n```\r\n# JMH version: 1.28\r\n# VM version: JDK 1.8.0_292, OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM,

Change Logs\r\n\r\nString.format is used in the implementation of the current toHexString method. In the case of a large number of cases, the performance is low, and there will be frequent memory copies, which will lead to an increase in GC frequency and further increase in CPU utilization. \r\n\r\nFor production tasks, the spark driver process may be killed because the CPU usage threshold is exceeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nIt will reduce GC frequency, reduce cpu usage, and improve efficiency\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\nhigh\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nEnhancing RLI schema with MDT to support for different fileID formats. We can store UUID based format or any other format as well. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nRLI can support storing fileId of any formats. \r\n1. UUID based one which can be reconstructed using high order bits, low order bits and fileIndex. \r\n2. raw string format stored using field \"fileId\". \r\n\r\nChanges in schema:\r\n1. we are adding a field called \"fileIdEncoding\" to denote the fileId format. default value of 0 represents UUID based fileID, while 1 represents raw string format. \r\n2. Added a field named \"fileId\" which could store raw fileID in string format. \r\n3. Fixed \"partition\" field naming to \"partitionName\"\r\n4. Made all columns nullable. \r\n5. Added proper docs to every field in RLI\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n-

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Merge Into prepped path optimization by adding broadcast `JoinHint`. Ideally, we would want to expose this as a config, as the right join type really depends on the left and right dataframes of the join. \r\n- Revert #8452 as it adds another stage. Need to optimize partition path prefix filtering.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproved MIT queries. However, some partition filter pushdown may not work due to revert.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the
