I've set the default to `10000` in accordance with the default FlowFile queue backpressure object count.\r\n\r\nIf more than the configured value of split FlowFiles are needed, the original FlowFile is pushed back to the upstream queue with status information on already processed records added in attributes. This allows splitting large record sets into single or few records per FlowFile iteratively while using standard back pressure mechanisms to limit the count of FlowFiles in the Flow at once. \r\n\r\nWhile \"flushing in-flight sessions with lots of flowfile references to disk\" as suggested in a comment on the Jira issue would address the memory problem as well, it would still result in lots of FlowFiles in the downstream queue which users might not desire.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

changing the startup logic in two ways. First, we enable Controller Services before we create the Stateless Flow. Secondly, we do not bother enabling the ephemeral Controller Services that are created during the Stateless Flow creation/synchronization. This ensures that if Processors make use of a Controller Service during its @OnScheduled method (which is part of the Stateless Flow initialization process) that the Controller Service is Enabled. It also avoids calling @OnEnabled methods of Controller Services that will never actually be used, as Processors make use of the existing Controller Services when running within standard NiFi\r\n\r\n<!-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more -->\r\n<!-- contributor license agreements.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13770](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13770) Removes the `python.` placeholder prefix from Python Processors added when loading extensions, and corrects the user interface behavior to display the component type.\r\n\r\nThe original implementation of support for Python Processors included the prefix as a workaround for UI rendering that expected a package name along with the simple class name. The updated UI function handles simple names for Python Processors as well as standard Java classes.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

install task for an uploaded NAR will correctly set the state to FAILED if one of the extensions from the NAR produces an Error when attempting to access the Class.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it improves the handling of doc generation so that we don't fail start up if an Error is encountered when trying to document the component, as well as no longer failing to retrieve the available component types when one component's class produces an Error.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

This causes all tests to pass and uses the intended inferred schema.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [ ] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [ ] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [ ] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [ ] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [ ] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nRan NonDex 10 times.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13718](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13718) Refactors Cluster Request Replication from the OkHttp library implementation to using the `nifi-web-client-api` and the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13706](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13706) Updates the flow synchronization process to catch exceptions when fetching Parameters from Parameter Providers.\r\n\r\nThe framework logs a warning when catching exceptions from a Parameter Provider, and already handles logging warnings when a Parameter Provider does not return values for a configured Parameter.\r\n\r\nThis change in the startup process allows NiFi to start even when a Parameter Provider has configuration or connectivity issues. Missing Parameter values may result in flow configuration problems, which an authorized user can correct after fixing the referenced Parameter Provider.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13688](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13688) Initiates validation on Parameter Providers before calling `fetchParameters` to avoid validation status errors for Providers that do not have Controller Service dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe initial changes for [NIFI-13688](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13688) resolved issues for Parameter Providers with Controller Services because enabling Controller-level Services also performs validation on referencing components. The current set of changes preserves that behavior and also initiates validation directly on Parameter Provider to handle all implementations, regardless of dependencies.\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13689](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13689) Adds a watch delay of 60 seconds to the NiFi Bootstrap Start Command to avoid launching the monitoring command when the application process fails on initial launch. This approach is similar to the previous implementation that waited up to 60 seconds for a successful launch. The implementation expects that application configuration problems will cause the application launch failures before the watch delay expires.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13688](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13688) Resolves a problem where Parameter Providers can fail to fetch parameters on startup due to referenced Controller Services not being enabled.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is the result of Management Controller Services not being enabled before the application calls `ParameterProvider.fetchParameters()`. The application validates standard Controller Services later in the flow loading process, but the application enables Management Controller Services earlier. After enabling Management Controller Services, performing validation on those Services allows valid Controller Services to become enabled.\r\n\r\nThe addition of a validation status check without timeout for fetching parameters gives an interval of time to wait for enabling. Parameter Providers that are not valid will result in a warning message, but the application will start so that administrators can diagnose configuration problems.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease
