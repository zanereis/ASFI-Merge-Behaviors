a follower's fetch offset is behind the leader's log start offset, the follower will do a full log truncation. When it does so, it must update both its log start offset and high watermark. The previous code did the former, but not the latter. Failure to update the high watermark in this case can lead to out of range errors if the follower becomes leader before getting the latest high watermark from the previous leader. The out of range errors occur when we attempt to resolve the log position of the high watermark in `DelayedFetch` in order to determine if a fetch is satisfied.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

this change?\r\nTo enable better validation. Including the data type can significantly improve client's(web or cli or any other client) ability to validate the values before even making a request to Kafka. In the absence of `type` the only way to know if the user specified value is correct is to make an `alter` call and check if there is no error.\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix. Unit and/or integration\r\ntests are expected for any behaviour change and\r\nsystem tests should be considered for larger changes.*\r\n\r\nUpdated and added new unit tests\r\n\r\n### Committer

feature corresponds to KIP-558 and extends how the status.storage.topic is used to include information that allows Kafka Connect to keep track which topics a connector is using. \r\n\r\nThe set of topics a connector is actively using, is exposed via a new endpoint that is added to the REST API of Connect workers.\r\n* A GET /connectors/{name}/topics request will return the set of topics that have been recorded as active since a connector started or since the set of topics was reset for this connector. \r\n\r\nAn additional endpoints allows users to reset the set of active topics for a connector via the second endpoint that this feature is adding: \r\n* A PUT /connectors/{name}/topics/reset request clears the set of active topics. \r\n\r\nAn operator may enable or disable this feature by setting: \r\ntopic.tracking.enable (true by default). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, an operator may disable only reset requests via the Connect REST API by setting: \r\ntopic.tracking.allow.reset to false (true by default). \r\n\r\nIn the current commit the code for KIP-558 is feature complete.\r\n\r\nIt's tested by extending the current unit tests. Because changes are required in the integration testing framework itself in order to add integration testing for topic tracking (KIP-558), these tests will be submitted in a follow up pull request. Same, for Connect system tests that will extend coverage beyond integration testing. System tests will be added in a separate pull request, if additional coverage is required beyond integration testing. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-29T03:29:11Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T05:51:00Z","closed_at":"2020-01-30T05:54:22Z","merged_at":"2020-01-30T05:54:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"7746301c2643e0037bff3bcb84c41d512937e4c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8017/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8017/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8017/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/7328b172193c7c52d38fe24553e50c846e18319e","head":{"label":"kkonstantine:kafka-9422","ref":"kafka-9422","sha":"7328b172193c7c52d38fe24553e50c846e18319e","user":{"login":"kkonstantine","id":16238634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjM4NjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16238634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine","html_url":"https://github.com/kkonstantine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66110287,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjExMDI4Nw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"kkonstantine/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kkonstantine","id":16238634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjM4NjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16238634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine","html_url":"https://github.com/kkonstantine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kkonstantine/kafka","description":"Mirror

change mainly have 2 components:\r\n\r\n1. extend the existing `transactions_test.py` to also try out new `sendTxnOffsets(groupMetadata)` API to make sure we are not introducing any regression or compatibility issue\r\n  a. We shrink the time window to 10 seconds for the txn timeout scheduler on broker so that we could trigger expiration earlier than later\r\n2. create a completely new system test class called `group_mode_transactions_test` which is more complicated than the existing system test, as we are taking rebalance into consideration and using multiple partitions instead of one. For further breakdown:\r\n  a. The message count was done on partition level, instead of global as we need to visualize the per partition order throughout the test. For this sake, we extend ConsoleConsumer to print out the data partition as well to help message copier interpret the per partition data.\r\n  b. The progress count includes the time for completing the pending txn offset expiration\r\n  c.

PR is collaborated by Guozhang Wang and John Roesler. It is a significant tech debt cleanup on task management and state management, and is broken down by several sub-tasks listed below:\r\n\r\n1. Extract embedded clients (producer and consumer) into RecordCollector from StreamTask.\r\nhttps://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka/pull/2\r\nhttps://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka/pull/5\r\n\r\n2. Consolidate the standby updating and active restoring logic into ChangelogReader and extract out of StreamThread.\r\nhttps://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka/pull/3\r\nhttps://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka/pull/4\r\n\r\n3. Introduce Task state life cycle (created, restoring, running, suspended, closing), and refactor the task operations based on the current state.\r\nhttps://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka/pull/6\r\nhttps://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka/pull/7\r\n\r\n4. Consolidate AssignedTasks into TaskManager and simplify the logic of changelog management and task management (since they are already moved in step 2) and 3)).\r\nhttps://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka/pull/8\r\nhttps://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka/pull/9\r\n\r\nAlso simplified the StreamThread logic a bit as the embedded clients / changelog restoration logic has been moved into step 1) and 2).\r\nhttps://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka/pull/10\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-22T05:46:31Z","updated_at":"2020-04-24T23:59:58Z","closed_at":"2020-02-05T05:06:40Z","merged_at":"2020-02-05T05:06:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"4090f9a2b0a95e4da127e4786007542276d97520","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7997/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7997/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7997/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/196e7c0210b659ec81335d5624ae0cf5127fdf21","head":{"label":"guozhangwang:k9113-base","ref":"k9113-base","sha":"196e7c0210b659ec81335d5624ae0cf5127fdf21","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39164613,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTE2NDYxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"guozhangwang/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka","description":"Mirror

a reassignment, it can happen that the current leader of a partition is demoted and removed from the replica set at the same time. In this case, we rely on the StopReplica request in order to stop replica fetchers and to clear the group coordinator cache. This patch adds similar logic to ensure that the transaction coordinator state cache also gets cleared.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

title suggests, the change is bringing in the consumer group metadata as part of the transaction API for correct fencing after 447.\r\nThis PR mainly changes on the Producer end for compatible paths to old `sendOffsetsToTxn(offsets, groupId)` vs new `sendOffsetsToTxn(offsets, groupMetadata)`.\r\n\r\nSome integration test extensions are also added to test out the validity of the new sendOffsets API.\r\n\r\nThis PR also contains some fixes towards the closed protocol PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

`CircularIterator` class uses a wrapping index-based approach to iterate over a list.  This can be a performance problem O(n^2) for a LinkedList.  Also, the index counter itself is never reset, a modulo is applied to it for every list access.  At some point, it may be possible that the index counter overflows to a negative value and therefore may cause a negative index read and an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.\r\n\r\nI propose changing this implementation to avoid these two scenarios.  Use the `Collection` `Iterator` classes to avoid using an index counter and it avoids having to seek to the correct index every time, this avoiding the LinkedList performance issue.\r\n\r\nI have added unit tests to validate the new implementation.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build
