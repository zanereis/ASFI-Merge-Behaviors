the flexible trigger form and also DAG run notes evolved on other screens, this is a small cleanup and UI polishing:\r\n- Align labels and etry firlds on the advanced part with other fields in Flexible Trigger Form (Two columns, label left, entry box right==horizontal\r\n- Use the same note preview with markdown like the other Task Instance Note / Dag Run Note fields evolved in parallel\r\n- Unfortunately the linter raised the problem that file-too-long so I needed to extract a TS component out of the file which made the PR larger than I wanted to.

noticed that the flexible trigger form always used minimum 80px as space per form row, even if content is less.

PR improves SFTP hook's `store_directory` and `retrieve_directory` functions to use a single connection when transferring a directory with multiple files.\r\n\r\nPreviously, these functions relied on `store_file` and `retrieve_file` functions. And with this [PR](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/44247), the `store_file` and `retrieve_file` functions were modified to open and close sftp connection each time.\r\nThis leads to the `store_directory` and `retrieve_directory` functions to open and close too many connections repeatedly when there are many files in a directory, which causes significant overhead.\r\n\r\nTo address this, I modified them to open a connection, transfer all files in a directory, and then close the connection afterward.\r\n\r\nI also did a performance test in my local environment by transferring a directory containing 1,000 small files. This reduced the transfer time by approximately 8-9 seconds. The results are shown below.\r\n\r\n|        | AS-IS     | TO-BE     |\r\n|--------|-----------|-----------|\r\n| store  | 47.18 sec | 39.35 sec |\r\n| retrieve | 63.50 sec | 54.73 sec

Moves top level import from Google's OpenLineage utils into operator's execute method, to avoid issues with ImportError, should they happen in the future.\r\n2. Adds try/except for OpenLineage code in DataProc operators, so that any error related to OpenLineage does not affect execution of DataProc.\r\n3. Moves `BigQueryJobRunFacet` to a separate file and add try/except on class definition, in case OpenLineage is not available (similar logic as in common.compat provider). I've also moved the import of this facet into specific method in _OpenLineageMixin, so it's no longer top level import.\r\n\r\nI've tested it manually on the environment without OpenLineage and the error described in the issue is gone after applying  changes included in this PR.\r\n\r\nCC @mobuchowski \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

Effectively, it splits `DagFileInfo` into 2 entities:\r\n  - `DagEntrypoint` - where DAG(s) file is referenced without a tie to any version (and path where it is actually present as a file)\r\n  - `ParseFileInfo` - where DAG(s) file is parsed within a fixed parse context - here we guarantee that the file has some absolute path attached to it and can be read.\r\n\r\nThis separation of types delegates the pain of figuring out of \"do I have an absolute path set here?\" to static type checks and revealed a couple of bugs in tests.\r\nWith this implemented, the migration of DAG code and import errors becomes straight forward and removes the need to pass multiple additional parameters across multiple methods in `dag_processing/collection.py` of model. Otherwise we would have to drag bundle's name, path and version as arguments across multiple functions (or do an even more disruptive refactoring, which wouldn't align with feature-freeze goals at all).\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

auth manager is currently used in AF2 web application (Flask) and AF3 web application (fastapi). One of the responsibility of the auth manager is to provide the url of the login page. This URL differs whether we are in the context of AF2 or AF3. To address both use cases, I introduce an ugly flag to specify whether the auth manager is run in AF2 or AF3. This is temporary and will be removed when the AF2 Flask application is removed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Overview\r\nHi Airflow community,\r\n\r\nI´m currently trying to get Airflow metrics exported via OTEL -> Prometheus into Grafana Dashboards. I wanted to use the label advantage of OTEL to create nice Dashboards. \r\n\r\nDuring the implementation I found an issue and will use metric airflow_dag_processing_last_duration to explain the details:\r\n\r\nThis metric is exported in 2 different ways in the Airflow code, to support statsd way and otel way with labels.\r\nStats.timing(f\"dag_processing.last_duration.{file_name}\", stat.last_duration)\r\nStats.timing(\"dag_processing.last_duration\", stat.last_duration, tags={\"file_name\": file_name})\r\n\r\nThe following prometheus example contains metric export for 2 dags (dag1, dag2). But the metric with the label (Otel) does only export the metric for 1 dag. Metric export with file_name in the metric name is exported for 2 dags.\r\n\r\n| # HELP airflow_dag_processing_last_duration\r\n| # TYPE airflow_dag_processing_last_duration gauge\r\n| airflow_dag_processing_last_duration{file_name=\"dag1\",job=\"Airflow\"} 0.293856\r\n\r\n| # HELP airflow_dag_processing_last_duration_dag1\r\n| # TYPE airflow_dag_processing_last_duration_dag1  gauge\r\n| airflow_dag_processing_last_duration_dag1 {job=\"Airflow\"} 0.293856\r\n| # HELP airflow_dag_processing_last_duration_blabla2\r\n| # TYPE airflow_dag_processing_last_duration_blabla2 gauge\r\n| airflow_dag_processing_last_duration_dag2{job=\"Airflow\"} 0.343803\r\n\r\nwould expect that the metric is also exported like this:\r\n| airflow_dag_processing_last_duration{file_name=\"dag2\",job=\"Airflow\"} 0.343803\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I debugged some time and found out that this issue is only related to the gauge export. If the metric is a counter the label export works fine.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the gauge value is created as an ObserveableGauge and with that OTEL uses a callback to collect the metric. For this OTEL python lib creates intruments to handle the metric. The down side of this is that if a second Observable instrument with the same metric name is created, OTEL will only create one instrument because it checks for the metric name. \r\nThis results in the issue that only the callback for the first registered metric will be executed and all other metrics with different label but same name will be ignored.\r\nMy idea is now to switch to an syncronos gauge export of the metric like it is used for the counter export. \r\n\r\nI´m not sure why the ObserveableGauge was used but I did not found a solution to fix the issue without switching to sync gauge export.\r\nAlso not sure about any down side of using sync gauge, like maybe runtime, but for the counter metric export sync was also used. Anyone has more know how in that area and give feedback for this?\r\n\r\n# Details of changes:\r\n* Use of normal sync Gauge instead of ObservedGauge.\r\n* Moved logic to handle gauge into InternalGauge class.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to fix this issue and the feedback from your

uses the API to get recent 14 dag runs to plot the chart along with average of the run and queued duration as annotations. The size is 1/3 since there will be 2 more for success/failed rate and grouped durations as per design. This is for initial implementation and might not completely cover all use cases like Airflow 2 but can be taken up in subsequent PRs or separate issues for them as below. If approved a similar overview page can be created for task page as well in another PR for task duration.\r\n\r\nNotes to self and review \r\n\r\n1. It seems `stateColor.ts` was removed. What is the recommended way to show color based on state for a given theme?\r\n2. Legend is not implemented now where in Airflow 2 it can be selected to show only those values.\r\n3. Duration is now in seconds and conversion to other units is yet to be implemented.\r\n4. x axis value is set to 3 since high number causes values to render vertically amidst smaller space.\r\n5. landing times based toggle is not implemented yet.\r\n6. Clicking on dagrun to take to the run page is not implemented yet.\r\n7. Autorefresh is not yet implemented.\r\n8. It seems even with limit of 14 passed more dagruns are returned. Changing it manually reflects correct value. Need to see if there is some cache issue.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/762a97ba-e168-4adb-9159-a164ca99876e)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08ee9784-a120-4954-812c-5616c2b38102)\r\n","created_at":"2025-02-06T08:10:16Z","updated_at":"2025-02-07T19:59:05Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bde929f6cad62021e5020f19bfbb87bd94984136","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jscheffl","id":95105677,"node_id":"U_kgDOBasyjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95105677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl","html_url":"https://github.com/jscheffl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

tests pass but there are many issues (after fixing a handful of failures related to paths being used in tests which needed updating):\r\n\r\n### 1) mypy failures:\r\nExample: \r\n```traceback\r\nproviders/amazon/src/airflow/providers/amazon/aws/operators/bedrock.py:358: error:\r\nValue of type \"Optional[dict[str, Any]]\" is not indexable  [index]\r\n            if event[\"status\"] != \"success\":\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have a helper `validate_execute_complete_event(event)` to check if the event is None, for this exact reason. Which was working perfectly fine before the migration but is now failing type checking locally for me on all operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2) docs\r\n\r\nThere are many _api docs which either seem out of date or have spelling errors that seem to already be fixed. I do not know how to generate these docs. I tried a docs build but that fails because all paths to system test examples are now incorrect. I'm not sure if this is something unique to amazon, or if the migration script failed (there were some issues related to the `aws` directory within the `amazon` provider).\r\n\r\n### 3) there are many bits of code that have not been static checked for issues of spelling and words like \"master\". I've fixed most but some are in places that are difficult to change.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

CreateVirtualCluster operation: Cluster XXX is not reachable as its connection is currently being updated\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error happens when trying to create the virtual cluster on EMR. The creation of this virtual cluster happens after creating the EKS cluster and waiting for its status to be active.  After some testing, the creation succeeds after waiting few seconds between the creation of the EKS cluster and the virtual cluster. It must be a race condition. Retrying is the only option here since there is no notion of cluster connection status in EKS.\r\n\r\nI also revert the change I did in #46441 because it did not help (it just happened to succeed when I changed the version, but it was a fluke ...).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Ref: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-connect#choosing-fail-open-or-fail-close-mode\r\n\r\nThe `ocsp_fail_open` parameter defaults to `True` inside of the driver when the snowflake-connector version is 1.8.0 or later. So the usual case for overriding the setting will be providing a `False` value. That is different than other flags (where we only pass through `True`), so you may notice some difference in the flag handling.\r\n\r\nAlso, for building the sqlalchemy engine, this parameter needs to be passed in as part of `connect_args`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/45966\r\n\r\nDebugging Airflow workflows often involves dealing with incorrect or missing XCom values, which can cause tasks to fail or behave unexpectedly. \r\nTraditionally, fixing such issues requires rerunning tasks, modifying Dag logic, or even manually editing the Airflow metadata database—none of which are ideal in a production setting. With API-based XCom updates, users can quickly correct erroneous values without restarting entire workflows. \r\nThis is especially useful in long-running jobs, where reprocessing can be costly, or in dependency-heavy pipelines, where a single incorrect value can block multiple downstream tasks. By allowing targeted updates, this feature speeds up debugging, reduces downtime, and ensures smoother workflow execution.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Steps to play around the feature.\r\n\r\nAdd the following Dag.\r\n```\r\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator\r\nimport time\r\n\r\ndef push_xcom_value(ti):\r\n    value_to_push = \"Hello from XCom!\"\r\n    ti.xcom_push(key='my_key', value=value_to_push)\r\n    time.sleep(60)  # Wait for 1 minute, meanwhile you can update the XCom via API\r\n\r\ndef pull_xcom_value(ti):\r\n    pulled_value = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='push_task', key='my_key')\r\n    print(f\"Pulled Value: {pulled_value}\") # Updated value should be present\r\n\r\ndefault_args = {\r\n    'owner': 'airflow',\r\n    'catchup': False,\r\n    'start_date': datetime(2024, 2, 5),\r\n}\r\n\r\ndag = DAG(\r\n    'xcom_push_pull_dag',\r\n    default_args=default_args,\r\n    description='A simple DAG to demonstrate XCom push and pull',\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n)\r\n\r\npush_task = PythonOperator(\r\n    task_id='push_task',\r\n    python_callable=push_xcom_value,\r\n    dag=dag,\r\n)\r\n\r\npull_task = PythonOperator(\r\n    task_id='pull_task',\r\n    python_callable=pull_xcom_value,\r\n    dag=dag,\r\n)\r\n\r\npush_task >> pull_task\r\n\r\n```\r\nAs soon as push_task has pushed to xcom, just update the value via API.\r\nhttp://localhost:29091/docs#/XCom/update_xcom_entry\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1416\" alt=\"image\"
