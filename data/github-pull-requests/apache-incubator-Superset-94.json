SUMMARY\r\nWe saw some fatal errors for dashboards based on druid datasources in the `/dashboard/<id>/datasets` API. The root cause seems to be [this change](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15188/files#diff-f7dd033ada4e47e82f1341b9d7d77c7f0b980bd3c21d54b6e0b4c7e5ad30f3c4L312), which fails for druid datasources because `type_generic` is not defined on the columns. I'm not sure whether this property should be added to druid columns, so just to be safe, I switched to using `.get()` so that the datasets API would not fail if `type_generic` was not defined.\r\n\r\nThe error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<console>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/srv/superset-internal/superset-fork/superset/dashboards/dao.py\",

SUMMARY\r\nWhen new sequential color scheme is added to the `EXTRA_SEQUENTIAL_COLOR_SCHEMES` variable in `config.py` it does not appear in the list of linear color schemes. Instead it can be found in the list of categorical color schemes.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Add\r\n```EXTRA_SEQUENTIAL_COLOR_SCHEMES = [\r\n{\r\n    \"id\": \"GnYlRd\",\r\n    \"label\": \"green/yellow/red\",\r\n    \"colors\": ['#006837','#1a9850','#66bd63','#a6d96a','#d9ef8b','#fee08b','#fdae61','#f46d43','#d73027','#a50026'],\r\n    \"isDiverging\": True,\r\n    \"description\": \"\",\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\nto the config.py file.\r\n2. Once the superset_app container reloads, open any visualization that uses sequential schemes.\r\n3. Click color scheme dropdown and ensure that green/yellow/red color scheme present.\r\n4. Open any visualization that uses categorical schemes.\r\n5. Click on the color scheme dropdown, green/yellow/red scheme should not be there.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis is a PR into the _feature branch_ for a new viz picker modal design.\r\n\r\nAdding categories in the form of tabs - the tab styles were borrowed and somewhat modified from the dashboard native filter modal's tabs. I wanted to make a shared component for both of them to use but didn't settle on the right set of functionality since the native filters modal requires so much extra behavior.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\nWhen new native filter was created, \"Apply to all panels\" scope was always selected by default. In the case of dashboards that have charts built on multiple datasets (e.g. `Slack Dashboard` from test data), filter that uses given dataset usually is incompatible and does not have any effect on charts that use a different dataset. This PR implements \"smarter\" selection of default scope - when user created a new filter, charts that use different dataset than the filter will be unselected. Changing dataset updates the default scoping tree, but only if the user didn't make any changes there - if the user changes selection in the scoping tree and then changes dataset, we don't update the tree automatically.\r\nThe feature takes effect only on new filters. Once a filter is saved, we don't apply default selection to the scopong tree upon editing the filter and its dataset.\r\nNext to \"incompatible\" charts I added an icon with a tooltip that explains why those charts were not selected by default. I used `Info` icon for that purpose. Other icons that I considered were `Alert` and `Warning` , but since potentially a lot of those icons can appear next to each other, I didn't want to use something too \"aggressive\". I'd greatly appreciate design input/approval!

Enable `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` feature flag\r\n1. Create a dashboard with charts that use the same dataset.\r\n2. Create a native filter and verify that \"Apply to all panels\" scope is selected by default\r\n3. Create a dashboard with charts that use multiple datasets\r\n4. Create a native filter, choose a dataset and verify that only the charts that use that dataset are in scope by default.\r\n5. Change dataset, verify that scope tree got updated so that charts that use the new dataset are now in scope.\r\n6. Modify the scope, change dataset and verify that the scope didn't change.\r\n7. Save the filter, edit it, change its dataset, verify that the scoe didn't change.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

SUMMARY\r\nVarious improvements to time picker and time range filter:\r\n- Defer rendering of time range filter to first visibility like other filters. This extra logic is required since the time range filter doesn't have a regular query like other filters.\r\n- Make \"Clear all\" work again.\r\n- Avoid debounced time range evaluation request if the time range is unchanged. Will remove the double request on first render and also avoid re-requesting if the time range is changed back to its original value during debounce. Improvements affect native time range filter, Explore view and Filter Box where time picker is used.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/122913068-af397980-d361-11eb-86e7-fa161dbc3010.mp4\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/122913112-ba8ca500-d361-11eb-9c62-a1a3d51b86db.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThere are scenarios that Alpha role type of user will want to import dashboards/datasets/charts and etc' and set themselves as owners upon importing.\r\nthis naive solution is a simple ready to opt-in checkbox on the import modal\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution would we to have a select dropdown of all of the users and choosing them as owners , therefore you can include yourself on the list as well . \r\nThis solution might be suitable for Admin but as a Alpha role user we should only have control on our own user and not other users\r\n\r\nthis is why I think for now we can start with a boolean only flag and later on the roadmap upgrade this feature when we'll have a multi-tenant /workspace solution that can isolate different groups of users for each other and can access objects like dashboards/charts/datasets only on their group scope.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

version.\r\n2. mark the checkbox that says \"set my user as owner\" and submit \r\n3. see that created dashboards/charts/datasets and etc' were added with your user as their owner\r\n\r\nscenario 2 \r\nsame as scenario 1 but with a different user\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR is part of the `advanced analytics`. in this PR introduces:\r\n- `run extra query` on the v1 data API\r\n- add `compare` operator for time compare\r\n- refactoring `get_df_payload`\r\n- persistent extra query results(per time offset)\r\n- unit test for these new functions\r\n- minor improvements in `Makefile`, `diff operator` and `pylint`\r\n\r\nclient-side codes at: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1170\r\n\r\n### Preparing test data\r\nplease use `random_time_series` dataset for this test.\r\n\r\n### Calculation changes (there are 3 changes)\r\nNow the time offset calculation has some changes from before. \r\n\r\n1. Extra query `where clause` offset calculation, use **time units(x years/x months/x weeks)** as calculation offset instead of **day timedelta** to calculate offsets. This will avoid leap year with incorrect calculation\r\n\r\nBefore **Main** query(line chart) \r\n```\r\nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', ds) AS __timestamp,\r\n       COUNT(*) AS count\r\nFROM random_time_series\r\nWHERE ds >= TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-03-01 00:00:00.000000', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.US')\r\n  AND ds < TO_TIMESTAMP('2017-03-01 00:00:00.000000', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.US')\r\nGROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', ds)\r\nORDER BY count DESC\r\nLIMIT 50000\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefor **1 year ago offset** query(line chart) \r\n```\r\nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', ds) AS __timestamp,\r\n       COUNT(*) AS count\r\nFROM random_time_series\r\nWHERE ds >= TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-03-02 00:00:00.000000', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.US')\r\n  AND ds < TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-03-01 00:00:00.000000', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.US')\r\nGROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', ds)\r\nORDER BY count DESC\r\nLIMIT 50000\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter **Main** query (time-series chart)\r\n```\r\nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', ds) AS __timestamp,\r\n       COUNT(*) AS count\r\nFROM random_time_series\r\nWHERE ds >= TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-03-01 00:00:00.000000', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.US')\r\n  AND ds < TO_TIMESTAMP('2017-03-01 00:00:00.000000', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.US')\r\nGROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', ds)\r\nLIMIT 50000\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter **1 year ago offset** query\r\n```\r\nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', ds) AS __timestamp,\r\n       COUNT(*) AS count\r\nFROM random_time_series\r\nWHERE ds >= TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-03-01 00:00:00.000000', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.US')\r\n  AND ds < TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-03-01 00:00:00.000000', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.US')\r\nGROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', ds)\r\nLIMIT 50000\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Use `join on __timestamp` instead of `concat` merge main dataframe and extra dataframe. This ensures that the main query and the extension query have the same time granularity calculation on metrics.\r\n\r\nConsider this scenario(time-series chart):\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-07-01 at 1 10 50 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/124069649-185e7280-da6f-11eb-9927-91b3cea5fb06.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main query is:\r\n```\r\nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', ds) AS __timestamp,\r\n       COUNT(*) AS count\r\nFROM random_time_series\r\nWHERE ds >= TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-03-01 00:00:00.000000', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.US')\r\n  AND ds < TO_TIMESTAMP('2017-03-01 00:00:00.000000', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.US')\r\nGROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', ds)\r\nLIMIT 50000\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith the time shift `28 days ago` query is:\r\n```\r\nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', ds) AS __timestamp,\r\n       COUNT(*) AS count\r\nFROM random_time_series\r\nWHERE ds >= TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-02-02 00:00:00.000000', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.US')\r\n  AND ds < TO_TIMESTAMP('2017-02-01 00:00:00.000000', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.US')\r\nGROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', ds)\r\nLIMIT 50000\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the extra query is missing the data of **2016-02-01**(the main query grain is month, but the extra query is missing a day, the metric is incorrect), when **main dataframe left join extra dataframe on __timestamp**, the extra data that is not \"align\" on the main dataframe will be removed automatically.\r\n\r\nextra query dataframe\r\n<img width=\"713\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/124073902-43e45b80-da75-11eb-9f74-d6751c319bc4.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nmerged dataframe\r\n<img width=\"734\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/124073868-34fda900-da75-11eb-890d-a6637179ce70.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the default value picker requires two clicks on the checkbox to disable the default value. Other improvements:\r\n- When \"Default to first item\" is checked, automatically uncheck and disable \"Filter has default value\".\r\n- When \"Required\" is checked, automatically check and disable \"Filter has default value\".\r\n- When \"Filter has default value\" is selected, validate that default value is selected.\r\n- Add tooltip to default value picker when it is disabled or required (either if \"Filter has default value\", \"Required\", \"Default to first item\" is selected)\r\n- When \"Required\" is unchecked and default selection is empty, automatically uncheck \"Default has default value\" (don't do anything if default selection is non-empty).\r\n- Make minimum height of child row in `CollapsibleControl` 32 px (currently 40 px).\r\n- When unchecking \"Required\" and default value is unset, automatically uncheck \"Filter has default value\" (don't uncheck if default value is defined)\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAdds type annotations to feature flags, clearly stating that all feature flags are booleans. Because of that `QUERY_COST_FORMATTERS_BY_ENGINE`, `SCHEDULED_QUERIES` and `SQL_VALIDATORS_BY_ENGINE` are no longer feature flags but config keys. Note that currently on master, `SQL_VALIDATORS_BY_ENGINE` is defined as a top level key on `config.py`, but is erroneously being read from the feature flag object on the frontend. This fixes the issue and adds a note to `UPDATING.md`.\r\n\r\n### Testing instructions\r\n1. Go to SQL Lab and open a Postgres database\r\n2. Write a query that's incorrect and verify that the error shows up in the gutter (see below)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/142435963-903d94a4-b988-4552-9f4c-a6f09657804b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n-

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nIntroduce the `dataset` macro, allowing users to query physical and virtual datasets in SQL Lab. This is useful if you've defined computed columns and metrics on your datasets, and want to reuse the definition in adhoc SQL Lab queries.\r\n\r\nBecause currently dataset names are not unique the macro uses the dataset ID:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM {{ dataset(42) }} LIMIT 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf users want to select the metric definitions as well, in addition to the columns, they can pass an additional keyword argument:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM {{ dataset(42, include_metrics=True) }} LIMIT 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince metrics are aggregations, the resulting SQL expression will be grouped by all non-metric columns. Users can also specify a subset of columns to group by instead:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM {{ dataset(42, include_metrics=True, groupby=[\"ds\", \"category\"]) }} LIMIT 10\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-06-17 at 15-12-21 Superset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/122478860-01078b80-cf7f-11eb-9e5d-ffaf71b3f6ce.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nI recently wrote a PR applying Marshmallow validation to the parameters in the `validate_parameters`

SUMMARY\r\nImproves the `Select` component UI/UX - iteration 2.\r\n\r\nStorybook changes:\r\n\r\nAt Every Corner\r\n- Adds a text explaining the objective of this panel\r\n- Increases the selects width\r\n\r\nAsync Select\r\n- Allows the user to simulate a slower connection\r\n- Displays the dispatched requests\r\n- Decreases the select width\r\n\r\nInteractive Select\r\n- Decreases the select width\r\n\r\nSelect component changes:\r\n- Fixes a bug where the paginated scroll keeps requesting data if the user scrolls down and there is no more data available\r\n- Moves `debounce` from `handleFetch` to `handleOnSearch`\r\n- Renames the select\r\n\r\nImprovements/tasks that will be done in the next iterations:\r\n\r\nAsync Select\r\n- Make it more clear that the select is loading while scrolling\r\n- Improve the error handling\r\n\r\nInteractive Select\r\n- Add the remaining properties\r\n- Hide the options control\r\n- When `allowNewOptions` is true, `showSearch` should be true\r\n- Show radio group with no header, text header, and `ControlHeader`\r\n\r\nSelect component\r\n- Check/Discuss whether we need the onPaste and on closeOnScrollOut props\r\n- Remove the usage of any from the implementation\r\n- Our interface should only expose single and multiple modes\r\n- Paginate a few px before the bottom of the scroll for better UX\r\n- Investigate why there are two `useEffects` with very similar dependencies and the same code\r\n- Manual testing\r\n- RTL tests\r\n\r\n@geido @villebro @rusackas @junlincc @kgabryje The component continues to be isolated from the rest of the application. Only available in the Storybook. You don't need to test this PR, this will be done in the final iterations. The idea here is to share the current state of the work and give the opportunity to interact with the component and visualize potential improvements.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

Limit\r\n\r\nLimits applied in SQL lab has components \r\n\r\n1) looking for limit imbedded in the sql text \r\n2) select input with limit. \r\n\r\nto apply the more strict limit there are the functions to top look for a limit amount in the text then update it with the more strict. \r\n\r\nSince Teradata uses TOP we are proposing t changes. \r\n1) add set_or_update_query_limit_top function to sql parse to find the top value in sql text\r\n2) adding exception teradata.py to apply top when it is a Teradata Connection\r\n\r\nWe think this approach solves any concerns since the \r\nset_or_update_query_limit_top function can be reused by and other RDMS that uses Top and the database-specific functions can be used to look for and apply it when neccarasy. \r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nIf none of the datasets used by charts on current dashboard have any temporal columns, there's no point in applying Time range, Time column or Time grain filters to them. This PR implements disables selecting those filter types on dashboards without datasets with temporal columns.\r\nAlso, there's no point in pre-filtering by time range datasets without temporal columns. This PR implements hiding time range picker pre-filter if current dataset doesn't have temporal columns.\r\nI also removed \"px\" suffix from \"0px\" css values to remove linter warnings.\r\n\r\nSecond part of the related issue (https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/15068) was excluding charts that use dataset without temporal columns from scope when creating a time filter. We've decided to handle this as a separate issue (https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14977). CC @junlincc \r\n\r\n\r\nRejected alternatives: hiding time filters instead of disabling options in select button. We decided that it might be confusing for the users if some filter types just \"disappeared\".\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: see https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/15068\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nCase 1: only datasets without temporal columns - time filters disabled, time range pre-filter hidden\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/122394612-7589fc80-cf76-11eb-9af4-f3662b71d432.mov\r\n\r\nCase 2: only some datasets have temporal columns - time filters enabled, time range pre-filter hidden if a dataset without temporal columns is selected (\"threads\" dataset has temporal columns, \"members_channels_2\" doesn't)\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/122388521-3eb0e800-cf70-11eb-96b6-ad5f2651bf69.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0. Enable `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` feature flag\r\n1. Create a dashboard using datasets without temporal columns (e.g. `covid_vaccines` from test data)\r\n2. Open native filters modal, verify that only Value and Numerical Range filter types are enabled.\r\n3. Create a dashboard using multiple datasets, some of which have temporal columns, and some don't\r\n4. Open native filters modal, verify that all 5 filter types are available\r\n5. Select a dataset with temporal columns and check `Pre-filter available values`. Verify that time range filter shows up\r\n6. Select a dataset without temporal columns and go to pre-filtering section. Verify that time range filter doesn't show up.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/issues/15004\r\nThis PR disable `Apply` button for for native filters if one of the required filters are missed, it includes:\r\n\r\n1. In filter config modal force user check default value if `Required` checkbox enabled\r\n2. Highlight errored filter in filter bar, for this puporse we added to fields to `filterState: { validateStatus, validateMessage }`\r\n3. Meantime it has hardcoded logic for `enableEmptyFilter` field as `Required` flag, in future I think it should be changed\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56388545/122372582-75cfcb00-cf69-11eb-83ed-c40754ecd6e9.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWe were seeing some duplicate client_id errors when running queries. Here's the root cause: \r\n\r\nWhen we have a timeout on a query, we return a 408 , and when most browsers get a 408 response, they automatically retry the request. The issue with the query POST request is that the db request happens after we create the query, so if the db request times out, then the retry fails because the request is not idempotent, due to the fact that the client_id is created on the client and has a uniqueness constraint in the db. \r\n\r\nMy solution here is to check to see if the query exists and if it is in a pending or timed out state, don't resave it, but rather just return the original query.\r\n\r\nI had thought of a few different options for this issue, and here are the reasonings why I didn't go with other solutions: \r\n1) change client_id to query.id and generate it server side. The reason that we have the id generated client side and stored in the db is so that we can stop the query before the original response has returned. \r\n2) return something other than a 408 when the db has timed out. If the db timeout is long, it's possible that the server will time out before the db and we'll likely still be left with the same issue. \r\n3) run the db request before saving the query. Because the same endpoint is used with async query requests, the refactor would be much more prone to errors. \r\n\r\nSome concerns/questions: \r\nIf a query is new, and happens to match an existing query that is running, (unlikely but possible), we don't want to return someone else's query. There's a check on this lookup for user_id, but that can be null. There's also a lookup on sql_editor_id. My assumption is that with the combination of these three factors, we should with certainty only get the request that we are intending, but I'd welcome another set of eyes on that. The last option is to check the sql string, but the comparison on what could potentially be a long string may be costly. \r\n\r\nIn my testing, I was never able to reproduce a server timeout response, only a netstat error, and the query continued to have a status of \"running\" which means that it will continue to be polled for. You have to explicitly delete the query if you navigate away from the page without stopping the query. I didn't change that behavior, but it's something that we may want to investigate. \r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo visual changes\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nIf you are testing locally and can put a debug statement somewhere in the sql_json POST request you can replicate a timeout. After about 2 minutes, you should see another sql_json POST request in your browser network tab, and it should return a 200 with the original query, and not raise an error. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nCurrent formula to determine first day of the week `DATEADD(week, DATEDIFF(week, 0, {col}), 0)` returns incorrect results.\r\nE.g. for date `2021-06-13` it returns `2021-06-14` but by definition first day of the week should be less or equal all other week days.\r\nSo I fixed it and also add explicit sunday- and monday-beginning intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nYou can use any DB Fiddle for MS SQL to validate this change:\r\n```sql\r\nselect \r\n  DATEADD(week, DATEDIFF(week, 0, '2021-06-13'), 0) as Incorrect,\r\n  DATEADD(day, -1, DATEADD(week, DATEDIFF(week,

SUMMARY\r\nTo be able to filter out unnecessary filter types on the native filters config form (primarily temporal filters, but potentially others later), we need to know what types of datatypes are available on the datasets that are referenced on the dashboard. While we recently added the `type_generic` field to the column object (see #14863) and could iterate through all columns to check if they are temporal or not, the list of columns that are returned by the response from `api/v1/dashboard/<pk>/datasets` have been pre-filtered to contain only a subset of the actually featured columns. Therefore, we either need to return the full list of columns in the response, or add a new field that contains a list of datatypes featured in the dataset columns. To avoid bloating the response payload, this PR proposes adding the latter, i.e. a new field `column_types` to the response, that contains a list of all `GenericDataType`s that are featured in the dataset columns.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nWith this change, a new property `column_types` is available on

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThere are (or were) some hidden inputs in the Explore control panel, which were taking up about a pixel each vertically, thanks to Bootstrap. This PR simply adds a `display:none` to the controls that are of type `HiddenControl` to take them out of the DOM layout. They should still submit properly in all modern-ish browsers. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nComing soon...\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
