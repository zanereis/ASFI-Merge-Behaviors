If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-11T14:32:04Z","updated_at":"2021-07-12T04:03:20Z","closed_at":"2021-07-12T04:03:20Z","merged_at":"2021-07-12T04:03:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"2e8dca636792f354f31661eca0d151e12a79cd4f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8265/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8265/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8265/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/030b030d950523460a9728c481cd6d0648faa214","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue-8244-3.0","ref":"up-dev-issue-8244-3.0","sha":"030b030d950523460a9728c481cd6d0648faa214","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-11T08:40:32Z","updated_at":"2021-07-11T13:15:56Z","closed_at":"2021-07-11T13:15:56Z","merged_at":"2021-07-11T13:15:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"5b83a98692871bd6a36d739a7fcdd1a5b9d21f82","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8262/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8262/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8262/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a89d32540f89f5c8cf87b171bc7808d5fcfff77c","head":{"label":"JasmineJ1230:3.0_service_config","ref":"3.0_service_config","sha":"a89d32540f89f5c8cf87b171bc7808d5fcfff77c","user":{"login":"JasmineJ1230","id":53425041,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDI1MDQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53425041?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230","html_url":"https://github.com/JasmineJ1230","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":384876629,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODQ4NzY2Mjk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"JasmineJ1230/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JasmineJ1230","id":53425041,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDI1MDQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53425041?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230","html_url":"https://github.com/JasmineJ1230","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasmineJ1230/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JasmineJ1230/dubbo","description":"Apache

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2021-07-09T10:54:16Z","updated_at":"2021-07-11T13:18:22Z","closed_at":"2021-07-11T13:18:22Z","merged_at":"2021-07-11T13:18:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"b722a201e9b91b7023a09fb886cdf32ba5ad654e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8252/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8252/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8252/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5c67ae6f776b7c3e6f397a1b69dc00d712501abf","head":{"label":"Huijing-Xu:feature_ut_port","ref":"feature_ut_port","sha":"5c67ae6f776b7c3e6f397a1b69dc00d712501abf","user":{"login":"Huijing-Xu","id":38981310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTgxMzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38981310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu","html_url":"https://github.com/Huijing-Xu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":369134893,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjkxMzQ4OTM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"Huijing-Xu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Huijing-Xu","id":38981310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTgxMzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38981310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu","html_url":"https://github.com/Huijing-Xu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huijing-Xu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Huijing-Xu/dubbo","description":"Apache

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-08T17:35:00Z","updated_at":"2021-07-13T02:17:13Z","closed_at":"2021-07-12T01:58:26Z","merged_at":"2021-07-12T01:58:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"b7d60ce121479bffce1a416b5ce1b8b798fd2eec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8246/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8246/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8246/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/21f3517ded4bafa833ab61e7e1482ddc62fbeea3","head":{"label":"pinxiong:issue#8245","ref":"issue#8245","sha":"21f3517ded4bafa833ab61e7e1482ddc62fbeea3","user":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349733065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk3MzMwNjU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"pinxiong/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-06T15:45:05Z","updated_at":"2021-07-11T13:12:34Z","closed_at":"2021-07-11T13:12:34Z","merged_at":"2021-07-11T13:12:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"a4dcaf416c7177c5db3a86341569dd710afe3792","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8236/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8236/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8236/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0275b3ba4d253aee2ccea0a3dac7950cb062757f","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue-8235-3.0","ref":"up-dev-issue-8235-3.0","sha":"0275b3ba4d253aee2ccea0a3dac7950cb062757f","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-06T09:34:33Z","updated_at":"2021-10-23T04:47:29Z","closed_at":"2021-07-08T14:13:23Z","merged_at":"2021-07-08T14:13:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"02a366c64fd0642cef513c9451a94934122357e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8232/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8232/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8232/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0543fe44b576344bc4ebb4a866e9d1f732e8ba13","head":{"label":"kylixs:3.0-remove-lifecycle-component-listener-0706","ref":"3.0-remove-lifecycle-component-listener-0706","sha":"0543fe44b576344bc4ebb4a866e9d1f732e8ba13","user":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":305677990,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDU2Nzc5OTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kylixs/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-05T02:20:25Z","updated_at":"2021-07-13T02:17:10Z","closed_at":"2021-07-08T14:07:52Z","merged_at":"2021-07-08T14:07:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"aef74db40405e685f5f5b8a52e3c643f3cdd8158","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8219/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8219/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8219/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8d354edc46cd8a00ea261a3720c7342692ac2e19","head":{"label":"pinxiong:issue#8218","ref":"issue#8218","sha":"8d354edc46cd8a00ea261a3720c7342692ac2e19","user":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349733065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk3MzMwNjU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"pinxiong/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-03T11:41:35Z","updated_at":"2021-07-04T03:06:49Z","closed_at":"2021-07-04T03:06:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3120392ecc145a5daa77ee28f139d80682c50beb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8214/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8214/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8214/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/090466d59f38816f10007cdeb98d920126ae08f2","head":{"label":"fangliji:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"090466d59f38816f10007cdeb98d920126ae08f2","user":{"login":"fangliji","id":86839680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODM5Njgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86839680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji","html_url":"https://github.com/fangliji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":382372832,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODIzNzI4MzI=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"fangliji/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fangliji","id":86839680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODM5Njgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86839680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji","html_url":"https://github.com/fangliji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangliji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fangliji/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nfix connectSync not work\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-03T09:20:48Z","updated_at":"2021-07-05T16:48:59Z","closed_at":"2021-07-05T16:48:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1b48a637fe9a05c7d13584bc8885ba5e4912ad75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8211/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8211/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8211/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/297559f7fe3466857c91221e7a7d7eb8c4e6eb50","head":{"label":"jiangxch:issue8210","ref":"issue8210","sha":"297559f7fe3466857c91221e7a7d7eb8c4e6eb50","user":{"login":"jiangxch","id":61080164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDgwMTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61080164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":295462662,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTU0NjI2NjI=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"jiangxch/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxch","id":61080164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDgwMTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61080164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxch/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-01T09:08:57Z","updated_at":"2021-10-23T04:47:37Z","closed_at":"2021-07-02T05:31:34Z","merged_at":"2021-07-02T05:31:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"810c82456fcadcc7cdb39d063f71af7c12c14fa4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8198/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8198/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8198/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/08e61b3e37dd86dd0953594f50ce8494741e9878","head":{"label":"kylixs:3.0-duplicated-config-checking-0630","ref":"3.0-duplicated-config-checking-0630","sha":"08e61b3e37dd86dd0953594f50ce8494741e9878","user":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":305677990,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDU2Nzc5OTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kylixs/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs/dubbo","description":"Apache

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-01T02:41:59Z","updated_at":"2021-07-05T02:24:51Z","closed_at":"2021-07-02T05:26:23Z","merged_at":"2021-07-02T05:26:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"0e5de864712d03df53e5b9fa75585b9ab46978bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8191/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8191/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8191/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8f8632a0a87f12367577884c8443439d25d3c778","head":{"label":"70-cloud-lab:3.0.1-dev","ref":"3.0.1-dev","sha":"8f8632a0a87f12367577884c8443439d25d3c778","user":{"login":"70-cloud-lab","id":61860043,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxODYwMDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61860043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab","html_url":"https://github.com/70-cloud-lab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":345975894,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDU5NzU4OTQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"70-cloud-lab/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"70-cloud-lab","id":61860043,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxODYwMDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61860043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab","html_url":"https://github.com/70-cloud-lab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/70-cloud-lab/dubbo","description":"Apache

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large,

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-30T10:23:06Z","updated_at":"2021-10-23T04:47:32Z","closed_at":"2021-07-08T14:04:43Z","merged_at":"2021-07-08T14:04:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"b260d45a69354ebba5c112ce7a54b2f58ffef75a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8187/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8187/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8187/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/995e7de1bb1bb0d012bd2eb98c0d4f33104250e8","head":{"label":"kylixs:3.0-improve-property-resolving-0630","ref":"3.0-improve-property-resolving-0630","sha":"995e7de1bb1bb0d012bd2eb98c0d4f33104250e8","user":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":305677990,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDU2Nzc5OTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kylixs/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-30T04:57:15Z","updated_at":"2021-07-13T02:17:10Z","closed_at":"2021-07-02T05:21:14Z","merged_at":"2021-07-02T05:21:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"6283eb44e1f35d91cc880b9090683677a53c2170","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8183/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8183/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8183/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5d47cc381539e5da431fedc6dd37923ffe2c4369","head":{"label":"pinxiong:issue#8182","ref":"issue#8182","sha":"5d47cc381539e5da431fedc6dd37923ffe2c4369","user":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349733065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk3MzMwNjU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"pinxiong/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-30T03:05:09Z","updated_at":"2021-07-01T02:50:01Z","closed_at":"2021-07-01T02:50:00Z","merged_at":"2021-07-01T02:50:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"e7b41b2a3d54cb62133b9bb6bfe510a70de199c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8180/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8180/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8180/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/199a2cbc40cf2dfc2fddd027c36974b9bdff78bb","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0630_opt_metadatainfo","ref":"0630_opt_metadatainfo","sha":"199a2cbc40cf2dfc2fddd027c36974b9bdff78bb","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-29T14:10:25Z","updated_at":"2021-07-19T06:50:42Z","closed_at":"2021-07-19T06:50:42Z","merged_at":"2021-07-19T06:50:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"a2711f9e2e2becc91ffc2b375c3b749dc0d24a38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8175/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8175/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8175/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0022e554482101d7c3680c27c98f8aeafca4dd30","head":{"label":"AbelSara:baseCommand-support","ref":"baseCommand-support","sha":"0022e554482101d7c3680c27c98f8aeafca4dd30","user":{"login":"AbelSara","id":29270918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjcwOTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29270918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara","html_url":"https://github.com/AbelSara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":380715270,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODA3MTUyNzA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AbelSara/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AbelSara","id":29270918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjcwOTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29270918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara","html_url":"https://github.com/AbelSara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbelSara/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AbelSara/dubbo","description":"Apache

(String)\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-29T07:16:23Z","updated_at":"2021-07-12T13:44:58Z","closed_at":"2021-07-08T13:51:35Z","merged_at":"2021-07-08T13:51:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"0b067c628b6c9f7437aaaf9e71372d06953f4738","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8169/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8169/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8169/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c5b83fab8ca40411f93e2e3b5d18a7141bdbea62","head":{"label":"hunjipo:pray-replace-append","ref":"pray-replace-append","sha":"c5b83fab8ca40411f93e2e3b5d18a7141bdbea62","user":{"login":"hunjipo","id":52900961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTAwOTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52900961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo","html_url":"https://github.com/hunjipo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":381215208,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODEyMTUyMDg=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"hunjipo/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hunjipo","id":52900961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTAwOTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52900961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo","html_url":"https://github.com/hunjipo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hunjipo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hunjipo/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nInitialize dubbo config beans before spring singleton beans. \r\nInitialize dubbo bootstrap after loaded config beans, before Spring context refreshed event.\r\n\r\nNew dubbo initialization flow: \r\n```\r\n=> AbstractApplicationContext#refresh()\r\n   => AbstractApplicationContext#invokeBeanFactoryPostProcessors()\r\n       => ServiceAnnotationPostProcessor.postProcessBeanFactory() \r\n       => ReferenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.postProcessBeanFactory() \r\n             publish event DubboAnnotationInitedEvent\r\n   => AbstractApplicationContext#registerBeanPostProcessors()\r\n   => AbstractApplicationContext#registerListeners()\r\n         multicastEvent DubboAnnotationInitedEvent\r\n         load DubboBootstrapApplicationListener\r\n         process event DubboAnnotationInitedEvent (DubboBootstrapApplicationListener#onApplicationEvent)\r\n         => load DubboConfigBeanInitializer bean\r\n               load dubbo config beans\r\n               init reference beans\r\n         => initialize dubbo bootstrap\r\n   =>AbstractApplicationContext#finishBeanFactoryInitialization()\r\n      => beanFactory.preInstantiateSingletons()\r\n            load other non-lazy singleton beans, including service impl beans, ReferenceBeans, ServiceBeans \r\n   =>AbstractApplicationContext#finishRefresh()\r\n      => publish ContextRefreshedEvent\r\n         => start dubbo bootstrap\r\n```              \r\n\r\n**The goal is to initialize dubbo config beans safely after all BeanPostProcessors are registered.** \r\n\r\nPreviously they are initialized in the `DubboConfigInitializationPostProcessor.postProcessBeforeInitialization()` method. **It may fail due to some dubbo config bean being created recursively in java config.** \r\nThe following example demonstrates the failure of init ApplicationConfig by `DubboConfigInitializationPostProcessor`:\r\n```java\r\n@Configuration\r\npublic class ProviderConfiguration {\r\n    @Bean(\"dubbo-demo-application\")\r\n    public ApplicationConfig applicationConfig() {\r\n        ApplicationConfig applicationConfig = new ApplicationConfig();\r\n        applicationConfig.setName(\"dubbo-demo-application\");\r\n        return applicationConfig;\r\n    }\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nbeanFactory.preInstantiateSingletons() \r\n  > getBean(providerConfiguration)  << create providerConfiguration bean first time\r\n  > DubboConfigInitializationPostProcessor.postProcessBeforeInitialization() \r\n  > DubboConfigInitializationPostProcessor.prepareDubboConfigBeans()\r\n  > getBeansOfType(ApplicationConfig.class)  \r\n  > getBean(dubbo-demo-application)  << create application config bean\r\n  > instantiateUsingFactoryMethod \r\n  > getBean(providerConfiguration)  << create factoryBean providerConfiguration bean recursively here\r\n  > BeanCurrentlyInCreationException\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow by processing the `DubboAnnotationInitedEvent` event, it is actually executed after `AbstractApplicationContext#registerBeanPostProcessors()` and before the `AbstractApplicationContext.finishBeanFactoryInitialization()` method. At this time, other beans have not yet begun to be created. This is a good time to process dubbo config beans.\r\n\r\n```\r\nAbstractApplicationContext.registerListeners()\r\n  > DubboBootstrapApplicationListener.onApplicationEvent()\r\n  > getBean(dubboConfigBeanInitializer)\r\n  > DubboConfigBeanInitializer.init()\r\n  > loadConfigBeansOfType(ApplicationConfig.class)\r\n  > getBean(dubbo-demo-application)  << create application config bean \r\n  > instantiateUsingFactoryMethod\r\n  > getBean(providerConfiguration)  << create factoryBean providerConfiguration here \r\n  > instantiate(dubbo-demo-application) \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n* Rename `DubboConfigInitializationPostProcessor` to `DubboConfigBeanInitializer`.\r\n* Add `DubboAnnotationInitedEvent` event for initializing.\r\n* Load config beans by name is more reliable.\r\n* Add `DubboConfigBeanInitializerTest`\r\n* Remove @PostConstruct method from AbstractConfig, register config beans in DubboConfigBeanInitializer, avoid relying on `javax.annotation-api`.  \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nFix issue : the xml configuration is not registered when missing `javax.annotation-api`:  https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/8213\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-29T06:34:18Z","updated_at":"2021-10-23T04:51:09Z","closed_at":"2021-07-10T04:14:33Z","merged_at":"2021-07-10T04:14:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"e3213249cec4a464e5ee47218514fbb2ada828d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8168/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8168/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8168/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/67a4e928015708222841fa1dbb3278a0f4172d4f","head":{"label":"kylixs:3.0-initialize-dubbo-0629","ref":"3.0-initialize-dubbo-0629","sha":"67a4e928015708222841fa1dbb3278a0f4172d4f","user":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":305677990,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDU2Nzc5OTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kylixs/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs/dubbo","description":"Apache

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-29T03:56:46Z","updated_at":"2021-06-30T04:14:00Z","closed_at":"2021-06-30T03:15:20Z","merged_at":"2021-06-30T03:15:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"9279c786b16bddc28111532b5d7ebeed67a9874b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8167/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8167/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8167/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c0f03128b1a4c24f0047bfba4012945f920382b7","head":{"label":"pinxiong:issue#8166","ref":"issue#8166","sha":"c0f03128b1a4c24f0047bfba4012945f920382b7","user":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349733065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk3MzMwNjU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"pinxiong/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-29T01:49:55Z","updated_at":"2021-06-30T03:14:59Z","closed_at":"2021-06-30T03:14:59Z","merged_at":"2021-06-30T03:14:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"dc6dc64b5335a3f3a36f2d99a73b2791078ee4b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8164/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8164/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8164/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/21103ee5ca7dcbd1961209963b091a76633391f9","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue-8162-3.0","ref":"up-dev-issue-8162-3.0","sha":"21103ee5ca7dcbd1961209963b091a76633391f9","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-28T18:20:14Z","updated_at":"2021-07-03T08:57:01Z","closed_at":"2021-07-03T08:57:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"130130e0f8d08178b2c9a8ba12c1cf2b7b89e073","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8163/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8163/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8163/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/580cd8a6d2040c56a16dadcc85140ae3c4760e14","head":{"label":"jiangxch:issue8162","ref":"issue8162","sha":"580cd8a6d2040c56a16dadcc85140ae3c4760e14","user":{"login":"jiangxch","id":61080164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDgwMTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61080164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":295462662,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTU0NjI2NjI=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"jiangxch/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxch","id":61080164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDgwMTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61080164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxch/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n Improve service exported logic.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-28T10:21:31Z","updated_at":"2021-06-28T11:59:51Z","closed_at":"2021-06-28T11:01:21Z","merged_at":"2021-06-28T11:01:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"0495567b00ef1349f452928e6fdf926e429c1432","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8160/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8160/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8160/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d9ac356096ac926f002fe5beca722026b1745208","head":{"label":"kylixs:3.0-protect-service-exported-method","ref":"3.0-protect-service-exported-method","sha":"d9ac356096ac926f002fe5beca722026b1745208","user":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":305677990,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDU2Nzc5OTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kylixs/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-27T23:46:42Z","updated_at":"2021-06-28T23:20:55Z","closed_at":"2021-06-28T11:22:44Z","merged_at":"2021-06-28T11:22:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"532ce72f8377abf8ff659430b86e0919c9aff562","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8154/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8154/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8154/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1522f5325e51e052c23d35d1886ed206d285e4bd","head":{"label":"pinxiong:issue#8153","ref":"issue#8153","sha":"1522f5325e51e052c23d35d1886ed206d285e4bd","user":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349733065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk3MzMwNjU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"pinxiong/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong/dubbo","description":"Apache

-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-26T21:57:09Z","updated_at":"2021-06-28T11:20:44Z","closed_at":"2021-06-28T11:20:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8148/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8148/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8148/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/11b99365af6ee02bbb9c93a4a1de49f79fdd2eb6","head":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"11b99365af6ee02bbb9c93a4a1de49f79fdd2eb6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-26T14:19:50Z","updated_at":"2021-06-30T03:10:12Z","closed_at":"2021-06-30T03:10:12Z","merged_at":"2021-06-30T03:10:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"7a5074875831fa83a41ca3f92f5668014b4d4689","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8147/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8147/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8147/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8619700ef11a95d0800d2c0541a337f7c2a56e2d","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue-8146-3.0","ref":"up-dev-issue-8146-3.0","sha":"8619700ef11a95d0800d2c0541a337f7c2a56e2d","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-25T16:02:18Z","updated_at":"2024-12-08T02:04:14Z","closed_at":"2021-06-27T04:20:15Z","merged_at":"2021-06-27T04:20:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"01f2261bad9c2b891084f3e681a36fb0ee9785be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8144/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8144/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8144/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9ef00b6c6b17f17667b634d48dcf0f144fd10dfc","head":{"label":"kylixs:3.0-ignore-equivalent-configs","ref":"3.0-ignore-equivalent-configs","sha":"9ef00b6c6b17f17667b634d48dcf0f144fd10dfc","user":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":305677990,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDU2Nzc5OTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kylixs/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs/dubbo","description":"Apache

-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-25T02:21:38Z","updated_at":"2021-10-23T04:47:48Z","closed_at":"2021-06-25T04:33:30Z","merged_at":"2021-06-25T04:33:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"f488cb3a10093ac2c361ac6de696201e0e8a30af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8138/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8138/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8138/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/680e89a4250683888be395ded8b0384944743732","head":{"label":"kylixs:3.0-fix-service-bootstrap","ref":"3.0-fix-service-bootstrap","sha":"680e89a4250683888be395ded8b0384944743732","user":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":305677990,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDU2Nzc5OTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kylixs/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs/dubbo","description":"Apache

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-24T07:20:56Z","updated_at":"2021-06-24T07:23:20Z","closed_at":"2021-06-24T07:23:20Z","merged_at":"2021-06-24T07:23:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"33e46df33069e5f103a8f919c9b9824647150a4e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8131/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8131/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8131/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/68c28f0d8bf12d5a8bcc726b91b9167d7508dff1","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0624_fix_meta","ref":"0624_fix_meta","sha":"68c28f0d8bf12d5a8bcc726b91b9167d7508dff1","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-24T05:21:38Z","updated_at":"2021-06-24T07:14:04Z","closed_at":"2021-06-24T07:14:03Z","merged_at":"2021-06-24T07:14:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"82f5665684be51b03e08163a6daa4f5b9d24354d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8129/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8129/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8129/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c5ad4db2cf0390cd51e6f99166f773274b7090c0","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0624_fix_migration","ref":"0624_fix_migration","sha":"c5ad4db2cf0390cd51e6f99166f773274b7090c0","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nOptimize delay export service logic. \r\n\r\nPre condition:\r\nIf module A and B dependency the same dubbo-config core, and it define netty server port is 20880, config delay export service time is 1000 and protocol is dubbo. \r\n\r\nUsage scenarios:\r\nWhen I run module B after successfully started module A at the same compute, module B can successfully started, but module B not export any service, because module A occupied 21880 port. \r\n\r\nConclusion：\r\nSo, I think delay export service should print stack trace if there are exception occur so that programmer can see errors in console.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-23T12:09:46Z","updated_at":"2021-10-23T04:47:53Z","closed_at":"2021-06-24T05:21:52Z","merged_at":"2021-06-24T05:21:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"83d020cdc0052689538130a89d647f1f0aa8a433","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8123/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8123/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8123/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0cf2a947ae339fba80f92961aa12a7189d9fe078","head":{"label":"kylixs:3.0-bootstrap-servlet-listener","ref":"3.0-bootstrap-servlet-listener","sha":"0cf2a947ae339fba80f92961aa12a7189d9fe078","user":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":305677990,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDU2Nzc5OTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kylixs/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-22T02:49:52Z","updated_at":"2021-06-28T07:38:16Z","closed_at":"2021-06-23T02:46:56Z","merged_at":"2021-06-23T02:46:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"44f2f6b0d7de00c2b892d150e6ef97010847f643","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8113/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8113/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8113/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1d2256d761be53685e86b887f4ebf7031942ca6d","head":{"label":"kylixs:3.0-test-reference-tag","ref":"3.0-test-reference-tag","sha":"1d2256d761be53685e86b887f4ebf7031942ca6d","user":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":305677990,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDU2Nzc5OTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kylixs/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-22T02:08:42Z","updated_at":"2021-06-22T03:44:55Z","closed_at":"2021-06-22T03:44:55Z","merged_at":"2021-06-22T03:44:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"84803247e4435030dec8a72295348d25e855cbdf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8112/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8112/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8112/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e321d6ef6e2ff66b9e77f75e962a95cefffe4ab5","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:fix_compatiable","ref":"fix_compatiable","sha":"e321d6ef6e2ff66b9e77f75e962a95cefffe4ab5","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-20T08:54:37Z","updated_at":"2021-06-24T07:51:04Z","closed_at":"2021-06-24T07:51:04Z","merged_at":"2021-06-24T07:51:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"0db6fe237933405992ec4f6a51fb6b88fcb007cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8106/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8106/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8106/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9b674d1de835f44440a6dde2aa0ca084368fbda9","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue-8105-3.0","ref":"up-dev-issue-8105-3.0","sha":"9b674d1de835f44440a6dde2aa0ca084368fbda9","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache
