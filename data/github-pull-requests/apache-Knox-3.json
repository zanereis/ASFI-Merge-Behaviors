What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith this change, our end-users have a way to define custom application path aliases next to the ones we have OOTB to reach certain apps, UIs.\r\nI added the following `gateway-site.xml` property(ies) to support this feature:\r\n```\r\n    <property>\r\n        <name>gateway.application.path.alias.$original-application-path-to-match</name>\r\n        <value>$comma-separated-list-of-alias-names</value>\r\n    </property>\r\n```\r\nwhere\r\n- $original-application-path-to-match indicates the existing application path we would like to have an alias for\r\n- $comma-separated-list-of-alias-names marks the list of alias names to register (pointing to the same application as the original path above), separated by a comma if there are more\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\n```\r\n    <property>\r\n        <name>gateway.application.path.alias.token-generation</name>\r\n        <value>tokengen</value>\r\n    </property>\r\n```\r\nwill allow end-users to reach the Token Generation UI on both `.../token-generation/index.html` and `.../tokengen/index.html`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated JUnit tests and conducted manual testing:\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOzone SCM UI uses placeholders such as `{{typestat.portval.toLowerCase()}}` in the HTML which are supposed to be replaced by JavaScript code. However this is the same syntax what knox uses for template variables. If no escaping is used knox will populate the the template variable with an empty string since it has no value.\r\n\r\nBut escaping `{` didn't work originally in rewrite templates (so `\\{x\\}` resulted literally `\\{x\\}`).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nsandbox topology:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<service>\r\n    <role>OZONE-SCM</role>\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPreviously if there were multiple OMs/SCMs in a cluster on the Knox UI if you clicked on any of the OM/SCM UIs it was consistently showing one of the OMs/SCMs UI, because `$serviceUrl[OZONE-SCM]` was picking the first URL from the three in the `cdp-proxy.xml`.\r\n\r\nIn this fix I add a `?host={host}` to the ending of the URLs and used that `{host}` later when rewriting the requests, so it will go to the correct host. I added a separate route for the documentation to work in the UIs. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested it in a cluster and all the 3 OMs/SCMs cards on the Knox UI page are redirecting to the corresponding OM/SCM UI page. \r\n\r\nOM UI:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1726\" alt=\"om_ui\"

<code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> to further address CVE-2020-8908 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/4011\">#4011</a>) and CVE-2023-2976 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/2575\">#2575</a>). (feb83a1c8f)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While CVE-2020-8908 was officially closed when we deprecated <code>Files.createTempDir</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v30.0\">Guava 30.0</a>, we've heard from users that even recent versions of Guava have been listed as vulnerable in <em>other</em> databases of security vulnerabilities. In response, we've reimplemented the method (and the very rarely used <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> class, which had a similar issue) to eliminate the insecure behavior entirely. This change could technically affect users in a number of different ways (discussed under &quot;Incompatible changes&quot; below), but in practice, the only problem users are likely to encounter is with Windows. If you are using those APIs under Windows, you should skip 32.0.0 and go straight to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a> which fixes the problem. (Unfortunately, we didn't think of the Windows problem until after the release. And while we <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava#important-warnings\">warn that <code>common.io</code> in particular may not work under Windows</a>, we didn't intend to regress support.) Sorry for the trouble.</p>\n<h4>Incompatible changes</h4>\n<p>Although this release bumps Guava's major version number, it makes <strong>no binary-incompatible changes to the <code>guava</code> artifact</strong>.</p>\n<p>One change could cause issues for Widows users, and a few other changes could cause issues for users in more usual situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The new implementations of <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6535\">throw an exception under Windows</a>.</strong> This is fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a>. Sorry for the trouble.</li>\n<li>This release makes a binary-incompatible change to a <code>@Beta</code> API in the <strong>separate artifact</strong> <code>guava-testlib</code>. Specifically, we changed the return type of <code>TestingExecutors.sameThreadScheduledExecutor</code> to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. The old return type was a package-private class, which caused the Kotlin compiler to produce warnings. (dafaa3e435)</li>\n<li>This release <em>adds</em> two methods to the Android flavor of Guava: <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. Those methods do not work under an Android VM; we added them only to help our tests of the Android flavor (since we also run those tests under a JRE). Android VMs tolerate such methods as long as the app does not call them or perform reflection on them, and builds tolerate them because of our new Proguard configurations (discussed below). Thus, we expect no impact to most users. However, we could imagine build problems for users who have set up their own build system for the Android flavor of Guava. Please report any problems so that we can judge how safely we might be able to add other methods to the Android flavor in the future, such as APIs that use Java 8 classes like <code>Stream</code>.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDescriptors are reloaded before topology redeployment at startup. Thus, Knox will have the up-to-date version of the XML topology files generated from the JSON descriptor before it's deployed as a web app in Knox.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested in a secure (i.e. Kerberos-enabled) cluster with high demand on getting a Knox Token using a topology with HadoopAuth authentication in place. Before my changes, the token generation failed 99% of the time. After the fix went in, all tokens were acquired properly.\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-08T11:04:29Z","updated_at":"2023-06-08T13:04:57Z","closed_at":"2023-06-08T13:04:53Z","merged_at":"2023-06-08T13:04:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"cd0ef17113caf546ac0a3ec32f82acba42959c2c","assignee":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"moresandeep","id":380997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep","html_url":"https://github.com/moresandeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pzampino","id":13018719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDE4NzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13018719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino","html_url":"https://github.com/pzampino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1743904891,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzQzOTA0ODkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/labels/topology-generation","name":"topology-generation","color":"7bbde5","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1775216053,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzc1MjE2MDUz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/labels/descriptor","name":"descriptor","color":"1f2884","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2242736291,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjQyNzM2Mjkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/labels/HadoopAuth","name":"HadoopAuth","color":"4d8401","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/760/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/760/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.c

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis commit consists of the following changes:\r\n- the new-style \"Expect:100-continue\" approach for PUT/POST requests is disabled by default\r\n- the new-style \"Expect:100-continue\" approach is enabled for the ATLAS, ATLAS-API, HIVE, RANGER and RANGER-UI services\r\n- make sure that this feature for the WEBHDFS service is turned off even in its own service definition file (so that if the default is changed back to true, we'll be safe)\r\n- HTTP entity creation relies on the 'addExpect100Continue' boolean flag\r\n- implemented the missing method overload in HdfsHttpClientDispatch\r\n- KnoxBufferedHttpEntity shall not read content at entity creation time (content reading is postponed until dispatch time when the back-end

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere is an ordering issue between the topology service + hadoop xml resource monitor. The topology service is started first, and it'll immediately trigger an onChange event on all descriptors. Hadoop xml resource monitor will create the providers afterwards so it can happen that even the provider is available (in the hxr) the file is not yet generated therefore the topology won't be generated due to the missing provider.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. Created a descriptor with a non existing provider\r\n\r\n```\r\nsample_topology2\r\nproviderConfigRef=testProviders2##WEBHDFS:url=https://dummy:7189\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Restarteed kox\r\n\r\n3.

Added the missing provider\r\n\r\n```\r\nproviderConfigs:testProviders2\r\nrole=authentication#authentication.name=ShiroProvider\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Restarted knox\r\n\r\n6.

<value>enabled=true;maxFailoverAttempts=3;failoverSleep=1000;failoverNonIdempotentRequestEnabled=true</value>\r\n</param>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTested locally, added unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-21T20:41:11Z","updated_at":"2023-03-23T22:15:29Z","closed_at":"2023-03-23T18:38:39Z","merged_at":"2023-03-23T18:38:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"1b54d520b3ba0ef6d1e5b7b816d3ddf67fd2bfab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zeroflag","id":641365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag","html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/742/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/742/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/742/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/statuses/e474a63ae3af2aef9ecaac6f5a4f7f6266e5c97c","head":{"label":"moresandeep:KNOX-2890","ref":"KNOX-2890","sha":"e474a63ae3af2aef9ecaac6f5a4f7f6266e5c97c","user":{"login":"moresandeep","id":380997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep","html_url":"https://github.com/moresandeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":69282185,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTI4MjE4NQ==","name":"knox","full_name":"moresandeep/knox","private":false,"owner":{"login":"moresandeep","id":380997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep","html_url":"https://github.com/moresandeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/moresandeep/knox","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDescriptors and providers which are managed externally and marked as read only should not be regenerated by the hadoop resource monitor.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested the following scenarios:\r\n\r\nTopology with static URL.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tname  = custom\r\n\tvalue = providerConfigRef=pam#WEBHDFS:url=http://dummy\r\n```\r\n\r\nTopology with discovered service URL.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tname  = custom\r\n\tvalue = providerConfigRef=pam#discoveryAddress=http://disco.address:7180#discoveryType=ClouderaManager#cluster=Cluster 1#NAMENODE#WEBHDFS\r\n```\r\n\r\nMixing static URL with discovery.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tname  = custom\r\n\tvalue = providerConfigRef=pam#discoveryAddress=http://disco.address:7180#discoveryType=ClouderaManager#cluster=Cluster 1#NAMENODE#WEBHDFS:url=dummy\t\r\n```\r\n\r\nI checked that the topology ( /var/lib/knox/gateway/conf/topologies/custom.xml ) was only created if it was not added to `gateway.read.only.override.topologies`.\r\n\r\nI checked the same for shared providers.\r\n\r\nSingle provider:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tname  = providerConfigs:mypam\r\n\tvalue = role=authentication#authentication.name=ShiroProvider\t\r\n```\r\n\r\nMultiple providers:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tname  = providerConfigs:mypam,mypam2\r\n\trole=authentication#authentication.name=ShiroProvider\r\n```\r\n\r\nI added `mypam` to `gateway.read.only.override.providers` so that only mypam2 was regenerated.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-28T13:05:18Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T16:33:25Z","closed_at":"2023-03-01T16:33:25Z","merged_at":"2023-03-01T16:33:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"6512cc8703385d7daebfbd434b6638eed1b609dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"moresandeep","id":380997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep","html_url":"https://github.com/moresandeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/734/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/734/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/734/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/statuses/21865cbd88f8eb5a96557c0c25c839d22aff95e2","head":{"label":"zeroflag:KNOX-2884-skip","ref":"KNOX-2884-skip","sha":"21865cbd88f8eb5a96557c0c25c839d22aff95e2","user":{"login":"zeroflag","id":641365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag","html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":383792950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODM3OTI5NTA=","name":"knox","full_name":"zeroflag/knox","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zeroflag","id":641365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag","html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag/knox","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs described in the corresponding JIRA, Knox should handle the situation when a previously stored CM discovery config file exists, but it's empty. This may prevent the Knox Gateway from starting up.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new JUnit test cases to cover this event and ran manual testing:\r\n- Stopped the Knox GW in a cluster where I had descriptors with CM service discovery enabled\r\n- truncted the `$KNOX_GW_DATA_DIR/cm_clusters/xyz.conf` file\r\n- restarted the Knox Gateway\r\n\r\nPrior to my changes, the Knox GW did not start; After my fix, everything is working as expected.","created_at":"2023-02-02T14:05:02Z","updated_at":"2023-02-03T10:40:52Z","closed_at":"2023-02-03T10:40:47Z","merged_at":"2023-02-03T10:40:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"e9b3d9e5005d2bd40f5013b508a84a14c8ea31f8","assignee":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"moresandeep","id":380997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep","html_url":"https://github.com/moresandeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pzampino","id":13018719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDE4NzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13018719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino","html_url":"https://github.com/pzampino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2003085668,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDAzMDg1NjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/labels/service-discovery","name":"service-discovery","color":"a52234","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/722/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/722/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/722/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/statuses/63558dc79efe30d4d7b98163a2e026d330ec352a","head":{"label":"smolnar82:KNOX-2869","ref":"KNOX-2869","sha":"63558dc79efe30d4d7b98163a2e026d330ec352a","user":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn section SRV.3.1.1 of Servlet spec states that any access to request parameters of an \"x-www-form-urlencoded\" request (e.g. using HttpServletRequest#getParameter()) can trigger the early consumption of the request InputStream.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nrequest.getParameter(\"doAs\");\r\nIOUtils.toString(request.getInputStream()); // <= This will be empty because getParameter() already consumed the stream\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis causes knox to dispatch an empty request body to the service (HadoopAuthFilter always check the doAs param).\r\n\r\nHow is it fixed?\r\n\r\nKnox as a proxy doesn't care about the request params coming from the request body. This patch introduces a wrapper class that only gets the parameters of the  \"x-www-form-urlencoded\" requests from the query string, ignoring the body altogether.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested it manually with curl.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl -u admin:admin-password -H \"X-XSRF-Header: whatever\" -k -X POST -d \"a=1&b=2\" \"https://localhost:8443/gateway/sandbox/hive?a=3\"\r\n```","created_at":"2023-01-26T11:24:37Z","updated_at":"2023-01-26T14:49:49Z","closed_at":"2023-01-26T14:49:49Z","merged_at":"2023-01-26T14:49:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"58328b6bddd9c39abf790a36d8ea5cb343cb1754","assignee":{"login":"zeroflag","id":641365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag","html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zeroflag","id":641365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag","html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":83432622,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzQzMjYyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/719/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/719/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/719/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/statuses/7318bda8c6d5cf474d44fea0d57f0c1c40044c68","head":{"label":"zeroflag:KNOX-2865-form","ref":"KNOX-2865-form","sha":"7318bda8c6d5cf474d44fea0d57f0c1c40044c68","user":{"login":"zeroflag","id":641365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag","html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":383792950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODM3OTI5NTA=","name":"knox","full_name":"zeroflag/knox","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zeroflag","id":641365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag","html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zerofla

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe had to change the Oozie rewrite rules more strict not allowing them to mach to any protocol but only http and https. Besides this change additional service routing configuration have to be added not to break the Oozie UI usability.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nOn a Hadoop cluster with Knox installed I edited /var/lib/knox/gateway/data/services/oozie/5.0.0/rewrite.xml and /var/lib/knox/gateway/data/services/oozie/5.0.0/service.xml files to have the final content. After that I deleted the Knox topology deployments then restarted Knox.\r\nAfter that I re-submitted the Oozie workflow which I had issues with earlier. The job submission was successful, the Oozie job executed without any error, the properties were set to the desired values and I was able to see the expected values on the Oozie UI too via Knox.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-25T09:40:15Z","updated_at":"2023-01-25T11:17:07Z","closed_at":"2023-01-25T11:17:07Z","merged_at":"2023-01-25T11:17:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"dfde5c7417cfd111478df30c29f556fd31a2a7d8","assignee":{"login":"moresandeep","id":380997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep","html_url":"https://github.com/moresandeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"moresandeep","id":380997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep","html_url":"https://github.com/moresandeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zeroflag","id":641365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag","html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5076880584,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQgj3s8AAAABLpsMyA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/labels/rewrite-rules","name":"rewrite-rules","color":"2345A4","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/718/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/718/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/718/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/statuses/6ae145bbeab3bc066d707d8524d04db607f57a9f","head":{"label":"dionusos:KNOX-2841-2","ref":"KNOX-2841-2","sha":"6ae145bbeab3bc066d707d8524d04db607f57a9f","user":{"login":"dionusos","id":11403311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDAzMzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11403311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dionusos","html_url":"https://github.com/dionusos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dionusos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dionusos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dionusos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dionusos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dionusos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dionusos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dionusos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dionusos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dionusos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":413763937,"node_id":"R_kgDOGKmJYQ","name":"knox","full_name":"dionusos/knox","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dionus

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere are 2 changes in this PR:\r\n- TLS cipher suites and protocols are now customizable in CM service discovery:\r\n  - end-users can define the TLS protocol(s) and cipher suite(s) to use while creating a secure connection to a CM instance\r\n  - if none is defined, Knox will pick up the relevant supported values from Java's own `java.security` thru the acquired SSL context.\r\n- Added a new method to indicate the TLS protocols to be included when creating SSL context in the embedded Jetty server. Prior to this change, end-users could only tell what to exclude.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit testing and running service discovery in a secure cluster with updated SSL configs.","created_at":"2023-01-24T09:07:49Z","updated_at":"2023-01-25T16:37:23Z","closed_at":"2023-01-25T16:37:18Z","merged_at":"2023-01-25T16:37:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"fb685178890a5db337e7e69392ab4efc04ecf770","assignee":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"moresandeep","id":380997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep","html_url":"https://github.com/moresandeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2003085668,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDAzMDg1NjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/labels/service-discovery","name":"service-discovery","color":"a52234","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4060505413,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQgj3s7yBmVF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/labels/Jetty","name":"Jetty","color":"A59C32","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5072687446,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQgj3s8AAAABLlsRVg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/labels/SSL","name":"SSL","color":"2C8C0F","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/717/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/717/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/717/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/statuses/df2466605454e86f679c9e97cc008e7c51e8b3cd","head":{"label":"smolnar82:KNOX-2864","ref":"KNOX-2864","sha":"df2466605454e86f679c9e97cc008e7c51e8b3cd","user":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.

is very **important** that you created an Apache Knox JIRA for this change and that the PR title/commit message includes the Apache Knox JIRA ID!)\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn HBASE-20904 we added support for /prometheus endpoints under Hbase WebUI. \r\nSo in this PR added configurations to make sure that /prometheus endpoints works fine through the proxy.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nCopied the patched files \"rewrite.xml\" and \"service.xml\" into knox directory and restarted the knox. When opened the Hbase WebUI, the /prometheus endpoint started working as expected. Earlier it used to give 404 error without proxying configurations.\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. For instance: running automated unit/integration tests, manual tests. Please write down your test steps as detailed as possible)\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screen-shot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nPlease review [Knox Contributing

href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf-java's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protobuf Release v3.16.3</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/b8c2488f480bbe3d66b9874c2fcd434201caa48a\"><code>b8c2488</code></a> Updating version.json and repo version numbers to: 16.3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/42e47e5a3fa7219b136f6a5de7c74a89a79245c6\"><code>42e47e5</code></a> Refactoring Java parsing (3.16.x) (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/10668\">#10668</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/98884a8a293488375e10480e5ff1c1f76de9ec8f\"><code>98884a8</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/10556\">#10556</a> from deannagarcia/3.16.x</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/450b648f288f9a6def073f08e3300233bb46c5dd\"><code>450b648</code></a> Cherrypick ruby fixes for monterey</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/b17bb392b46a7bc9d09ae075dc5e8557e246698d\"><code>b17bb39</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/10548\">#10548</a> from protocolbuffers/3.16.x-202209131829</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/c18f5e71d86063fd6cea2c47cd7ab4131db5c9e2\"><code>c18f5e7</code></a> Updating changelog</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/6f4e81791d390cba199184c378e75da40a4965f0\"><code>6f4e817</code></a> Updating version.json and repo version numbers to: 16.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/a7d4e94a4666b722695d9c55ac842d4a3735699e\"><code>a7d4e94</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/10547\">#10547</a> from deannagarcia/3.16.x</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/55815e423bb82cc828836bbd60c79c1f9a195763\"><code>55815e4</code></a> Apply patch</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/152d7bf809dcb24fd9d417d66cf2b270b3654369\"><code>152d7bf</code></a> Update version.json with &quot;lts&quot;: true (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/10535\">#10535</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/compare/v3.16.1...v3.16.3\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java&package-manager=maven&previous-version=3.16.1&new-version=3.16.3)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFrom now on our end-users can define the username and password connection properties as `gateway_database_user` and `gateway_database_password` aliases so that this sensitive information should not be included in the supplied JDBC URL.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, SSL configuration happens for both connection types (JDBC URL or separate property declaration).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated existing JUnit test cases and conducted the following manual testing:\r\n\r\nI configured my local PostgreSQL server to accept SSL connections, enforce passwords and created the following user/DB for testing:\r\n\r\n```\r\npostgres=# CREATE USER smolnar LOGIN PASSWORD 'cloudera';\r\nCREATE ROLE\r\npostgres=# CREATE DATABASE mydatabase WITH OWNER = smolnar;\r\nCREATE DATABASE\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ psql \"sslmode=verify-full host=localhost dbname=mydatabase sslcert=/usr/local/var/postgresql\\@14/root.crt sslrootcert=/usr/local/var/postgresql\\@14/server.crt sslkey=/usr/local/var/postgresql\\@14/root.key user=smolnar\"\r\nPassword for user smolnar: \r\npsql: error: connection to server at \"localhost\" (::1), port 5432 failed: fe_sendauth: no password supplied\r\n\r\n$ psql \"sslmode=verify-full host=localhost dbname=mydatabase sslcert=/usr/local/var/postgresql\\@14/root.crt sslrootcert=/usr/local/var/postgresql\\@14/server.crt sslkey=/usr/local/var/postgresql\\@14/root.key user=smolnar password=cloudera\"\r\npsql (14.6 (Homebrew))\r\nSSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)\r\nType \"help\" for help.\r\n\r\nmydatabase=> \r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen all this was done, I configured Knox to use `JDBCTokenStateService` as follows and generated tokens:\r\n```\r\n    <property>\r\n        <name>gateway.service.tokenstate.impl</name>\r\n        <value>org.apache.knox.gateway.services.token.impl.JDBCTokenStateService</value>\r\n    </property>\r\n     <property>\r\n        <name>gateway.database.type</name>\r\n

in the JDBC URL\r\n\r\n    <property>\r\n        <name>gateway.database.connection.url</name>\r\n        <value>jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase?user=smolnar&amp;password=cloudera</value>\r\n    </property>\r\n    \r\n**Test case 2:** username in the JDBC URL, password is saved as an alias\r\n```\r\n$ bin/knoxcli.sh create-alias gateway_database_password --value cloudera\r\ngateway_database_password has been successfully created.\r\n```\r\n```\r\n    <property>\r\n

password are saved as aliases (password was already saved, see Test case 2)\r\n ```\r\n$ bin/knoxcli.sh create-alias gateway_database_user --value smolnar\r\ngateway_database_user has been

</property>\r\n ``` \r\nConfirmed that all tokens were created successfully:\r\n```\r\nmydatabase=> select * from knox_tokens kt, knox_token_metadata meta where kt.token_id = meta.token_id;\r\n               token_id               |  issue_time   |  expiration   | max_lifetime  |               token_id               | md_name  |                                     md_value
