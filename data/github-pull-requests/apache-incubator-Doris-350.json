Proposed changes \r\n\r\nThe Repeat Node will change the data partition of fragment\r\n  when the origin data partition of fragment is HashPartition.\r\nThe Repeat Node will generate some new rows.\r\nThe distribution of these new rows is completely inconsistent with the original data distribution,\r\n  their distribution is RANDOM.\r\n\r\nIf the data distribution is not corrected,\r\n  an error will occur when the agg node determines whether to perform colocate.\r\nWrong data distribution will cause the agg node to think that agg can be colocated,\r\n  leading to wrong results.\r\nFor example, the following query can not be colocated although the distributed column of table is k1:\r\n```\r\nSELECT k1, k2, SUM( k3 )\r\nFROM table\r\nGROUP BY GROUPING SETS ( (k1, k2), (k1), (k2), ( ) )\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help!

bug/feature there in detail\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nAt present, `in memory table` will always occupy part of the page cache even if this `in memory table` has not been accessed for a long time, causing a waste of cache resources.\r\n\r\nLater, we can consider that the page of `in memory table` can be cached for a longer period of time instead of permanent cache, such as increasing the timestamp or weight.","created_at":"2021-05-26T06:44:00Z","updated_at":"2021-05-27T14:05:42Z","closed_at":"2021-05-27T14:05:42Z","merged_at":"2021-05-27T14:05:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"434335471100f1bd030e778b276f673dea13e6e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965628,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/improvement","name":"kind/improvement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nStep 1 of #5902 \r\nThis CL mainly changes:\r\n\r\n1. Support setting tags for BE nodes:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    alter system add backend \"1272:9050, 1212:9050\" properties(\"tag.location\": \"zoneA\");\r\n    alter system modify backend \"1272:9050, 1212:9050\" set (\"tag.location\": \"zoneB\");\r\n    ```\r\n    And for compatibility, all BE nodes will be set a \"default\" tag: \"tag.location\": \"default\".\r\n\r\n2. Create a new class `ReplicaAllocation` to replace the previous `replication_num`.\r\n\r\n    `ReplicaAllocation` represents the allocation of the replicas of a tablet. It contains a map from \r\n    Tag to number of replicas.\r\n    For example, if user set a table's replication num to 3, it will be converted to a ReplicaAllocation\r\n    like: \"tag.location.default\" : \"3\", which means the tablet will have 3 replicas and all of them will be\r\n    allocated in BE nodes with tag \"default\";\r\n\r\n3. Support create table with replication allocation:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    CREATE TABLE example_db.table_hash\r\n    (\r\n    k1 TINYINT\r\n    )\r\n    DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(k1) BUCKETS 32\r\n    PROPERTIES (\r\n        \"replication_allocation\"=\"tag.location.zone1:1, tag.location.zone1:2\"\r\n    );\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n    Also support set replica allocation for dynamic tables, and modify replica allocation at runtime.\r\n\r\n    For compatibility, user can still set \"replication_num\" = \"3\", and it will be automatically converted to:\r\n    \"tag.location.default\" = \"3\".\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nTablet has 5 metrics to record read/write statistic data. \r\nIntCounter* query_scan_bytes;\r\nIntCounter* query_scan_rows;\r\nIntCounter* query_scan_count;\r\nIntCounter* flush_bytes;\r\nIntCounter* flush_count;\r\n\r\nIt is meaningful to get these read/write data to find zero-read/write or hot-read/write table and partition. But in these metrics, it has tablet id information, but no table id/partition id information. Therefore this PR add table id/partition id for these 5 metrics. On the other side, there are maybe hundred thousands of tablet. It is difficult to get these metrics directly by http interface. There this patch provide a aggregate http interface. It can aggregate metric data according to metric label.\r\n\r\nIt is diffcult to write some unit tests to test this patch. Therefore, it is only be tested in offline running system.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\nhttp://localshot:8040/metrics?type=aggregate&entity_type=tablet&aggregate_label=table_id\r\n\r\ntype: json/prometheus/aggregate\r\nentity_type: tablet/server\r\naggregate_lable: aggregate metric by  which metric label \r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\n`[{\"11097\":[{\"flush_bytes\":\"0\"},{\"flush_count\":\"0\"},{\"query_scan_bytes\":\"0\"},{\"query_scan_count\":\"0\"},{\"query_scan_rows\":\"0\"}]},{\"11098\":[{\"flush_bytes\":\"0\"},{\"flush_count\":\"0\"},{\"query_scan_bytes\":\"0\"},{\"query_scan_count\":\"0\"},{\"query_scan_rows\":\"0\"}]},{\"11099\":[{\"flush_bytes\":\"0\"},{\"flush_count\":\"0\"},{\"query_scan_bytes\":\"0\"},{\"query_scan_count\":\"0\"},{\"query_scan_rows\":\"0\"}]}]`\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nRemoved some useless code that caused lock conflicts in ThreadResourceMgr of be.\r\n\r\nset_thread_available_cb() in ThreadResourceMgr has never been called, and _thread_available_fn is always NULL.\r\nBut every time the quota is updated, the thread pool is traversed to execute the _thread_available_fn, that is useless and may cause a lot of lock conflicts.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThe cause of the problem is that after query cancel, OlapScanNode::transfer_thread still continues to schedule OlapScanNode::scanner_thread until all tasks are scheduled.\r\n\r\nAlthough each task does not scan data and exits quickly, it still consumes a lot of resources.\r\n(Guess)This may be the cause of the BUG (#5767) causing the I/O to be full.\r\n\r\nSo after query cancel, immediately exit the scheduling loop in transfer_thread, and after waiting for the end of all scanner_threads, transfer_thread will also exit.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on (Fix #5767) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-07T12:30:17Z","updated_at":"2021-05-19T01:26:58Z","closed_at":"2021-05-19T01:26:58Z","merged_at":"2021-05-19T01:26:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"5748241dabc4777fdbe58e12c047e99fa02ab7ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965626,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/fix","name":"kind/fix","color":"e11d21","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIn the previous code, the routine load task did not catch the exception of opening the transaction.\r\nAs a result, although the task cannot be executed,\r\nno exceptions can

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nFix the replay error in stream load manager\r\n\r\n    The previous replay logic does not record the size of the map, which eventually resulted in EOF when reading the log.\r\n    This pr replaces the replay logic directly with json.\r\n\r\n    At the same time, the replay logic of image is supplemented.\r\n    The pr ensure that the attributes 'lastStreamLoadTime' of backend can be correctly recorded in the image.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fixed #5729) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-28T06:36:03Z","updated_at":"2021-05-05T02:18:51Z","closed_at":"2021-05-05T02:18:51Z","merged_at":"2021-05-05T02:18:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"eb1fdd019dca1b63e18d95bb858fb42322813208","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965626,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/fix","name":"kind/fix","color":"e11d21","default":false,"description":"Categorizes
