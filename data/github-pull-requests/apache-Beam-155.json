I would say this test relies on the BQ implementation detail that is able to import {'number': '1'} json as numeric. This fixes the test. Another possible fix of the test is to parse the bytes into actual numbers.\r\n\r\nr: @chamikaramj \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Updated pipeline_fragment to not prune newly added TestStream\r\ntransforms.\r\n2. Updated pipeline_instrument to support streaming pipeline and prune\r\ntransforms that don't contribute to the desired outputs.\r\n3. Updated ipython version upperbound to <8. We are targeting ipython >\r\n7.3 for the introduction of cell magic `%pip`. Note `%pip` has different\r\nbehavior than `!pip` because the previous one guaranteees the\r\ninstallation in the kernel not arbitrary environment the notebook is\r\nrunning in.\r\n4. Updated the README for Interactive Beam. The main change is\r\nrecommending using Jupyterlab over old Jupyter notebook and setup\r\ninstructions such as setting virtual env through Python3 venv module, installing\r\nnew labextensions over nbextensions and install extra dependencies.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

replaces the current implementation of a custom output stream wrapped by standard PrintStream, removing a possible deadlock between the PrintStream and handler.  The\r\ndeadlock can occur if something beneath the handler lock attempts to use System.err, reversing\r\nthe normal locking order.\r\n\r\nBy using PrintStream we can use a StringBuffer instead of a ByteBuffer, which also avoids extra encoding and decoding between byte arrays and Strings.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

was using `numpy.random.RandomState` during generation of Synthetic input, which, starting from NumPy 1.17, is considered as a legacy generator. This caused the slowdown on Python 3. The solution is using `random` module instead of Numpy on Python 3, and keep using Numpy on Python 2 until we deprecate Python 2 support.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

adds support for reading data from BigQuery using FastAvro in the new BigQuery source transform: `_ReadFromBigQuery`.\r\n\r\nThis creates a few subtle changes in the way that data is returned by BigQuery. These changes are the following:\r\n\r\n- All the time-specific data types in BigQuery (`DATE`, `DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP`) are converted into Python-specific types (`datetime.date`, `datetime.datetime`, `datetime.datetime`).\r\n  - This is different from `BigQuerySource`, where we export JSON data, and all of these datatypes are returned as strings.\r\n\r\n- The BigQuery `BYTES` type is returned as Python `bytes`.\r\n  - This is different from `BigQuerySource`, where we export JSON data. For JSON, BigQuery (and beam's BigQuerySource) returns base64-encoded bytes.\r\n\r\nNote that in tests, the behavior of BigQuerySource **remains the same**, while _ReadFromBigQuery has different behavior.\r\n\r\nThis transform does not need to honor backwards compatibility, as it is a new transform, and **it will not replace** BigQuerySource automatically. Nonetheless, we should definitely note the subtle API differences for it.\r\n\r\nr: @chamikaramj @tvalentyn @kamilwu \r\n\r\ncc: @mwalenia \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

@alexvanboxel I believe this PR will fix the issues you've both had with logical types.\r\n\r\nAfter some thought, I think we're better off storing the logical type value in the Row object. It potentially makes SchemaCoder a tiny bit slower, but unlikely this is noticeable. One bonus: it means that storage for OneOf types is far more memory efficient, as we no longer need to store the entire

implemented solution consists in an extension of the FileSystem classes for S3, that allows filtering of the matched objects. The filter consists in a mod hash function of the filename. \r\n\r\nThis mechanism is exploited by a parallel partitioned read of the files in the bucket, realised in the AvroIO and FileIO classes by means of the new hint . withHintPartitionInto(int) \r\n\r\nThe net effect is that a controlled number of tasks is spawn to different executors, each having a different partition number; each executor reads the entire list of files in the bucket, but matches only those files whose modhash matches the partition number. \r\n\r\nIn this way, all the executors in the cluster read in parallel.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

order to properly type some of the complexities around the `filesystem` API I had to address 2 main problems:\r\n\r\n- properly type `CompressedFile`\r\n  - add `Compressor` and `Decompressor` protocols\r\n  - make it a `BinaryIO` subclass.  this is necessary to guarantee that all the file-like things that are floating around these modules actually present the same interface.  unfortunately, `BinaryIO` is not a protocol, so it must be subclassed.  this required a few breaking changes:\r\n    - `writeable` renamed to `writable`\r\n    - `closed` method changed to a property\r\n    - `seekable` property changed a method\r\n    - `read` arg changed name\r\n    - `write` arg changed name\r\n-  add  a new `create_buffered()` classmethod to `DownloaderStream` and `UploaderStream`\r\n   - simplifies the creation of buffered wrappers to the classes\r\n   - this was motivated primarily by the desire to consolidate this pattern into one place so that I could handle the unfortunate need to `cast` these types to `BinaryIO`.   see notes on `DownloaderStream.create_buffered()` for why this was necessary.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nThis PR makes one significant runtime change that must be vetted.\r\n\r\n`s3io.S3IO.open()` originally created a buffered `DownloaderStream` like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n      return io.BufferedReader(\r\n          DownloaderStream(downloader, mode=mode), \r\n          buffer_size=read_buffer_size)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll other IO clients pass `read_buffer_size` to `DownloaderStream`, like this example from `gcsio`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n      return io.BufferedReader(\r\n          DownloaderStream(downloader, read_buffer_size=read_buffer_size, mode=mode),\r\n          buffer_size=read_buffer_size)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this PR I standardized on the latter behavior in order to simplify `create_buffered`, but I don't know whether this difference in `s3io` was intentional or not, or what the impact of changing it would be. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Added include_window_info and visualize_data as **kwargs passed into\r\n   `show`.\r\n2. Updated javascripts to make the data visualization smooth and\r\n   resilient to DOM changes. Now datatable is loaded dynamically without\r\n   flickering nor changing of user's page/search state; javascripts also\r\n   work when refreshing the browser.\r\n3. Resolved the jQuery+Datatable loading issue by forcing chained\r\n   loading. Any customized javascripts relying on jQuery should only use\r\n   `window.jquery341`. Always carry out a check for `window.jquery341`.\r\n   Run javascripts in the last onload of the jQuery loading chain if\r\n   `window.jquery341` is not available.\r\n4. All HTML imports are chained at onload of webcomponents (if HTML import\r\n   is not supported) or plainly imported (if HTML import supported) in a\r\n   single place in document.head. This makes HTML import resilient to\r\n   DOM changes caused by normal notebook usages.\r\n5. Updated some logging statements.\r\n6. Added `show_graph` API to render DAG of a pipeline. `pipeline.run`\r\n   does not render DAG now.\r\n\r\nChange-Id: Id2ca548860fb2d30e1557a35e7b14d2e61b5f1a4\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
