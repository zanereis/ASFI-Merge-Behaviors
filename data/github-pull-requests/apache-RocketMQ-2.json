-->\r\nI changed the key of the requestTable in the AllocateMappedFileService class from the FilePath to the FileName(this must be the only one), and then added a getCachedMappedFilePath method to provide to the MultiPathMappedFileQueue to check whether the MappedFile of a specified offset MappedFile create request has been submitted, and if so, obtain the cached FilePath, otherwise a new path is generated based on the previous rules.\r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n<!-- In order to ensure the code quality of Apache RocketMQ, we expect every pull request to have undergone thorough testing. -->\r\nI make a unit test to recurrence this case in testUniqueNextNextMappedFile().\r\n\r\nIn the previous implementation, the results obtained were as shown in the picture below,

Description\r\n\r\n在一些异常场景，可以模拟对ha端口的探活测试，由于conn.start会马上启动线程，在足够快失败的场景，会先执行removeConnection动作，而后再执行addConnection动作，最终造成connection泄漏，滞留 HaService 的connectionList里面，累积造成内存溢出风险。\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Did

encoding/decoding, and statistics.\r\n\r\nWe found that removing the codec thread pool and directly assigning these computational tasks to the NIO selector threads results in performance improvement.\r\n\r\nSince these tasks do not involve IO operations, they will not block the NIO selector threads.\r\n\r\nOur stress test results show that removing the codec thread pool can achieve higher TPS (5% increase) and also reduce CPU usage (4% reduction).\r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This

Consolidate several parameters related to double-write CQ, now only retaining storeType and rocksdbCQWriteEnable, simplifying the configuration process.\r\n2. Add configuration support for RocksDB CompressionType, while maintaining the default configuration unchanged.\r\n3. Modifiy the implementation of checkRocksdbCqWriteProgress utility class, add asynchronous calling method to prevent long check times from blocking the admin thread.\r\n\r\n描述：\r\n1. 将几个和双写cq相关的参数进行了合并，目前只保留storeType和rocksdbCQWriteEnable，简化了配置流程\r\n2. 增加了Rocksdb CompressionType的配置，默认配置不变\r\n3. 修改了checkRocksdbCqWriteProgress 工具类实现，增加异步调用的方式，防止check时间太久阻塞admin线程\r\n\r\n<!-- Write a

Delay the creation of the ProducerAccumulator until startup. Since instanceName will change at startup, and unitName should already be set at this time.\r\n2. Due to delaying the ProducerAccumulator to create, in order to allow users to set the parameters of batchMaxDelayMs, batchMaxbytes, and totaled BatchMaxbytes in the Producer Accumulator before executing the start method (Because I am worried that some users may set these parameters before executing start), three properties have been added to the DefaultMQProducer. After the ProducerAccumulator is initialized, it is assigned to the ProducerAccumulator.\r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to ensure the code quality of Apache RocketMQ, we expect every pull request to have undergone thorough testing. -->\r\nI have tested locally and confirmed that it will not be sent to other RocketMQ clusters, and the parameter settings can take effect.\r\n<img width=\"1246\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6443b84c-ab87-4b57-8adf-01af77272ea3\">\r\n<img width=\"1284\" alt=\"image\"

Key improvements include:\r\n\r\n- **Immutable Fields**: Marked `coldAcc` and `createTimeMillis` as `final` to signify that they should not change after initialization.\r\n- **Consistent Naming**: Renamed variables for better readability and consistency (e.g., `lastColdReadTimeMills` to `lastColdReadTimeMillis`).\r\n- **Removed Unused Setters**: Eliminated the setter for `coldAcc` to avoid changing the reference after construction, promoting safer usage.\r\n- **Primitive Types**: Changed the timestamp fields from `Long` objects to `long` primitives for performance improvements.\r\n- **Simplified Constructor**: Initialized timestamps directly within the constructor for clarity.\r\n\r\nThese changes improve the code's readability, maintainability, and performance.\r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n\r\nTo ensure the code quality and functionality of the `AccAndTimeStamp` class, the following testing steps were taken:\r\n\r\n1. **Unit Testing**: \r\n   - Created unit tests using JUnit to validate the behavior of the `AccAndTimeStamp` class, checking the correctness of getter methods and the initialization of timestamp values.\r\n   - Verified that the atomic operations on `coldAcc` function as expected using assertions to ensure the integrity of operations like `incrementAndGet()`.\r\n\r\n2. **Integration Testing**: \r\n   - Conducted integration tests within the larger context of the Apache RocketMQ application to ensure that the optimized class integrates smoothly with other components.\r\n   - Checked for potential concurrency issues by simulating multiple threads accessing and modifying `coldAcc`.\r\n\r\n3. **Manual Testing**:\r\n   - Performed manual tests to confirm that the class behaves correctly under different scenarios, including edge cases for the timestamp values.\r\n\r\nThese tests confirmed that the optimizations did not introduce any regressions and that the class behaves as intended.\r\nKindly assign me this

you!!","created_at":"2024-10-08T11:52:03Z","updated_at":"2024-10-09T06:02:25Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"85c9e8999afe9504a830a3e30963e2da9e1f1d22","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/8793/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/8793/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/8793/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/1cb17790cebfec3582d31269846da6994541d332","head":{"label":"stutimi:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"1cb17790cebfec3582d31269846da6994541d332","user":{"login":"stutimi","id":153292796,"node_id":"U_kgDOCSMP_A","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153292796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi","html_url":"https://github.com/stutimi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":869491959,"node_id":"R_kgDOM9Nk9w","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"stutimi/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stutimi","id":153292796,"node_id":"U_kgDOCSMP_A","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153292796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi","html_url":"https://github.com/stutimi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stutimi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stutimi/rocketmq","description":"Apache
