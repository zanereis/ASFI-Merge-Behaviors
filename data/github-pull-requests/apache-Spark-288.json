The way this executed-plan-leaf-to-logical-source attribution works is as follows. With V1 sources, there was no way to identify which execution plan leaves were generated by a streaming source. So did a best-effort attempt to match logical and execution plan leaves when the number of leaves were same. In cases where the number of leaves is different, we just give up and report zero rates. An example where this may happen is as follows.\r\n\r\n```\r\nval cachedStaticDF = someStaticDF.union(anotherStaticDF).cache()\r\nval streamingInputDF = ...\r\n\r\nval query = streamingInputDF.join(cachedStaticDF).writeStream....\r\n```\r\nIn this case, the `cachedStaticDF` has multiple logical leaves, but in the trigger's execution plan it only has leaf because a cached subplan is represented as a single InMemoryTableScanExec leaf. This leads to a mismatch in the number of leaves causing the input rates to be computed as zero. \r\n\r\nWith DataSourceV2, all inputs are represented in the executed plan using `DataSourceV2ScanExec`, each of which has a reference to the associated logical `DataSource` and `DataSourceReader`. So its easy to associate the metrics to the original streaming sources.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the solution is as follows. If all the streaming sources in a streaming query as v2 sources, then use a new code path where the execution-metrics-to-source mapping is done directly. Otherwise we fall back to existing mapping logic.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n- New unit tests using V2 memory source\r\n- Existing unit tests using V1 source\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-23T06:23:52Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T19:25:58Z","closed_at":"2018-04-25T19:25:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e190e6718a81a9ab8d9c9ac074d46531b3fa37e4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21126/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21126/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21126/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a56707f18989c76582c1e5238f2a80bd8a13b2a0","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-24050","ref":"SPARK-24050","sha":"a56707f18989c76582c1e5238f2a80bd8a13b2a0","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

that is a subset of [`TypedImperativeAggregation`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/76b8b840ddc951ee6203f9cccd2c2b9671c1b5e8/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/aggregate/interfaces.scala#L473) (for example, `collect_set`, `collect_list`, `percentile`, etc.). \r\n - Query running in `update}` mode\r\n - After the shuffle, a partition has exactly 128 records. \r\n\r\nThis causes StateStore.commit to be called twice. See the [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23004) for a more detailed explanation. The solution is to use `NextIterator` or `CompletionIterator`, each of which has a flag to prevent the \"onCompletion\" task from being called more than once. In this PR, I chose to implement using `NextIterator`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit test that I have confirm will fail without the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFrom #20933, we can see that during File data source V2 migration,  falling back to V1 implementation is necessary in following cases:\r\n1. File datasource V2 might be implemented partially during migration.\r\n  E.g. if `ReadSupport` is implemented while `WriteSupport` is not,\r\n  write path should fall back to V1 implementation.\r\n2. File datasource V2 implementations cause regression.\r\n3. Catalog support is required, which is still under development for data source V2.\r\n\r\nThis pr is to create a base class FileDataSourceV2 and resolve the falling back problems. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis updates the DataSourceV2 API to use InternalRow instead of Row for the default case with no scan mix-ins.\r\n\r\nSupport for readers that produce Row is added through SupportsDeprecatedScanRow, which matches the previous API.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere's a period of time when an accumulator has been garbage collected, but hasn't been removed from AccumulatorContext.originals by ContextCleaner. When an update is received for such accumulator it will throw an exception and kill the whole job. This can happen when a stage completes, but there're still running tasks from other attempts, speculation etc. Since AccumulatorContext.get() returns an option we can just return None in such case.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

JIRA description\r\n\r\nThe problem we are solving is the case where you have two big tables partitioned by X column, but also sorted within partitions by Y column and you need to calculate an expensive function on the joined rows, which reduces the number of output rows (e.g. condition based on a spatial distance calculation). But you could theoretically reduce the number of joined rows for which the calculation itself is performed by using a range condition on the Y column. Something like this:\r\n\r\n`... WHERE t1.X = t2.X AND t1.Y BETWEEN t2.Y - d AND t2.Y + d AND <function calculation...>`\r\n\r\nHowever, during a sort-merge join with this range condition specified, Spark will first cross-join all the rows with the same X value and only then will it try to apply the range condition and any function calculations. This happens because, inside the generated sort-merge join (SMJ) code, these extra conditions are put in the same block with the function being calculated and there is no way to evaluate these conditions before reading all the rows to be checked into memory (into an `ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray`). If the two tables have a large number of rows per X, this can result in a huge number of calculations and a huge number of rows in executor memory, which can be unfeasible. \r\n\r\nWe therefore propose a change to the sort-merge join so that, when these extra conditions are specified, a queue is used instead of the `ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray` class. This queue is then used as a moving window through the values from the right relation as the left row changes. You could call this a combination of an equi-join and a theta join; in literature it is sometimes called an “epsilon join”. We call it a \"sort-merge inner range join\".\r\n\r\nThis design uses much less memory (not all rows with the same values of X need to be loaded into memory at once) and requires a much lower number of comparisons (the validity of this statement depends on the actual data and conditions used). \r\n\r\nThe optimization should be triggered automatically when an equi-join expression is present AND lower and upper range conditions on a secondary column are specified. If the tables aren't sorted by both columns, appropriate sorts should be added.\r\n\r\nTo limit the impact of this change we also propose adding a new parameter (tentatively named `spark.sql.join.smj.useInnerRangeOptimization`) which could be used to switch off the optimization entirely.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe main changes are made to these classes:\r\n\r\n`ExtractEquiJoinKeys` – a pattern that needs to be extended to be able to recognize the case where a simple range condition with lower and upper limits is used on a secondary column (a column not included in the equi-join condition). The pattern also needs to extract the information later required for code generation etc.\r\n\r\n`ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray` – changed so that it can function as a queue too. The rows need to be removed and added to/from the structure as the left key (X) changes, or the left secondary value (Y) changes, so the structure needs to be a queue. The class is no longer \"append only\", but I didn't want to change too many things.\r\n\r\n`JoinSelection` – a strategy that uses `ExtractEquiJoinKeys` and needs to be aware of the extracted range conditions\r\n\r\n`SortMergeJoinExec` – the main implementation of the optimization. Needs to support two code paths: \r\n    • when whole-stage code generation is turned off (method `doExecute`, which uses `sortMergeJoinInnerRangeScanner`) \r\n    • when whole-stage code generation is turned on (methods `doProduce` and `genScanner`)\r\n`SortMergeJoinInnerRangeScanner` – implements the SMJ with inner-range optimization in the case when whole-stage codegen is turned off\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests (`InnerRangeSuite.scala`, `JoinSuite.scala`, `ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArraySuite`)\r\n\r\nPerformance tests in `JoinBenchmark`. The tests show 8x improvement over non-optimized code. Although, it should be noted that the results depend on the exact range conditions and the calculations performed on each matched row. \r\nIn our case, we were not able to cross-match two rather large datasets (1.2 billion rows x 800 million rows) without this optimization. With the optimization, the cross-match finishes in less than 2

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the from_json function support StructType or ArrayType as the root type. The PR allows to specify MapType(StringType, DataType) as the root type additionally to mentioned types. For example:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\nval schema = MapType(StringType, IntegerType)\r\nval in = Seq(\"\"\"{\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\"\"\").toDS()\r\nin.select(from_json($\"value\", schema, Map[String, String]())).collect()\r\n```\r\n```\r\nres1: Array[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([Map(a -> 1, b -> 2, c -> 3)])\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was checked by new tests for the map type with integer type and struct type as value types. Also roundtrip tests like from_json(to_json) and to_json(from_json) for MapType are

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove duplicated dependency checking logics and also print out skipped tests from unittests. \r\n\r\nFor example, as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSkipped tests in pyspark.sql.tests with pypy:\r\n    test_createDataFrame_column_name_encoding (pyspark.sql.tests.ArrowTests) ... skipped 'Pandas >= 0.19.2 must be installed; however, it was not found.'\r\n    test_createDataFrame_does_not_modify_input (pyspark.sql.tests.ArrowTests) ... skipped 'Pandas >= 0.19.2 must be installed; however, it was not found.'\r\n...\r\n\r\nSkipped tests in pyspark.sql.tests with python3:\r\n    test_createDataFrame_column_name_encoding (pyspark.sql.tests.ArrowTests) ... skipped 'PyArrow >= 0.8.0 must be installed; however, it was not found.'\r\n    test_createDataFrame_does_not_modify_input (pyspark.sql.tests.ArrowTests) ... skipped 'PyArrow >= 0.8.0 must be installed; however, it was not found.'\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, it's not printed out in the console. I think we should better print out skipped tests in the console.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested. Also, fortunately, Jenkins has good environment to test the skipped output.","created_at":"2018-04-19T15:01:34Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T12:44:50Z","closed_at":"2018-04-26T22:16:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bc6f5f1b45b48e8fd89cb7c644aa2591eecd4fc1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21107/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21107/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21107/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3dd74a00c293030df57b126163de1cda47a2b7fe","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:skipped-tests-print","ref":"skipped-tests-print","sha":"3dd74a00c293030df57b126163de1cda47a2b7fe","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Spark SQL, we usually reuse the `UnsafeRow` instance and need to copy the data when a place buffers non-serialized objects.\r\n\r\nShuffle may buffer objects if we don't make it to the bypass merge shuffle or unsafe shuffle.\r\n\r\n`ShuffleExchangeExec.needToCopyObjectsBeforeShuffle` misses the case that, if `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` is large enough, we could fail to run unsafe shuffle and go with the non-serialized shuffle.\r\n\r\nThis bug is very hard to hit since users wouldn't set such a large number of partitions(16 million) for Spark SQL exchange.\r\n\r\nTODO: test\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\ntodo.","created_at":"2018-04-18T14:45:16Z","updated_at":"2018-04-19T15:58:55Z","closed_at":"2018-04-19T15:58:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2754e64d19c3ddd4d348d48d226842281cd3b7e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21101/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21101/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21101/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/40b2c5ca196427c1391e4abe60cb89dc36cbea77","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:shuffle","ref":"shuffle","sha":"40b2c5ca196427c1391e4abe60cb89dc36cbea77","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen creating stages for jobs, we need to find a rdd's (except the final rdd) immediate parent ShuffleDependencies by method `getShuffleDependencies()` for at least 2 times (first in\r\n`getMissingAncestorShuffleDependencies()`, and second in `getOrCreateParentStages()`).\r\n\r\nSo, we can cache the result at the fist time we call `getShuffleDependencies()`.\r\nThis is helpful for cutting time consuming when there's many `NarrowDependencies` between the rdd and its immediate parent `ShuffleDependencies` or if the rdd has a number of immediate parent `ShuffleDependencies` .\r\n \r\nThere's an exception for checkpointed rdd. If a rdd is checkpointed, it's immediate parent `ShuffleDependencies` should adjust to empty.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTODO.\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-18T10:42:02Z","updated_at":"2018-06-12T03:11:01Z","closed_at":"2018-06-12T03:11:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"34591090c77d61604f90ee8e317771ab1513ff3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21096/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21096/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21096/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/59fb931135b7bc8fc1f516c39015f7412ae25208","head":{"label":"Ngone51:SPARK-24011","ref":"SPARK-24011","sha":"59fb931135b7bc8fc1f516c39015f7412ae25208","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new config `spark.kubernetes.driver/executor.volumes` taking a values of the format documented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15-mk7UnOYNTXoF6EKaVlelWYc9DTrTXrYoodwDuAwY4/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\nThe use case is to enable short-circuit writes to distributed storage on k8s. The Alluxio File System uses domain sockets to enable short-circuit writes from the client to worker memory when co-located on the same host machine. A directory, lets say /tmp/domain on the host, is mounted on the Alluxio worker container as well as the Alluxio client ( = Spark executor) container. The worker creates a domain socket /tmp/domain/d and if the client container mounts the same directory, it can write directly to the Alluxio worker w/o passing through network stack. The end result is faster data access when data is local.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual testing on a k8s v1.8 cluster. Unit tests added to `Driver/ExecutorPodFactorySuite`.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR implements the possibility of the user to override the maximum number of buckets when saving to a table. \r\nCurrently the limit is a hard-coded 100k, which might be insufficient for large workloads.\r\nA new configuration entry is proposed: `spark.sql.bucketing.maxBuckets`, which defaults to the previous 100k.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests in the following spark.sql test suites:\r\n\r\n- CreateTableAsSelectSuite\r\n- BucketedWriteSuite\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-17T16:47:29Z","updated_at":"2018-09-02T22:31:03Z","closed_at":"2018-08-28T17:37:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9362084a4b7921ff952ee1582c979e359d30cba3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21087/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21087/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21087/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ebd926530c1d8b2f515a4a233f5963eafc17e460","head":{"label":"ferdonline:enh/configurable_bucket_limit","ref":"enh/configurable_bucket_limit","sha":"ebd926530c1d8b2f515a4a233f5963eafc17e460","user":{"login":"ferdonline","id":915100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTEwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/915100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline","html_url":"https://github.com/ferdonline","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105772951,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU3NzI5NTE=","name":"spark","full_name":"ferdonline/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ferdonline","id":915100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTEwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/915100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline","html_url":"https://github.com/ferdonline","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdonline/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ferdonline/spark","description":"Mirror

SparkPlan.prepare() could be called in different threads (BroadcastExchange will call it in a thread pool). Thus, we could serialize the same Parquet filter at the same time. This is not easily reproduced. The fix is to avoid serializing these Parquet filters in the driver. This PR is to avoid serializing these Parquet filters by moving the parquet filter generation from the driver to executors. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nHaving two queries one is a 1000-line SQL query and a 3000-line SQL query. Need to run at least one hour with a heavy write workload to reproduce once.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSparkContext submitted a map stage from `submitMapStage` to `DAGScheduler`,\r\n`markMapStageJobAsFinished` is called only in (https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala#L933 and https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala#L1314);\r\n\r\nBut think about below scenario:\r\n1. stage0 and stage1 are all `ShuffleMapStage` and stage1 depends on stage0;\r\n2. We submit stage1 by `submitMapStage`;\r\n3. When stage 1 running, `FetchFailed` happened, stage0 and stage1 got resubmitted as stage0_1 and stage1_1;\r\n4. When stage0_1 running, speculated tasks in old stage1 come as succeeded, but stage1 is not inside `runningStages`. So even though all splits(including the speculated tasks) in stage1 succeeded, job listener in stage1 will not be called;\r\n5. stage0_1 finished, stage1_1 starts running. When `submitMissingTasks`, there is no missing tasks. But in current code, job listener is not triggered.\r\n\r\nWe should call the job listener for map stage in `5`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNot added yet.\r\n\r\nAuthor: jinxing <jinxing6042@126.com>\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe existing query constraints framework has 2 steps:\r\n1. propagate constraints bottom up.\r\n2. use constraints to infer additional filters for better data pruning.\r\n\r\nFor step 2, it mostly helps with Join, because we can connect the constraints from children to the join condition and infer powerful filters to prune the data of the join sides. e.g., the left side has constraints `a = 1`, the join condition is `left.a = right.a`, then we can infer `right.a = 1` to the right side and prune the right side a lot.\r\n\r\nHowever, the current logic of inferring filters from constraints for Join is pretty weak. It infers the filters from Join's constraints. Some joins like left semi/anti exclude output from right side and the right side constraints will be lost here.\r\n\r\nThis PR propose to check the left and right constraints individually, expand the constraints with join condition and add filters to children of join directly, instead of adding to the join condition.\r\n\r\nThis reverts https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20670 , covers https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20717 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20816\r\n\r\nThis is inspired by the original PRs and the tests are all from these PRs. Thanks to the authors @mgaido91 @maryannxue @KaiXinXiaoLei !\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew

Especially, (1) needs careful thinking w.r.t. how to pass rolling window data to python efficiently. (2) is a bit easier but does require more changes therefore I think it's better to leave it as a separate PR.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently we find the wider common type by comparing the two types from left to right, this can be a problem when you have two data types which don't have a common type but each can be promoted to StringType.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if you have a table with the schema:\r\n[c1: date, c2: string, c3: int]\r\n\r\nThe following succeeds:\r\nSELECT coalesce(c1, c2, c3) FROM table\r\n\r\nWhile the following produces an exception:\r\nSELECT coalesce(c1, c3, c2) FROM table\r\n\r\nThis is only a issue when the seq of dataTypes contains `StringType` and all the types can do string promotion.\r\n\r\nclose #19033\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd test in `TypeCoercionSuite`","created_at":"2018-04-15T15:27:12Z","updated_at":"2018-04-23T07:25:57Z","closed_at":"2018-04-19T13:25:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7052ddee738d7fc08167fbb3189fc437bc603b06","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21074/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21074/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21074/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ff514afd8adf817ee14a7504f0e9e8244c596ab6","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:typeCoercion","ref":"typeCoercion","sha":"ff514afd8adf817ee14a7504f0e9e8244c596ab6","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis updates Parquet to 1.10.0 and updates the vectorized path for buffer management changes. Parquet 1.10.0 uses ByteBufferInputStream instead of byte arrays in encoders. This allows Parquet to break allocations into smaller chunks that are better for garbage collection.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting Parquet tests. Running in production at Netflix for about 3 months.","created_at":"2018-04-13T21:05:57Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T04:31:15Z","closed_at":"2018-05-09T04:31:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3ed20856aeafce41b881155a998f346ea6787c29","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21070/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21070/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21070/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/95ecde09392ab4f2aab2f1165fb180c5466c26b4","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-23972-update-parquet-to-1.10.0","ref":"SPARK-23972-update-parquet-to-1.10.0","sha":"95ecde09392ab4f2aab2f1165fb180c5466c26b4","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change extends YARN resource allocation handling with blacklisting functionality.\r\nThis handles cases when node is messed up or misconfigured such that a container won't launch on it. Before this change backlisting only focused on task execution but this change introduces YarnAllocatorBlacklistTracker which tracks allocation failures per host (when enabled via \"spark.yarn.blacklist.executor.launch.blacklisting.enabled\"). \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n### With unit tests\r\n\r\nIncluding a new suite: YarnAllocatorBlacklistTrackerSuite.\r\n\r\n#### Manually\r\n\r\nIt was tested on a cluster by deleting the Spark jars on one of the node.\r\n \r\n#### Behaviour before these changes\r\n\r\nStarting Spark as:\r\n```\r\nspark2-shell --master yarn --deploy-mode client --num-executors 4  --conf spark.executor.memory=4g --conf \"spark.yarn.max.executor.failures=6\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nLog is:\r\n```\r\n18/04/12 06:49:36 INFO yarn.ApplicationMaster: Final app status: FAILED, exitCode: 11, (reason: Max number of executor failures (6) reached)\r\n18/04/12 06:49:39 INFO yarn.ApplicationMaster: Unregistering ApplicationMaster with FAILED (diag message: Max number of executor failures (6) reached)\r\n18/04/12 06:49:39 INFO impl.AMRMClientImpl: Waiting for application to be successfully unregistered.\r\n18/04/12 06:49:39 INFO yarn.ApplicationMaster: Deleting staging directory hdfs://apiros-1.gce.test.com:8020/user/systest/.sparkStaging/application_1523459048274_0016\r\n18/04/12 06:49:39 INFO util.ShutdownHookManager: Shutdown hook called\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Behaviour after these changes\r\n\r\nStarting Spark as:\r\n```\r\nspark2-shell --master yarn --deploy-mode client --num-executors 4  --conf spark.executor.memory=4g --conf \"spark.yarn.max.executor.failures=6\" --conf \"spark.yarn.blacklist.executor.launch.blacklisting.enabled=true\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the log is:\r\n```\r\n18/04/13 05:37:43 INFO yarn.YarnAllocator: Will request 1 executor container(s), each with 1 core(s) and 4505 MB memory (including 409 MB of overhead)\r\n18/04/13 05:37:43 INFO yarn.YarnAllocator: Submitted 1 unlocalized container requests.\r\n18/04/13 05:37:43 INFO yarn.YarnAllocator: Launching container container_1523459048274_0025_01_000008 on host apiros-4.gce.test.com for executor with ID 6\r\n18/04/13 05:37:43 INFO yarn.YarnAllocator: Received 1 containers from YARN, launching executors on 1 of them.\r\n18/04/13 05:37:43 INFO yarn.YarnAllocator: Completed container container_1523459048274_0025_01_000007 on host: apiros-4.gce.test.com (state: COMPLETE, exit status: 1)\r\n18/04/13 05:37:43 INFO yarn.YarnAllocatorBlacklistTracker: blacklisting host as YARN allocation failed: apiros-4.gce.test.com\r\n18/04/13 05:37:43 INFO yarn.YarnAllocatorBlacklistTracker: adding nodes to YARN application master's blacklist: List(apiros-4.gce.test.com)\r\n18/04/13 05:37:43 WARN yarn.YarnAllocator: Container marked as failed: container_1523459048274_0025_01_000007 on host: apiros-4.gce.test.com.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of `Spark driver` on Kubernetes is not resilient to node failures as it’s implemented as a `Pod`. In case of a node failure Kubernetes terminates the pods that were running on that node. Kubernetes doesn't reschedule these pods to any of the other nodes of the cluster.\r\nIf the `driver` is implemented as Kubernetes Job than it will be rescheduled to other node.\r\nWhen the driver is terminated its executors (that may run on other nodes) are terminated by Kubernetes with some delay by Kubernetes Garbage collection.\r\nThis can lead to concurrency issues where the re-spawned `driver` was trying to create new executors with same name as the executors being in the middle of being cleaned up by Kubernetes garbage collection.\r\nTo solve this issue the executor name must be made unique for each `driver` instance.\r\nFor example: \r\n`networkwordcount-1519301591265-usmj-exec-1`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch was tested manually.\r\nSubmitted a Spark application to a cluster with three node:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkubectl get jobs\r\nNAME                                    DESIRED   SUCCESSFUL   AGE\r\nnetworkwordcount-1519301591265-driver   1

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch has on SPARK-23807 as prerequisite; this PR initially includes it so it builds and tests independently.\r\n\r\n* Add source tree under `hadoop-cloud` which builds iff the `hadoop-3.1` profile is enabled.\r\n* Add a subclass of `HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol` , `org.apache.spark.internal.io.cloud.PathOutputCommitProtocol`, which uses the Hadoop 3.1 `PathOutputCommitterFactory` to create the committers.\r\n* Add a `org.apache.spark.internal.io.cloud.BindingParquetOutputCommitter` class which extends `ParquetOutputCommitter` to wire up Parquet output even when code requires the committer to be a `ParquetOutputCommitter`.\r\n\r\nIf the application configures the spark context to use the new committers, then jobs will switch to the factory mechanism and so pick up the configured committer for the destination filesystem, with FileOutputCommitter being the standard default. \r\nIf/when Spark switches to `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.output` output classes it would get the factory binding automatically, except for Parquet, whose committer subclassing always complicates things. A binding class will always be needed there.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAutomated tests in [cloud-examples](https://github.com/hortonworks-spark/cloud-integration/tree/master/cloud-examples) test the commit mechanism working with: CSV, ORC and Parquet output. \r\n\r\nTests include:\r\n\r\n* Copies of some of the tests in `org.apache.spark.sql.sources.HadoopFsRelationTest`, tests reworked to setup, probe and teardown with FileSystem instances, rather than the local FS direct.\r\n* Full funtional tests reading in public datasources, transforming and saving them using different committer options.\r\n* The Fault injection feature of Hadoop 3.1's S3A connector, which can simulate S3 listing inconsistency at a higher rate than would normally be seen; this will force eventual-consistency related bugs to surface.\r\n\r\nThe S3A committers take advantage of the fact that writing a file is always atomic, and save summary data as JSON in the `_SUCCESS` file created in jobs. The tests use this to verify the correct committer was used in the different tests.\r\n\r\nThe Hadoop 3/hive version check problem fails all the tests unless one of the following fixes is applied.\r\n* hadoop-3.x built locally with a false published version of 2.x (built with `-Ddeclared.hadoop.version=2.11` or similar)\r\n* spark built with a modified org.sparkproject.hive JAR.\r\n\r\nI've done both.","created_at":"2018-04-13T13:16:13Z","updated_at":"2019-06-24T16:49:43Z","closed_at":"2019-06-24T16:49:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"507792550d1eea0e85538a93d52b45baf6fc5910","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21066/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21066/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21066/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cb46f89aa6615d2b28edce6142c951300710c439","head":{"label":"steveloughran:cloud/SPARK-23977-pathoutputcommitters","ref":"cloud/SPARK-23977-pathoutputcommitters","sha":"cb46f89aa6615d2b28edce6142c951300710c439","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32387210,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM4NzIxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"steveloughran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR detects length overflow if total elements in inputs are not acceptable.\r\n\r\nFor example, when the three inputs has `0x7FFF_FF00`, `0x7FFF_FF00`, and `0xE00`, we should detect length overflow since we cannot allocate such a large structure on `byte[]`.\r\nOn the other hand, the current algorithm can allocate the result structure with `0x1000`-byte length due to integer sum overflow.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting UTs.\r\nIf we would create UTs, we need large heap (6-8GB). It may make test environment unstable.\r\nIf it is necessary to create UTs, I will create them.","created_at":"2018-04-13T12:06:32Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T05:28:00Z","closed_at":"2018-05-02T08:46:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c37e1f4fdf8083510c16e5bd7f45840cd573d422","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21064/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21064/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21064/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6ba94f3b6c4cc3e69e4916a1669e95ef71267a6a","head":{"label":"kiszk:SPARK-23976","ref":"SPARK-23976","sha":"6ba94f3b6c4cc3e69e4916a1669e95ef71267a6a","user":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45008789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTAwODc4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"kiszk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add `collect` to  a query executor as an action.\r\n\r\nSeems `collect` / `collect` with Arrow are not recognised via `QueryExecutionListener` as an action. For example, if we have a custom listener as below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\npackage org.apache.spark.sql\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.spark.internal.Logging\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.execution.QueryExecution\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.util.QueryExecutionListener\r\n\r\nclass TestQueryExecutionListener extends QueryExecutionListener with Logging {\r\n  override def onSuccess(funcName: String, qe: QueryExecution, durationNs: Long): Unit = {\r\n    logError(\"Look at me! I'm 'onSuccess'\")\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  override def onFailure(funcName: String, qe: QueryExecution, exception: Exception): Unit = { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand set `spark.sql.queryExecutionListeners` to `org.apache.spark.sql.TestQueryExecutionListener`\r\n\r\nOther operations in PySpark or Scala side seems fine:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> sql(\"SELECT * FROM range(1)\").show()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n18/04/09 17:02:04 ERROR TestQueryExecutionListener: Look at me! I'm 'onSuccess'\r\n+---+\r\n| id|\r\n+---+\r\n|  0|\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT * FROM range(1)\").collect()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n18/04/09 16:58:41 ERROR TestQueryExecutionListener: Look at me! I'm 'onSuccess'\r\nres1: Array[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([0])\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut ..\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> sql(\"SELECT * FROM range(1)\").collect()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n[Row(id=0)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled\", \"true\")\r\n>>> sql(\"SELECT * FROM range(1)\").toPandas()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n   id\r\n0   0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> sql(\"SELECT * FROM range(1)\").collect()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n18/04/09 16:57:58 ERROR TestQueryExecutionListener: Look at me! I'm 'onSuccess'\r\n[Row(id=0)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled\", \"true\")\r\n>>> sql(\"SELECT * FROM range(1)\").toPandas()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n18/04/09 17:53:26 ERROR TestQueryExecutionListener: Look at me! I'm 'onSuccess'\r\n   id\r\n0   0\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI have manually tested as described above and unit test was added.\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-13T03:39:37Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T12:44:51Z","closed_at":"2018-04-14T13:51:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d51a92d22db220c1cb704596f63f85df0d3c755a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21060/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21060/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21060/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4656724d27c208d794f99691cfbf93b4bb118d93","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:PR_TOOL_PICK_PR_21007_BRANCH-2.3","ref":"PR_TOOL_PICK_PR_21007_BRANCH-2.3","sha":"4656724d27c208d794f99691cfbf93b4bb118d93","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn dynamic allocation, there are cases that the `numExecutorsTarget` has reached `maxNumExecutors`, but for some reason (client.requestTotalExecutors didn't work as expected or throw exceptions due to RPC failure), the  method `addExecutors` always returns 0 without do `client.requestTotalExecutors`. And there are too many tasks to handle, `maxNeeded < numExecutorsTarget` is false, in `updateAndSyncNumExecutorsTarget` we always run into `addExecutors` with `numExecutorsTarget == maxNumExecutors`. Since numExecutorsTarget is hard to decrease, as a result, we are using only a few executors to handle the heavy tasks without dynamically increasing the number of executors.\r\n\r\nSince the semantics of `client.requestTotalExecutors` are requesting executors up to a number. And for Yarn, it finally set the `targetNumExecutors` in `YarnAllocator`. It won't be a problem that we call this method repeatedly.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2018-04-13T02:58:15Z","updated_at":"2018-04-13T09:27:53Z","closed_at":"2018-04-13T09:27:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"566357331498a0e93a7cf5c199865702d7ced5b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21059/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21059/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21059/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a7990db6238ce0a21f64492eaf15ec1b9c278e13","head":{"label":"da-liii:jira23974","ref":"jira23974","sha":"a7990db6238ce0a21f64492eaf15ec1b9c278e13","user":{"login":"da-liii","id":1267865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjc4NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1267865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii","html_url":"https://github.com/da-liii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":129335609,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjkzMzU2MDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"da-liii/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"da-liii","id":1267865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjc4NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1267865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii","html_url":"https://github.com/da-liii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da-liii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/da-liii/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe following functions are implemented and available in the `functions` object of SQL API:\r\n\r\n- time_based_uuid()\r\n- random_based_uuid()\r\n\r\nUUIDs are generated with help of [java-uuid-generator](https://github.com/cowtowncoder/java-uuid-generator).\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces a custom random-based UUID generator that previously was used in some parts of the code. In addition, it provides a new function for time-based UUIDs.\r\nFor backward compatibility, the new `random_based_uuid()` functions produces same UUID values for retries on the same data set. Thus, the new function is consistent with the legacy `uuid()` function.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests on the new functions as well as on SQL expressions implementing these functions.","created_at":"2018-04-12T16:25:07Z","updated_at":"2019-01-08T02:42:17Z","closed_at":"2019-01-08T02:42:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"326b3577166e71007016ddabcc59f10d6beaa1ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21055/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21055/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21055/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/77e65d8cfa07a5eca7890ffc12bbed917312a35f","head":{"label":"tashoyan:SPARK-23693","ref":"SPARK-23693","sha":"77e65d8cfa07a5eca7890ffc12bbed917312a35f","user":{"login":"tashoyan","id":17761745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzYxNzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17761745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan","html_url":"https://github.com/tashoyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"0b19122d434e39eb117ccc3174a0688c9c874d48","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

changes were proposed in this pull request? \r\n\r\nDuring evaluation of IN conditions, if the source data frame, is represented by a plan, that uses hive table with columns, which were previously analysed, and the plan has conditions for these fields, that cannot be satisfied (which leads us to an empty data frame), FilterEstimation.evaluateInSet method produces NumberFormatException and ClassCastException. \r\nIn order to fix this bug, method FilterEstimation.evaluateInSet at first checks, if distinct count is not zero, and also checks if colStat.min and colStat.max  are defined, and only in this case proceeds with the calculation. If at least one of the conditions is not satisfied, zero is returned. \r\n\r\n>How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIn order to test the PR two tests were implemented: one in FilterEstimationSuite, that tests the plan with the statistics that violates the conditions mentioned above,  and another one in StatisticsCollectionSuite, that test the whole process of analysis/optimisation of the query, that leads to the problems, mentioned in the first section.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCheckpoint files (offset log files, state store files) in Structured Streaming must be written atomically such that no partial files are generated (would break fault-tolerance guarantees). Currently, there are 3 locations which try to do this individually, and in some cases, incorrectly.\r\n\r\n1. HDFSOffsetMetadataLog - This uses a FileManager interface to use any implementation of `FileSystem` or `FileContext` APIs. It preferably loads `FileContext` implementation as FileContext of HDFS has atomic renames.\r\n1. HDFSBackedStateStore (aka in-memory state store)\r\n  - Writing a version.delta file - This uses FileSystem APIs only to perform a rename. This is incorrect as rename is not atomic in HDFS FileSystem implementation.\r\n  - Writing a snapshot file - Same as above.\r\n\r\n#### Current problems:\r\n1. State Store behavior is incorrect - HDFS FileSystem implementation does not have atomic rename.\r\n1. Inflexible - Some file systems provide mechanisms other than write-to-temp-file-and-rename for writing atomically and more efficiently. For example, with S3 you can write directly to the final file and it will be made visible only when the entire file is written and closed correctly. Any failure can be made to terminate the writing without making any partial files visible in S3. The current code does not abstract out this mechanism enough that it can be customized. \r\n\r\n#### Solution:\r\n\r\n1. Introduce a common interface that all 3 cases above can use to write checkpoint files atomically. \r\n2. This interface must provide the necessary interfaces that allow customization of the write-and-rename mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis PR does that by introducing the interface `CheckpointFileManager` and modifying `HDFSMetadataLog` and `HDFSBackedStateStore` to use the interface. Similar to earlier `FileManager`, there are implementations based on `FileSystem` and `FileContext` APIs, and the latter implementation is preferred to make it work correctly with HDFS.\r\n\r\nThe key method this interface has is `createAtomic(path, overwrite)` which returns a `CancellableFSDataOutputStream` that has the method `cancel()`. All users of this method need to either call `close()` to successfully write the file, or `cancel()` in case of an error.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests in `CheckpointFileManagerSuite` and slightly modified existing tests.\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-11T23:00:26Z","updated_at":"2023-02-08T02:04:53Z","closed_at":"2018-04-13T23:35:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"94289556639f77721b13b100cc4408dd275cc00c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21048/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21048/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21048/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c5b0c98257e39d6af2dd8f702b8cbc9f9e6fabe9","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-23966","ref":"SPARK-23966","sha":"c5b0c98257e39d6af2dd8f702b8cbc9f9e6fabe9","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTableReader would get disproportionately slower as the number of columns in the query increased.\r\n\r\nI fixed the way TableReader was looking up metadata for each column in the row. Previously, it had been looking up this data in linked lists, accessing each linked list by an index (column number). Now it looks up this data in arrays, where indexing by column number works better.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual testing\r\nAll sbt unit tests\r\npython sql

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nKafka partitions can be revoked when new consumers joined in the consumer group to rebalance the partitions. But current Spark Kafka connector code makes sure there's no partition revoking scenarios, so trying to get latest offset from revoked partitions will throw exceptions as JIRA mentioned.\r\n\r\nPartition revoking happens when new consumer joined the consumer group, which means different streaming apps are trying to use same group id. This is fundamentally not correct, different apps should use different consumer group. So instead of throwing an confused exception from Kafka, improve the exception message by identifying revoked partition and directly throw an meaningful exception when partition is revoked.\r\n\r\nBesides, this PR also fixes bugs in `DirectKafkaWordCount`, this example simply cannot be worked without the fix.\r\n\r\n```\r\n8/01/05 09:48:27 INFO internals.ConsumerCoordinator: Revoking previously assigned partitions [kssh-7, kssh-4, kssh-3, kssh-6, kssh-5, kssh-0, kssh-2, kssh-1] for group use_a_separate_group_id_for_each_stream\r\n18/01/05 09:48:27 INFO

the PR without UT

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new config `spark.kubernetes.executor.volumes` taking a values of the form  `hostPath:containerPath[:ro|rw][,...]`; where  `hostPath` is the path for the executor pod volume, `containerPath` is the mount path and `ro` is read-only mode.\r\n\r\nThe use case is to enable short-circuit writes to distributed storage on k8s. The Alluxio File System uses domain sockets to enable short-circuit writes from the client to worker memory when co-located on the same host machine. A directory, lets say /tmp/domain on the host, is mounted on the Alluxio worker container as well as the Alluxio client ( = Spark executor) container. The worker creates a domain socket /tmp/domain/d and if the client container mounts the same directory, it can write directly to the Alluxio worker w/o passing through network stack. The end result is faster data access when data is local.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual testing on a k8s v1.8 cluster. Unit tests added to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe PR adds the SQL function `cardinality`. The behavior of the function is based on Presto's one.\r\n\r\nThe function returns the length of the array or map stored in the column as `int` while the Presto version returns the value as `BigInt` (`long` in Spark). The discussions regarding the difference of return type are [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21031#issuecomment-381284638) and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis API change is inspired by the problems we meet when migrating streaming and file-based data sources to the data souce v2 API.\r\n\r\nFor the streaming side, we need a variant of the `DataReader/WriterFactory`(see [an example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PJYfb68s2AG7joRWbhrgpEWhrsPqbhyRwUVl9V1wPOE/edit#)). This brings a lot of trouble for scanning/writing optimized data format like `InternalRow`, `ColumnarBatch`, etc.\r\n\r\nThese special scanning/writing interfaces are defined like\r\n```\r\ninterface SupportsScanColumnarBatch {\r\n  List<DataReaderFactory<UnsafeRow>> createUnsafeRowReaderFactories();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis can't work with `ContinuousDataReaderFactory` at all, or we have to do runtime type cast and make the variant extends `DataReader/WriterFactory`. We have the same problem on the write path too.\r\n\r\nFor the file-based data source side, we have a problem with code duplication. Let's take ORC data source as an example. To support both unsafe row and columnar batch scan, we need something like\r\n```\r\nclass OrcUnsafeRowDataReader extends DataReader[UnsafeRow] {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass OrcColumnarBatchDataReader extends DataReader[ColumnarBatch] {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass OrcUnsafeRowFactory(...) extends DataReaderFactory[UnsafeRow] {\r\n  def createDataReader ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass OrcColumnarBatchFactory(...) extends DataReaderFactory[ColumnarBatch] {\r\n  def createDataReader ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass OrcDataSourceReader extends DataSourceReader {\r\n  def createUnsafeRowFactories = ... // logic to prepare the parameters and create factories\r\n\r\n  def createColumnarBatchFactories = ... // logic to prepare the parameters and create factories\r\n}\r\n```\r\nYou can see that we have duplicated logic for preparing parameters and defining the factory. After this change, we can simplify the code to\r\n```\r\nclass OrcReaderFactory(...) extends DataReaderFactory {\r\n  def createUnsafeRowReader ...\r\n\r\n  def createColumnarBatchReader ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass OrcDataSourceReader extends DataSourceReader {\r\n  def createReadFactories = ... // logic to prepare the parameters and create factories\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe proposed change is: remove the type parameter and embed the special scanning/writing format to the factory. e.g.\r\n```\r\ninterface DataReaderFactory {\r\n  DataFormat dataFormat;\r\n\r\n  default DataReader<Row> createRowDataReader() {\r\n    throw new IllegalStateException(\r\n      \"createRowDataReader must be implemented if the data format is ROW.\");\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  default DataReader<UnsafeRow> createUnsafeRowDataReader() {\r\n    throw new IllegalStateException(\r\n      \"createUnsafeRowDataReader must be implemented if the data format is UNSAFE_ROW.\");\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  default DataReader<ColumnarBatch> createColumnarBatchDataReader() {\r\n    throw new IllegalStateException(\r\n      \"createColumnarBatchDataReader must be implemented if the data format is COLUMNAR_BATCH.\");\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA potential benefit after this change: now it's up to the factory to decide which data format to use(UnsafeRow, ColumnarBatch, etc.). Which means, it's possible to allow different data partitions to be scanned with different formats. Some hybrid storage may keep realtime data in row format, and history data in columnar format, and it can fit the new API well.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\napply this change to the write path(next PR)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting
