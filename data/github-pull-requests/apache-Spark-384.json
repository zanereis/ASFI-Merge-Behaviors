What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSimilar to `TreeNode.transform`, which only apply the rule on its children, `QueryPlan.transformExpressions` should also only apply the rule on its expressions(i.e. returned by `Query.expressions`). I think it's more intuitive to exclude the expressions that are not defined as this plan's expressions, for example, `Generate.generatorOutput` should not be touched by `transformExpressions`.\n\nThis

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrent URL for each application to access history UI is like: \nhttp://localhost:18080/history/application_1457058760338_0016/1/jobs/ or http://localhost:18080/history/application_1457058760338_0016/2/jobs/\n\nHere **1** or **2** represents the number of attempts in `historypage.js`, but it will parse to attempt id in `HistoryServer`, while the correct attempt id should be like \"appattempt_1457058760338_0016_000002\", so it will fail to parse to a correct attempt id in HistoryServer.\n\nThis is OK in yarn client mode, since we don't need this attempt id to fetch out the app cache, but it is failed in yarn cluster mode, where attempt id \"1\" or \"2\" is actually wrong.\n\nSo here we should fix this url to parse the correct application id and attempt id.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch fixes the problem that `bin\\beeline.cmd` pollutes environment variables.\nThe similar problem is reported and fixed in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR split the PhysicalRDD into two classes, PhysicalRDD and PhysicalScan. PhysicalRDD is used for DataFrames that is created from existing RDD. PhysicalScan is used for DataFrame that is created from data sources. This enable use to apply different optimization on both of them.\n\nAlso fix the problem for sameResult() on two DataSourceScan.\n\nAlso fix the equality check to toString for `In`. It's better to use Seq there, but we can't break this public API (sad).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests. Manually tested with TPCDS query Q59 and Q64, all those duplicated exchanges can be re-used now, also saw there are 40+% performance improvement (saving half of the scan).\n","created_at":"2016-03-04T08:05:25Z","updated_at":"2016-07-29T05:29:18Z","closed_at":"2016-03-12T08:50:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"46aedc34c48ddc1e5c4969af6cf2fb51b711ff27","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11514/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11514/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11514/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b3d2df0282f2be935e2976be39544f58e6ee3431","head":{"label":"davies:existing_rdd","ref":"existing_rdd","sha":"b3d2df0282f2be935e2976be39544f58e6ee3431","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch is fixing the race condition in ApplicationMaster when receiving a signal. In the current implementation, if signal is received and with no any exception, this application will be finished with successful state in Yarn, and there's no another attempt. Actually the application is killed by signal in the runtime, so another attempt is expected.\n\nThis patch adds a signal handler to handle the signal things, if signal is received, marking this application finished with failure, rather than success.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis patch is tested with following situations:\n1. Application is finished normally.\n2. Application is finished by calling `System.exit(n)`.\n3. Application is killed by yarn command.\n4. ApplicationMaster is killed by \"SIGTERM\" send by `kill pid` command.\n5. ApplicationMaster is killed by NM with \"SIGTERM\" in case of NM failure.\n\nAll the scenarios return the expected states.\n\nCC @tgravescs , please help to review this fix, thanks a lot.\n","created_at":"2016-03-04T06:08:46Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T08:48:51Z","closed_at":"2016-03-14T06:26:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7f79d7b0f81d2a6d1e8e54398b6de79e4ee5e94e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11512/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11512/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11512/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b461b717ed51b532f823615bcb79f66b17635c4d","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-13642","ref":"SPARK-13642","sha":"b461b717ed51b532f823615bcb79f66b17635c4d","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIf a filter predicate or a join condition consists of `IsNotNull` checks, we should reorder these checks such that these non-nullability checks are evaluated before the rest of the predicates.\n\nFor e.g., if a filter predicate is of the form `a > 5 && isNotNull(b)`, we should rewrite this as `isNotNull(b) && a > 5` during physical plan generation.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew unit tests that verify the physical plan for both filters and joins in `ReorderedPredicateSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-03-04T04:56:48Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T23:42:32Z","closed_at":"2016-03-08T23:42:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"717d4938edf690d8017293e6a164502ca3b87a1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11511/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11511/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11511/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/21d889706052bb4fc3655b9150b00900f88a7388","head":{"label":"sameeragarwal:reorder-isnotnull","ref":"reorder-isnotnull","sha":"21d889706052bb4fc3655b9150b00900f88a7388","user":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20599564,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTU2NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"sameeragarwal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal/spark","description":"Mirror

different things were needed to get rid of spurious warnings:\n- silence deprecation warnings when cloning configuration\n- change the way SparkHadoopUtil instantiates SparkConf to silence\n  warnings\n- avoid creating new SparkConf instances where it's not needed.\n\nOn top of that, I changed the way that Logging.scala detects the repl;\nnow it uses a method that is overridden in the repl's Main class, and\nthe hack in Utils.scala is not needed anymore. This makes the 2.11 repl\nbehave like the 2.10 one and set the default log level to WARN, which\nis a lot better. Previously, this wasn't working because the 2.11 repl\ntriggers log initialization earlier than the 2.10 one.\n\nI also removed and simplified some other code in the 2.11 repl's Main\nto avoid replicating logic that already exists elsewhere in Spark.\n\nTested the 2.11 repl in local and yarn modes.\n","created_at":"2016-03-04T03:56:21Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T21:30:23Z","closed_at":"2016-03-14T21:28:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e51faabb50fae9162d1e6c0197df6b2438c8e359","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11510/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11510/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11510/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d7f1ffa68f22258867b4a4fc6810dc96477d9f23","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-13626","ref":"SPARK-13626","sha":"d7f1ffa68f22258867b4a4fc6810dc96477d9f23","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

is used for reading most files into Spark SQL.  However today this class mixes the concerns of file management, schema reconciliation, scan building, bucketing, partitioning, and writing data.  As a result, many data sources are forced to reimplement the same functionality and the various layers have accumulated a fair bit of inefficiency.  This PR is a first cut at separating this into several components / interfaces that are each described below.  Additionally, all implementations inside of Spark (parquet, csv, json, text, orc, svmlib) have been ported to the new API `FileFormat`.  External libraries, such as spark-avro will also need to be ported to work with Spark 2.0.\n### HadoopFsRelation\n\nA simple `case class` that acts as a container for all of the metadata required to read from a datasource.  All discovery, resolution and merging logic for schemas and partitions has been removed.  This an internal representation that no longer needs to be exposed to developers.\n\n``` scala\ncase class HadoopFsRelation(\n    sqlContext: SQLContext,\n    location: FileCatalog,\n    partitionSchema: StructType,\n    dataSchema: StructType,\n    bucketSpec: Option[BucketSpec],\n    fileFormat: FileFormat,\n    options: Map[String, String]) extends BaseRelation\n```\n### FileFormat\n\nThe primary interface that will be implemented by each different format including external libraries.  Implementors are responsible for reading a given format and converting it into `InternalRow` as well as writing out an `InternalRow`.  A format can optionally return a schema that is inferred from a set of files.\n\n``` scala\ntrait FileFormat {\n  def inferSchema(\n      sqlContext: SQLContext,\n      options: Map[String, String],\n      files: Seq[FileStatus]): Option[StructType]\n\n  def prepareWrite(\n      sqlContext: SQLContext,\n      job: Job,\n      options: Map[String, String],\n      dataSchema: StructType): OutputWriterFactory\n\n  def buildInternalScan(\n      sqlContext: SQLContext,\n      dataSchema: StructType,\n      requiredColumns: Array[String],\n      filters: Array[Filter],\n      bucketSet: Option[BitSet],\n      inputFiles: Array[FileStatus],\n      broadcastedConf: Broadcast[SerializableConfiguration],\n      options: Map[String, String]): RDD[InternalRow]\n}\n```\n\nThe current interface is based on what was required to get all the tests passing again, but still mixes a couple of concerns (i.e. `bucketSet` is passed down to the scan instead of being resolved by the planner).  Additionally, scans are still returning `RDD`s instead of iterators for single files.  In a future PR, bucketing should be removed from this interface and the scan should be isolated to a single file.\n### FileCatalog\n\nThis interface is used to list the files that make up a given relation, as well as handle directory based partitioning.\n\n``` scala\ntrait FileCatalog {\n  def paths: Seq[Path]\n  def partitionSpec(schema: Option[StructType]): PartitionSpec\n  def allFiles(): Seq[FileStatus]\n  def getStatus(path: Path): Array[FileStatus]\n  def refresh(): Unit\n}\n```\n\nCurrently there are two implementations:\n- `HDFSFileCatalog` - based on code from the old `HadoopFsRelation`.  Infers partitioning by recursive listing and caches this data for performance\n- `HiveFileCatalog` - based on the above, but it uses the partition spec from the Hive Metastore.\n### ResolvedDataSource\n\nProduces a logical plan given the following description of a Data Source (which can come from DataFrameReader or a metastore): \n- `paths: Seq[String] = Nil`\n- `userSpecifiedSchema: Option[StructType] = None`\n- `partitionColumns: Array[String] = Array.empty`\n- `bucketSpec: Option[BucketSpec] = None`\n- `provider: String`\n- `options: Map[String, String]`\n\nThis class is responsible for deciding which of the Data Source APIs a given provider is using (including the non-file based ones).  All reconciliation of partitions, buckets, schema from metastores or inference is done here.\n### DataSourceAnalysis / DataSourceStrategy\n\nResponsible for analyzing and planning reading/writing of data using any of the Data Source APIs, including:\n- pruning the files from partitions that will be read based on filters.\n- appending partition columns*\n- applying additional filters when a data source can not evaluate them internally.\n- constructing an RDD that is bucketed correctly when required*\n- sanity checking schema match-up and other analysis when writing.\n\n*In the future we should do that following:\n- Break out file handling into its own Strategy as its sufficiently complex / isolated.\n- Push the appending of partition columns down in to `FileFormat` to avoid an extra copy / unvectorization.\n- Use a custom RDD for scans instead of `SQLNewNewHadoopRDD2`\n","created_at":"2016-03-04T03:10:26Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T19:11:11Z","closed_at":"2016-03-07T23:17:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"39f9c6b19f042b03ea9ecc050e1586a2e78ba62a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11509/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11509/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11509/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3e5c7b72c184f0e37d65fad94cf6f21fbd6400da","head":{"label":"marmbrus:fileDataSource","ref":"fileDataSource","sha":"3e5c7b72c184f0e37d65fad94cf6f21fbd6400da","user":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17230869,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMDg2OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"marmbrus/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIf a job is being scheduled in one thread which has a dependency on an\nRDD currently executing a shuffle in another thread, Spark would throw a\nNullPointerException. This patch synchronizes access to `mapStatuses` and\nskips null status entries (which are in-progress shuffle tasks).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nOur client code unit test suite, which was reliably reproducing the race\ncondition with 10 threads, shows that this fixes it. I have not found a minimal\ntest case to add to Spark, but I will attempt to do so if desired.\n\nThe same test case was tripping up on SPARK-4454, which was fixed by\nmaking other DAGScheduler code thread-safe.\n\n@shivaram @srowen

preparation for larger refactoring, this patch removes the confusing `returnValues` option from the BlockStore put() APIs: returning the value is only useful in one place (caching) and in other situations, such as block replication, it's simpler to put() and then get().\n\nAs part of this change, I needed to refactor `BlockManager.doPut()`'s block replication code. I also changed `doPut()` to access the memory and disk stores directly rather than calling them through the BlockStore interface; this is in anticipation of a followup patch to remove the BlockStore interface so that the disk store can expose a binary-data-oriented API which is not concerned with Java objects or serialization.\n\nThese changes should be covered by the existing storage unit tests. The best way to review this patch is probably to look at the individual commits, all of which are small and have useful descriptions to guide the review.\n\n/cc @davies for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn order to avoid StackOverflow when parse a expression with hundreds of ORs, we should use loop instead of recursive functions to flatten the tree as list. This PR also build a balanced tree to reduce the depth of generated And/Or expression, to avoid StackOverflow in analyzer/optimizer.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdd new unit tests. Manually tested with TPCDS Q3 with hundreds predicates in it [1]. These predicates help to reduce the number of partitions, then the query time went from 60 seconds to 8 seconds.\n\n[1]

patch splits `DiskBlockObjectWriter` into two separate classes so that the object-based and byte-based write methods are cleanly separated. The old design, which put all of these methods in the same interface, caused some weird problems in places which only wanted to use the writer's `OutputStream` methods, since those places would need to pass a `DummySerializerInstance` into the writer's constructor.\n\nThis patch introduces a `DiskBlockWriter` which exposes only the OutputStream write methods and modifies the `DiskBlockObjectWriter` to wrap `DiskBlockWriter` and expose only object-based write methods.\n\nI also moved the disk-writing-related classes into a new `o.a.s.storage.disk` package, since the `o.a.s.storage` package had too many classes in it.\n","created_at":"2016-03-03T19:25:00Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T00:33:15Z","closed_at":"2016-08-25T00:33:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11498/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11498/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11498/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0fee6042a7cff69747f454056fd5cec6640dc381","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:disk-writer-cleanup","ref":"disk-writer-cleanup","sha":"0fee6042a7cff69747f454056fd5cec6640dc381","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n- OffHeapMemoryBlock is introduced which holds reference to java.nio.DirectByteBuffer.\n  This allows to have offheap memory which is automatically deallocated by JVM.\n- spark.unsafe.Platform interface refactored from indefinite Objects, to MemoryBlocks and arrays of primitives. This has led to large code changes in core, catalyst, sql.\n- org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codege.BufferHolder is replaced by MemoryBlockHolder which tests spark.memory.offHeap.enadled configuration property and allocates ByteArrayMemoryBlock or OffHeapMemoryBlock.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nmvn

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFixes compile problem due to inadvertent use of `Option.contains`, only in Scala 2.11. The change should have been to replace `Option.exists(_ == x)` with `== Some(x)`. Replacing exists with contains only makes sense for collections. Replacing use of `Option.exists` still makes sense though as it's misleading.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins tests / compilation\n\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn WebUI, now Jetty Server starts with SPARK_LOCAL_IP config value if it\nis configured otherwise it starts with default value as '0.0.0.0'.\n\nIt is continuation as per the closed PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11133 for the JIRA SPARK-13117 and discussion in SPARK-13117.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis has been verified using the command 'netstat -tnlp | grep <PID>' to check on which IP/hostname is binding with the below steps. \n\nIn the below results, mentioned PID in the command is the corresponding process id.\n#### Without the patch changes,\n\nWeb UI(Jetty Server) is not taking the value configured for SPARK_LOCAL_IP and it is listening to all the interfaces. \n###### Master\n\n```\n[devaraj@stobdtserver2

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch does the following: \nI) Adds a new optimizer rule collapsesorts that does the following if global is same for the adjacent sorts.\na)  Collapse adjacent sorts and keep the last sort\nb) Collapse adjacent sorts if there is a project or a limit or a filter in between and keep the last sort. \n\nII) A new test suite CollapseSortsSuite is added with tests. \nAlso note, one of the _testcase (test(\"collapsesorts: test collapsesorts in sort <- limit <- sort scenario\") ) _does not compare with expected plan because of the unapply in Limit will actually remove the LocalLimit from the plan. Hence the test just checks that the collapsesorts rule was exercised by checking for the number of Sort in the plan.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nA)\nFollowing test suites were run and the lint checking was done. No new test failures: \nbuild/sbt -Phive hive/test\nbuild/sbt sql/test\nbuild/sbt catalyst/test\ndev/lint-scala\n\nB) A new test suite CollapseSortsSuite is added with new tests to exercise the collapsesorts rule.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdded a check in pyspark.ml.param.Param.params() to see if an attribute is a property (decorated with `@property`) before checking if it is a `Param` instance.  This prevents the property from being invoked to 'get' this attribute, which could possibly cause an error. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test case with a class has a property that will raise an error when invoked and then call`Param.params` to verify that the property is not invoked, but still able to find another property in the class.  Also ran pyspark-ml test before fix that will trigger an error, and again after the fix to verify that the error was resolved and the method was working properly.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is just the patch of #11449 cherry picked to branch-1.6; the enforcer and dep/ diffs are cut\n\nModifies the dependency declarations of the all the hive artifacts, to explicitly exclude the groovy-all JAR.\n\nThis stops the groovy classes _and everything else in that uber-JAR_ from getting into spark-assembly JAR. \n## How was this patch tested?\n1. Pre-patch build was made: `mvn clean install -Pyarn,hive,hive-thriftserver`\n2. spark-assembly expanded, observed to have the org.codehaus.groovy packages and JARs\n3. A maven dependency tree was created `mvn dependency:tree -Pyarn,hive,hive-thriftserver  -Dverbose > target/dependencies.txt`\n4. This text file examined to confirm that groovy was being imported as a dependency of `org.spark-project.hive`\n5. Patch applied\n6. Repeated step1: clean build of project with `-Pyarn,hive,hive-thriftserver` set\n7. Examined created spark-assembly, verified no org.codehaus packages\n8. Verified that the maven dependency tree no longer references groovy\n\nThe `master` version updates the dependency files and an enforcer rule to keep groovy out; this patch strips it

Or the plan doesn't has a top `Project` from the beginning because it is not necessary. Currently the `SQLBuilder` can't convert such plans back to SQL. This change is to add this feature.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nA test is added to `LogicalPlanToSQLSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-03-02T09:15:50Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:33:17Z","closed_at":"2016-03-03T06:23:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bda2d4499f31b4a52dd6610f479b057f1663c986","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11466/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11466/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11466/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c8d9eeed56da34c739444838a9ff2020b9b00ad2","head":{"label":"viirya:sqlbuilder-notopselect","ref":"sqlbuilder-notopselect","sha":"c8d9eeed56da34c739444838a9ff2020b9b00ad2","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis pr improves compression performance for integer-typed values on cache to reduce GC pressure.\nA goal of this activity is to make in-memory cache size approaching to parquet formatted data size on disk. Since spark uses simpler compression algorithms than parquet does in `compressionSchemes`,\nthe size of in-memory columnar cache is much bigger than parquet data on disk. In one use-case (See https://www.mail-archive.com/user@spark.apache.org/msg45241.html), 24.59GB of parquet data on disk becomes 41.7GB on cache. This pr uses bit packers implemented in parquet-column that spark already has as a package dependency.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdd `DeltaBinaryPackingSuite` that uses  various input patterns for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is to prune unnecessary columns when the operator is  `MapPartitions`. The solution is to add an extra `Project` in the child node. \n\nFor the other two operators `AppendColumns` and `MapGroups`, it sounds doable. More discussions are required. The major reason is the current implementation of the `inputPlan` of `groupBy` is based on the child of `AppendColumns`. It might be a bug? Thus, will submit a separate PR. \n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test case in ColumnPruningSuite to verify the rule. Added another test case in DatasetSuite.scala to verify the data.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nHere lists all cases that Master cannot talk with Worker for a while and then network is back.\n1. Master doesn't know the network issue (not yet timeout)\n   \n   a. Worker doesn't know the network issue (onDisconnected is not called)\n   - Worker keeps sending Heartbeat. Both Worker and Master don't know the network issue. Nothing to do. (Finally, Master will notice the heartbeat timeout if network is not recovered)\n   \n   b. Worker knows the network issue (onDisconnected is called)\n   - Worker stops sending Heartbeat and sends `RegisterWorker` to master. Master will reply `RegisterWorkerFailed(\"Duplicate worker ID\")`. Worker calls \"System.exit(1)\" (Finally, Master will notice the heartbeat timeout if network is not recovered) (May leak driver processes. See [SPARK-13602](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13602))\n2. Worker timeout (Master knows the network issue). In such case,  master removes Worker and its executors and drivers.\n   \n   a. Worker doesn't know the network issue (onDisconnected is not called)\n   - Worker keeps sending Heartbeat.\n   - If the network is back, say Master receives Heartbeat, Master sends `ReconnectWorker` to Worker\n   - Worker send `RegisterWorker` to master.\n   - Master accepts `RegisterWorker` but doesn't know executors and drivers in Worker. (may leak executors)\n   \n   b. Worker knows the network issue (onDisconnected is called)\n   - Worker stop sending `Heartbeat`. Worker will send \"RegisterWorker\" to master.\n   - Master accepts `RegisterWorker` but doesn't know executors and drivers in Worker. (may leak executors)\n\nThis PR fixes executors and drivers leak in 2.a and 2.b when Worker reregisters with Master. The approach is making Worker send `WorkerLatestState` to sync the state after registering with master successfully. Then Master will ask Worker to kill unknown executors and drivers. \n\nNote:  Worker cannot just kill executors after registering with master because in the worker, `LaunchExecutor` and `RegisteredWorker` are processed in two threads. If `LaunchExecutor` happens before `RegisteredWorker`, Worker's executor list will contain new executors after Master accepts `RegisterWorker`. We should not kill these executors. So sending the list to Master and let Master tell Worker which executors should be killed. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\ntest(\"SPARK-13604: Master should ask Worker kill unknown executors and drivers\")\n","created_at":"2016-03-02T00:43:56Z","updated_at":"2016-03-11T19:12:15Z","closed_at":"2016-03-11T01:00:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b0b666624e99bfe80f618a107d6571247f262f81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11455/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11455/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11455/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/51ac6dd2f0e454f07e9cf0b2225e56c3aad841db","head":{"label":"zsxwing:orphan-executors","ref":"orphan-executors","sha":"51ac6dd2f0e454f07e9cf0b2225e56c3aad841db","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d6969ffc0f86c8a4ea0e94d06cb227178b000962","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

part of the goal to stop creating assemblies in Spark, this change\nmodifies the mvn and sbt builds to not create an assembly for examples.\n\nInstead, dependencies are copied to the build directory (under\ntarget/scala-xx/jars), and in the final archive, into the \"examples/jars\"\ndirectory.\n\nTo avoid having to deal too much with Windows batch files, I made examples\nrun through the launcher library; the spark-submit launcher now has a\nspecial mode to run examples, which adds all the necessary jars to the\nspark-submit command line, and replaces the bash and batch scripts that\nwere used to run examples. The scripts are now just a thin wrapper around\nspark-submit; another advantage is that now all spark-submit options are\nsupported.\n\nThere are a few glitches; in the mvn build, a lot of duplicated dependencies\nget copied, because they are promoted to \"compile\" scope due to extra\ndependencies in the examples module (such as HBase). In the sbt build,\nall dependencies are copied, because there doesn't seem to be an easy\nway to filter things.\n\nI plan to clean some of this up when the rest of the tasks are finished.\nWhen the main assembly is replaced with jars, we can remove duplicate jars\nfrom the examples directory during packaging.\n\nTested by running SparkPi in: maven build, sbt build, dist created by\nmake-distribution.sh.\n\nFinally: note that running the \"assembly\" target in sbt doesn't build\nthe examples anymore. You need to run \"package\" for that.\n","created_at":"2016-03-01T23:03:15Z","updated_at":"2016-04-05T20:24:11Z","closed_at":"2016-03-15T16:46:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"501e09cbdb6392b0b0c2a0e2c8ca9d543f12e9ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11452/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11452/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11452/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e9ab00383714b3d1d6c56d226c8d165739f6ee85","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-13576","ref":"SPARK-13576","sha":"e9ab00383714b3d1d6c56d226c8d165739f6ee85","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nModifies the dependency declarations of the all the hive artifacts, to explicitly exclude the groovy-all JAR.\n\nThis stops the groovy classes _and everything else in that uber-JAR_ from getting into spark-assembly JAR. \n## How was this patch tested?\n1. Pre-patch build was made: `mvn clean install -Pyarn,hive,hive-thriftserver`\n2. spark-assembly expanded, observed to have the org.codehaus.groovy packages and JARs\n3. A maven dependency tree was created `mvn dependency:tree -Pyarn,hive,hive-thriftserver  -Dverbose > target/dependencies.txt`\n4. This text file examined to confirm that groovy was being imported as a dependency of `org.spark-project.hive`\n5. Patch applied\n6. Repeated step1: clean build of project with `-Pyarn,hive,hive-thriftserver` set\n7. Examined created spark-assembly, verified no org.codehaus packages\n8. Verified that the maven dependency tree no longer references groovy\n\nNote also that the size of the assembly JAR was 181628646 bytes before this patch, 166318515 after —15MB smaller. That's a good metric of things being excluded\n","created_at":"2016-03-01T18:19:35Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T16:16:28Z","closed_at":"2016-03-03T17:37:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"42158b203c442169c1c5e8cf31bea86a5456e22d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11449/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11449/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11449/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8b6f42297cd84d792442e98b7f3f96e2290e8a03","head":{"label":"steveloughran:fixes/SPARK-13599-groovy-dependency","ref":"fixes/SPARK-13599-groovy-dependency","sha":"8b6f42297cd84d792442e98b7f3f96e2290e8a03","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32387210,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM4NzIxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"steveloughran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran/spark","description":"Mirror

example, `df = rdd.toDF(\"a: int, b: string\")`.\nIt also supports flat schema so users can convert an RDD of int to DataFrame directly, we will automatically wrap int to row for users.\nIf schema is given, now we checks if the real data matches the given schema, and throw error if it doesn't.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew tests in `test.py` and doc test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR unifies DataFrame and Dataset by migrating existing DataFrame operations to Dataset and make `DataFrame` a type alias of `Dataset[Row]`.\r\n\r\nMost Scala code changes are source compatible, but Java API is broken as Java knows nothing about Scala type alias (mostly replacing `DataFrame` with `Dataset<Row>`).\r\n\r\nThere are several noticeable API changes related to those returning arrays:\r\n1.  `collect`/`take`\r\n\r\n    - Old APIs in class `DataFrame`:\r\n\r\n      ``` scala\r\n      def collect(): Array[Row]\r\n      def take(n: Int): Array[Row]\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n    - New APIs in class `Dataset[T]`:\r\n\r\n      ``` scala\r\n      def collect(): Array[T]\r\n      def take(n: Int): Array[T]\r\n\r\n      def collectRows(): Array[Row]\r\n      def takeRows(n: Int): Array[Row]\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n    Two specialized methods `collectRows` and `takeRows` are added because Java doesn't support returning generic arrays. Thus, for example, `DataFrame.collect(): Array[T]` actually returns `Object` instead of `Array<T>` from Java side.\r\n\r\n    Normally, Java users may fall back to `collectAsList` and `takeAsList`.  The two new specialized versions are added to avoid performance regression in ML related code (but maybe I'm wrong and they are not necessary here).\r\n\r\n2.  `randomSplit`\r\n\r\n    - Old APIs in class `DataFrame`:\r\n\r\n      ``` scala\r\n      def randomSplit(weights: Array[Double], seed: Long): Array[DataFrame]\r\n      def randomSplit(weights: Array[Double]): Array[DataFrame]\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n    - New APIs in class `Dataset[T]`:\r\n\r\n      ``` scala\r\n      def randomSplit(weights: Array[Double], seed: Long): Array[Dataset[T]]\r\n      def randomSplit(weights: Array[Double]): Array[Dataset[T]]\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n    Similar problem as above, but hasn't been addressed for Java API yet.  We can probably add `randomSplitAsList` to fix this one.\r\n\r\n3.  `groupBy`\r\n\r\n    Some original `DataFrame.groupBy` methods have conflicting signature with original `Dataset.groupBy` methods.  To distinguish these two, typed `Dataset.groupBy` methods are renamed to `groupByKey`.\r\n\r\nOther noticeable changes:\r\n\r\n1.  Dataset always do eager analysis now\r\n\r\n    We used to support disabling DataFrame eager analysis to help reporting partially analyzed malformed logical plan on analysis failure.  However, Dataset encoders requires eager analysi during Dataset construction.  To preserve the error reporting feature, `AnalysisException` now takes an extra `Option[LogicalPlan]` argument to hold the partially analyzed plan, so that we can check the plan tree when reporting test failures.  This plan is passed by `QueryExecution.assertAnalyzed`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests do the work.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] Fix all tests\r\n- [ ] Re-enable MiMA check\r\n- [ ] Update ScalaDoc (`@since`, `@group`, and example code)\r\n","created_at":"2016-03-01T11:16:08Z","updated_at":"2017-05-03T17:25:20Z","closed_at":"2016-03-11T01:01:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fba719092651f7ffd9e991368077791f96f57cce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11443/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11443/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11443/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7d29c0637222e9a87755a50785c0580c3cf8fcb0","head":{"label":"liancheng:ds-to-df","ref":"ds-to-df","sha":"7d29c0637222e9a87755a50785c0580c3cf8fcb0","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen calling .sql, back-ticks are automatically added. When using .sql as AttributeReference/Alias names, we hit a couple of issues when doing logicalPlan to SQL. Parser is unable to recognize it.\n\nFor example, the name could be converted to \n\n```\n`sum(`name`)`\n```\n\nThis PR is to follow the same way to remove back-ticks from names as what we did in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10757. \n\n*_Question: *_ This is a common issue. I am afraid the future coders might miss that. Should we call `usePrettyExpression` every time when we creating an alias name or attributeReference name? Or add another function (e.g., .sqlToName) like `.sql`? Thanks!\n\n@liancheng @cloud-fan \n#### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR defer the resolution from a id of dictionary to value until the column is actually accessed (inside getInt/getLong), this is very useful for those columns and rows that are filtered out. It's also useful for binary type, we will not need to copy all the byte arrays.\n\nThis PR also change the underlying type for small decimal that could be fit within a Int, in order to use getInt() to lookup the value from IntDictionary.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually test TPCDS Q7 with scale factor 10, saw about 30% improvements (after PR #11274).

directly calls MemoryStore.unrollSafely() and has its own logic for handling graceful fallback to disk when cached data does not fit in memory. However, this logic also exists inside of the MemoryStore itself, so this appears to be unnecessary duplication.\n\nThanks to the addition of block-level read/write locks in #10705, we can refactor the code to remove the CacheManager and replace it with an atomic `BlockManager.getOrElseUpdate()` method.\n\nThis pull request replaces / subsumes #10748.\n\n/cc @andrewor14 and @nongli for review. Note that this changes the locking semantics of a couple of internal BlockManager methods (`doPut()` and `lockNewBlockForWriting`), so please pay attention to the Scaladoc changes and new test cases for those methods.\n","created_at":"2016-02-29T22:42:40Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T06:18:04Z","closed_at":"2016-03-02T18:29:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"87219189c819bed1a02467f6c415fcba5971ef01","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11436/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11436/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11436/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0aafba29bf99e94f661208841a3a8ae2029d73b2","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:remove-cachemanager","ref":"remove-cachemanager","sha":"0aafba29bf99e94f661208841a3a8ae2029d73b2","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix)\n\nCurrently, the parquet reader returns rows one by one which is bad for performance. This patch\nupdates the reader to directly return ColumnarBatches. This is only enabled with whole stage\ncodegen, which is the only operator currently that is able to consume ColumnarBatches (instead\nof rows). The current implementation is a bit of a hack to get this to work and we should do\nmore refactoring of these low level interfaces to make this work better.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n```\nResults:\nTPCDS:                             Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nq55

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdd `get/setCurrentDatabase` methods to the internal catalog used by `SQLContext`. This was already available in `HiveContext`, so we should add it to `SQLContext` too to facilitate the merging of the two contexts.\n\nNote: there are two catalogs, `analysis.Catalog` and `catalog.Catalog`. The former is used currently in the contexts and the latter is not used yet. I added this functionality to both catalogs for now, but in the future one catalog will call the other so we don't have to duplicate functionality.\n\nAll API changes in this PR are internal.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting Jenkins tests + new test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR migrates basic inspection and typed relational operations from DataFrame to Dataset. This is the first step of unifying DataFrame and Dataset API.\n## TODO\n- [ ] Migrate `explode` operations.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nCorresponding test cases are migrated from `DataFrameSuite` to `DatasetSuite`. These newly added test cases all share the same \"df-to-ds\" prefix so that we can easily execute them under SBT using:\n\n```\nsql/test-only *.DatasetSuite -- -z \"df-to-ds\"\n```\n\nThis prefix will be removed after migrating all the DataFrame operations.\n","created_at":"2016-02-29T12:38:35Z","updated_at":"2016-03-11T01:21:12Z","closed_at":"2016-03-11T01:21:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e899c29b6436fb9c4043de504298775d46846de7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11431/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11431/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11431/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6cb945fce95ce3787391dc9b84d1be31ea3e02f9","head":{"label":"liancheng:df-to-ds-typed-relational","ref":"df-to-ds-typed-relational","sha":"6cb945fce95ce3787391dc9b84d1be31ea3e02f9","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror
