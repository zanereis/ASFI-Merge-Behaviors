is a PR for adding federated code generation for cellwise templates, and the respective tests.\r\nInside the test class, there are two datasets outcommented. The first one fails because we are fusing the sequence operation into the Spoof class without adjusting the grix parameter of the genexec call to the individual offsets of the federated matrix paritions. The second test fails because it doesn't create a federated instruction of the spoof operator (due to indexing, where the matrix gets copied to the coordinator).\r\nI've implemented a fix for adjusting the grix to correctly include sequences with federated operations in a previous commit (43e9ff2), but it isn't a nice fix (adding a suffix to the instruction string whenever it is a federated spoof operation) so I removed it. Maybe we can exclude the sequence operation from code generation?\r\n\r\nThanks for review

PR contain a few changes.\r\n\r\nMost notably Backward max pooling goes from 15 sec to 1 sec on MNIST, by exploiting that outputs are known to be sparse in the kernel size of the pooling. Meaning if the kernel is 2x2x2 the number of output nnz is guaranteed to be 1/8 number of cells. Before this change every invocation of max pooling allocated a dense matrix, that after execution was reallocated as sparse.\r\n\r\nEnd to end performance is decreased to 140 from 188 sec.\r\n\r\nOther items:\r\n\r\n- Force dense matrices to encourage native calls of Conv2d, conv2d backward filter, conv2d backward data. This is done because the current implementations supporting sparse is slower than forcing the inputs into dense and then calling natively. we gain 10 seconds here\r\n- LastRowDenseGeneric is optimized for dense aggregation, instead of using quick get and set this give 5 seconds.\r\n- Remove examine sparsity in the Generic aggregation, since this in some executions change the aggregating matrix from dense to sparse, just to in the next invocation change back to dense.\r\n- Remove unused statistics in DNN (no extra performance)\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-25T16:14:32Z","updated_at":"2021-03-30T08:47:38Z","closed_at":"2021-03-27T10:09:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ffc38a7133ee6a51f5541cfd52c10ad883b460ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1213/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1213/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1213/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/c5407bd6b827fc32c4c49cc9474c10bd6c448930","head":{"label":"Baunsgaard:Conv2d-3","ref":"Conv2d-3","sha":"c5407bd6b827fc32c4c49cc9474c10bd6c448930","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":250787012,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTA3ODcwMTI=","name":"systemds","full_name":"Baunsgaard/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard/systemds","description":"Mirror

Hauptproblem, welches wir derzeit haben liegt darin das wir nicht verstehen, warum der Parameter „cur_small_nodes“ = 0 ist. Während wir glauben, dass wir das Binning richtig initialisieren, auch die entsprechende Matrix zurückgeben, wird dennoch kein \"small node\" gefunden. Folglich wird die perform schleife in Zeile 741  ausgeführt mit 1:0 was einen Error wirft. Wir haben ebenfalls die gesamte parfor in eine if Abfrage gegeben, welche bei dem Fall, dass \"cur_num_small_nodes = 0\" ist die gesamte parfor überspringt dennoch werden weitere Errors geworfen.\r\nBeim Debuggen haben wir herausgefunden das „cur_num_small_nodes“ von „cur_max_I_gain“ abhängt. Dieses wiederrum hängt von „I_gain_portion“ usw. ab. Am Ende haben wir uns komplett darin verloren herauszufinden an welchem Parameter es am Endeffekt wirklich liegt.\r\n\r\nZusatzbemerkung:\r\nDie implementierte Binning funktion wurde von uns zum Zwecke des debuggings extrem vereinfacht und auf 2 while schleifen geändert. In der originalen, haben wir alles innerhalb einer while schleife berechnet (Mittels arithmetischem Mittel) und zurückgegeben, zum Zwecke der Errorsuche haben wir diese vereinfacht um mögliche Fehler schneller zu finden.\r\n\r\n**Edit for archival purpose: (english translation)**\r\n\r\nThe main problem we currently have is that we don't understand why the parameter \"cur_small_nodes\" = 0. While we believe that we initialize the `binning` correctly and also return the corresponding matrix, no \"small node\" is found. As a result, the parfor loop in line 741 is executed with 1: 0, which throws an error.\r\n\r\nWe have also given the entire `parfor` in an `if` query, which skips the entire `parfor` in the case that `cur_num_small_nodes = 0` but further errors are thrown.\r\nWhile debugging we found out that `cur_num_small_nodes` depends on `cur_max_I_gain`. This in turn depends on `I_gain_portion` and so on. In the end we got completely lost in figuring out which parameters really mattered in the end.\r\n\r\nAdditional remark:\r\nThe implemented `binning` function was extremely simplified by us for the purpose of debugging and changed to 2 `while loops`. In the original, we calculated everything within a while loop (using the arithmetic mean) and returned it, for the purpose of error search we have simplified it in order to find possible errors more quickly.\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-17T17:14:08Z","updated_at":"2021-05-07T05:52:39Z","closed_at":"2021-04-03T22:51:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7d7376fdf6c9865f43bdeae9b281e8eeaa91e40b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1204/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1204/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1204/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/debdcbaf10790b6480026528be195d208262665a","head":{"label":"ChristofJ95:master","ref":"master","sha":"debdcbaf10790b6480026528be195d208262665a","user":{"login":"ChristofJ95","id":16102729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTAyNzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16102729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristofJ95","html_url":"https://github.com/ChristofJ95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristofJ95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristofJ95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristofJ95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristofJ95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristofJ95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristofJ95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristofJ95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristofJ95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristofJ95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b081a25e952cea31b788a4a5942390811a9f9fa6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45896813,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTg5NjgxMw==","name":"systemds","full_name":"apache/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds","description":"An

PR adds compilation of federated instructions when `OptimizerUtils.FEDERATED_COMPILATION` is set to true. \r\nAdditionally, a federated output flag is added and propagated through HOPs, LOPs, and instructions. The federated output flag will later be used to change the processing of federated instructions so that the output of federated instructions are not retrieved before all subsequent federated instructions have been executed. \r\nThe federated compilation and propagation of the federated output flag will be extended to other operations in future PRs. \r\n\r\nSeveral design decisions have been made in this PR, for instance the decision to add the federated output flag as an additional operand in the instruction string. It could also have been added as a property of the output operand, but this would have consequences on how CPOperands are handled in the system. Comments on this or new ideas are appreciated.

commit modifies the code our MMChain operation in CLA to use the\r\nmatrix operations rather than the vector operations. furthermore if found\r\nto be prudent the mmchain will now no longer decompress.\r\n\r\nThe right Matrix Multiplication is changed to include a decompression\r\nfrom compressed overlapping, since the decompression operation is more\r\noptimized than the decompression internal to the right matrix multiplication.\r\nThis also gives a clearer view of where we are using our time in the\r\nstatistics output of the execution.\r\n\r\nThe modifications made LmCG go from ~250 to ~90 sec\r\nwhile ULA is at 200sec (unlike the paper this is with num cols

commit adds an mapping abstract and some implementations of this to\r\nallow DDC to use an arbitrary number of bits per entry.\r\nthe numbers currently supported are 1 8 16 and 32 While there is added\r\na student task to make others.\r\n\r\nFurthermore this abstract is also used in SDC with similar benefits for\r\nbetter compression.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed in this commit various bugs, and improved compression ratio\r\nto 23x on census from 15x. this gives a PCA execution time 1.4x faster\r\nincluding IO and compression for both census and classic MNIST.\r\n\r\nThis commit also contain the beginning of a insertion sorter for\r\nefficient construction of SDC column groups, but currently only a naive\r\nimplementation is added that works well for few unique values, but does\r\nnot scale well to larger amounts.\r\n\r\nNormal:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9947148/110134970-489e4900-7dce-11eb-887b-3cee4d76c419.png)\r\n\r\nCLA:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9947148/110135016-53f17480-7dce-11eb-8321-da6ef8606530.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-05T15:17:55Z","updated_at":"2021-03-07T09:09:11Z","closed_at":"2021-03-05T20:28:12Z","merged_at":"2021-03-05T20:28:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"32c86b5e169eecb134c178195ff8f25738a1fe59","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1196/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1196/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1196/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/32c86b5e169eecb134c178195ff8f25738a1fe59","head":{"label":"Baunsgaard:Compression02","ref":"Compression02","sha":"32c86b5e169eecb134c178195ff8f25738a1fe59","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":250787012,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTA3ODcwMTI=","name":"systemds","full_name":"Baunsgaard/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard/systemds","description":"Mirror

PR contains an addition to slice compressed, that allows the slices not to decompress the entire matrix, but only the sliced parts. The implementation handle the following cases:\r\n\r\n- single value slice, is replaced by a getValue() that is placed into a new matrix output.\r\n- Row slices, that only decompress the rows selected\r\n- Column slices, that maintain compressed outputs.\r\n- Selective row/col slices that leverage first the column slice followed by a decompressing row slice.\r\n\r\nA further improvement would be to maintain compression if the Row slice is large enough to do so. But this would require further work.","created_at":"2021-01-27T12:35:18Z","updated_at":"2021-01-27T17:29:40Z","closed_at":"2021-01-27T17:27:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0565a2ba0af3025107ebb2cbf97b0ba5c20b512e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1173/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1173/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1173/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/e6f6ce0a4c030413c9a3e6b5bf42812b895b42cf","head":{"label":"Baunsgaard:CompressedSlice","ref":"CompressedSlice","sha":"e6f6ce0a4c030413c9a3e6b5bf42812b895b42cf","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":250787012,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTA3ODcwMTI=","name":"systemds","full_name":"Baunsgaard/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard/systemds","description":"Mirror

is a PR for adding federated Als-CG as a first algorithm-level test for federated quaternary operations.\r\nI also added a branch inside FEDInstructionUtils for rewriting BinarySP instructions into BinaryFED instructions in order to support the \"fed_!=\" instruction needed inside the als-CG algorithm. Since I haven't found a test for these federated operations, I added a test for MatrixScalar and MatrixMatrix federated logical operations.\r\nI made a small fix (I hope it was a fix xD) inside BinaryMatrixMatrixFEDInstruction by changing a broadcast() to a broadcastSliced().\r\nHope that was not too much, otherwise just revert the last commit (bce7fdc) and the AlsCG test is using \"sp_!=\" for spark execution mode again.\r\n\r\nThanks for review

PR contains an initial implementation of a text tokenizer that serves as a design proposal. \r\n\r\n## Why does SystemDS benefit from an built-in tokenizer feature?\r\n\r\nA built-in tokenizer is an important feature to allow end-to-end machine learning. At the moment SystemDS expects textual data to be provided in a tokenized form. For instance, one test case reads the 20 newsgroup dataset in bag-of-words (BoW) format. \r\nCurrently, SystemDS supports transformations for frame-to-matrix and vice versa, as well as row-wise transformations via `map()`. However, textual data can be of arbitrary length. Thus, it does not fit the already built-in row-wise (i.e., one-to-one) mapping.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Tokenize API\r\n\r\nOur proposed tokenizer API is tailored towards SystemDs and provides a `tokenize()` function that enables frame to frame transformation using a JSON specification similar to the transform function. We have included an initial draft implementation (minimalistic whitespace tokenizer for BoW format), which shows how we would incorporate the tokenization feature and showcases it with test cases.\r\nSimilar to the transform functions, this should be extendable with new algorithms each with different configuration options and executable in a distributed way (Spark/Hybrid execution). \r\nThe details are described in the [DML reference](https://github.com/apache/systemds/blob/f0d82002b85c9493940e20e240235345d1677b6e/docs/site/dml-language-reference.md#processing-frames).\r\n\r\n## State of PR\r\n\r\nThis PR is not to be merged at the moment, but should provide a way to discuss and improve the design considerations. We plan to integrate more tokenizers and improve the options to configure the algorithms, as well as showcase the usage of the tokenizer by creating a standard natural language pipeline  (e.g., preprocess, tokenize, classify).\r\n\r\n## Authors of PR\r\n\r\nThis design proposal was jointly authored by @Iseratho, @skogler, and @davidfroehlich.\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-21T18:47:58Z","updated_at":"2021-03-04T10:07:49Z","closed_at":"2021-03-04T10:06:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8da7ea4f9b038c83edc0ce12a7c9e838b8aa9cfa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1169/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1169/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1169/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/5c6f4b6b1524b40c653d80dddc45ba5570609d97","head":{"label":"Iseratho:dia21","ref":"dia21","sha":"5c6f4b6b1524b40c653d80dddc45ba5570609d97","user":{"login":"Iseratho","id":1221576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjE1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1221576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho","html_url":"https://github.com/Iseratho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":257359420,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTczNTk0MjA=","name":"systemml","full_name":"Iseratho/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Iseratho","id":1221576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjE1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1221576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho","html_url":"https://github.com/Iseratho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Iseratho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Iseratho/systemml","description":"Mirror

collapsed representation is that individual columns in the output have values that compress very nicely in lossy compression for individual columns, since each column after a matrix multiplication

commit adds a new StatementBlockRewriteRule removing (par)for-loops which are known to iterate over an empty sequence, and, thus, will not perform a single iteration. This works if the loop's from, to, and increment are constants (possibly DML script arguments, and after constant folding). Furthermore, OptimizerUtils has a new flag determining whether this rule shall be applied. In ProgramRewriter's default rule sequence, this new rule is inserted directly after the removal of unnecessary branches, since they have a lot in common. Merging subsequent blocks is done once afterwards if any of removing unnecessary branches or removing\r\n(par)for-loops shall be applied.","created_at":"2021-01-19T20:48:54Z","updated_at":"2021-01-23T19:05:49Z","closed_at":"2021-01-23T19:05:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f7d585ae234b6164283f3a5114273cfe584a5009","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1165/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1165/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1165/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/8c4c6a0ddd88499a80d7499873b4cb30dd7399ab","head":{"label":"pdamme:RewriteRemoveForLoopEmptySequence","ref":"RewriteRemoveForLoopEmptySequence","sha":"8c4c6a0ddd88499a80d7499873b4cb30dd7399ab","user":{"login":"pdamme","id":29231359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjMxMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29231359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme","html_url":"https://github.com/pdamme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":331042388,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzEwNDIzODg=","name":"systemds","full_name":"pdamme/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pdamme","id":29231359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjMxMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29231359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme","html_url":"https://github.com/pdamme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdamme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pdamme/systemds","description":"Mirror

commit change the COST based approach of the rewrite rules for compression to an \"aggressive\" compression approach.\r\nThe basic idea is to introduce many compression instructions into the computation graph, such that we have an compression command at all location that have a potential to:\r\n\r\n1. Compress nicely from uncompressed representation\r\n2. Restructure an already compressed matrix, into a better compression \r\n\r\nFor the 2. case operations such as less than resulting in only 0 and 1 in the matrix have high potential for better restructuring.\r\nBut in general if the matrix inputted before the less than operation is not compressed it will try to compress anyway according to case 1, so no matter which case the instruction introduced should go the same place.\r\n\r\nFor this aggressive compression instruction to execute the object to compress have a few criteria.\r\n\r\n1. There has to be at least 3 instructions executed on the object, that is \"supported compressed operations\" or the matrix is used in a loop.\r\n2. The compressed operations that are used should not have many \"supported but slow operations\".\r\n3. The matrix to compress have to be at least 1000 rows and below 10 columns, or have a ratio of 1000 to nrow/ncol.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-18T17:07:39Z","updated_at":"2021-01-27T17:29:51Z","closed_at":"2021-01-20T09:51:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3b5d9b2099a16e4ab272b177d55247c7b35f8a57","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1164/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1164/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1164/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/cd86d7891d6c4c4db102fea14e23a82edb98a9ad","head":{"label":"Baunsgaard:RewriteRulesCompression","ref":"RewriteRulesCompression","sha":"cd86d7891d6c4c4db102fea14e23a82edb98a9ad","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":250787012,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTA3ODcwMTI=","name":"systemds","full_name":"Baunsgaard/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard/systemds","description":"Mirror

PR contains a lot of valuable features for the parameter server\r\n\r\n### Validation\r\nThere is now a second createPS function in the ParamservBuiltinCPInstruction. If all the additional arguments are specified the parameter server is able to validate after each epoch. It will do so if LOG.info is enabled.\r\nThis feature is implemented for the federated parameter server ONLY, but is easily implemented for the other cases too.\r\n\r\n### Federated Parameter Server Statistics\r\nThe federated parameter server now uses the same statistics as the regular one, where possible. Also a number of new ones were introduced:\r\n* Aggregated Validation Time\r\n* Aggregated Fed Communication Time\r\n* Federated Data Partitioning Time\r\n* Aggregated Fed Batch Weighing Time\r\n* Fed Worker Computation Time (This includes gradient calculation, local updates and batch slicing. The granularity can be improved if needed.)\r\n\r\n### Other Changes\r\n* scaleAndPushGradients was refactored to weighAndPushGradients\r\n* Logging cleanup\r\n* Not implemented exceptions\r\n* Validation Functions for the Federated Parameter Server Test DML files\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-13T21:42:27Z","updated_at":"2021-01-30T22:14:06Z","closed_at":"2021-01-30T22:14:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb6b3614f4e8d3a1c23df4ef15be08444e77ffbf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1154/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1154/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1154/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/f5044d869e662e223a4a462f897715768e9e8cec","head":{"label":"tobiasrieger:validation","ref":"validation","sha":"f5044d869e662e223a4a462f897715768e9e8cec","user":{"login":"tobiasrieger","id":39962737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTYyNzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39962737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger","html_url":"https://github.com/tobiasrieger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":284739507,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODQ3Mzk1MDc=","name":"systemds","full_name":"tobiasrieger/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tobiasrieger","id":39962737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTYyNzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39962737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger","html_url":"https://github.com/tobiasrieger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tobiasrieger/systemds","description":"Mirror

implementation computes a simple gaussian classifier, e.g. it outputs the respective parameters which are needed for classifying.\r\n\r\nAs input, the function basically just receives a feature matrix, and a target vector (and some small value for smoothing along the variances, to prevent numerical errors). The function computes and returns:\r\n\r\n- prior probability\r\n- means\r\n- determinants\r\n- inverse covariance matrix\r\n\r\nper class. \r\nFor classifying one can compute: p(C=c | x) = p(x | c) * p(c)\r\nwhere p(x | c) is the (multivariate) Gaussian PDF for class c, and p(c) is the prior probability for class c. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if and how I can still improve the code, s.t. it fits well into SystemDS. \r\n\r\nOne thing where I was quite unsure was the unit tests. Since calculating determinants and the inverse of the covariance matrices can lead to floating point errors,  I was not quite sure how to compare the results.  I did compare most of them, as suggested in the mailing list, with the avg. bit distance, with a quite high maxUnitsOfLeastPrecssion. \r\nAlthough the values from the inverse covariance matrices  can differ a lot (systemDS vs R), i am pretty sure that the computation  is correct, since multiplying it with the covariance matrix itself, leads to the identity (which I tested during development).

and I have created this first version of the python script generator.\r\nWe've divided the generator into:\r\n\r\n1. A `parser.py` which takes the *.dml scripts and uses the function definition to create a python script. Additionally the parse parses the dml header. The information in the header is used to create a documentation for the python script as well as to check if header information matches the dml function definition.\r\n2. A `generator.py` which takes the parsed data from the `parser.py` and generates a python file. Additionally the generator creates an `__init__.py` file where all generated scripts are added.\r\n\r\nThe scripts are placed under the folder structure `systemds/operator/algorithm/builtin`.\r\nWe have changed a set of dml files in a way that our generator accepts them (kmeans, kmeanspredict, lm, l2svm, pca, multiLogReg, multiLogRegpredict). Those are also builtin functions which already existed in the python API because we could then reuse the testcases for those functions.\r\n\r\nOur generated scripts can be imported as before when the functions where placed in `algorthms.py`. Therefore we think that the file `algorithm.py` can be removed.\r\n\r\nHowever we have 2 concerns regarding the *.dml scripts.\r\n1. Some builtin functions such as `multiLogReg` for example require additional shape checks. \r\n````\r\n    if -1 in x.shape:\r\n        output_shape = (-1,)\r\n    else:\r\n        output_shape = (x.shape[1],)\r\n````\r\nWe were wondering how our parses could use the dml file to create those checks, since they kind of depend on the function itself. \r\n\r\n2. In the `pca.dml` file 4 return values are defined. However for the python script we were only allowed to set the `OperationNode`like this `number_of_outputs=2, output_types=[OutputType.MATRIX, OutputType.MATRIX]`.\r\nWhy is it that the `pca.dml` defined 4 return values but the OperationNode only allowes the `number_of_outputs=2`?\r\n\r\nWe would really appreciate some feedback and maybe some suggestions on how we could handle the two problems mentioned above.","created_at":"2021-01-13T16:25:53Z","updated_at":"2021-03-01T12:15:15Z","closed_at":"2021-02-26T11:41:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bb095d173210fc805e901ed071c3093d567f11c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1152/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1152/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1152/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/2ea636c380d9ffc534dab84bd5875075f0d9997b","head":{"label":"juliale-15:dev","ref":"dev","sha":"2ea636c380d9ffc534dab84bd5875075f0d9997b","user":{"login":"juliale-15","id":63190399,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTkwMzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63190399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15","html_url":"https://github.com/juliale-15","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":253444332,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTM0NDQzMzI=","name":"systemml","full_name":"juliale-15/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliale-15","id":63190399,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTkwMzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63190399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15","html_url":"https://github.com/juliale-15","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliale-15/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juliale-15/systemml","description":"Mirror

commit contains various changes (some massive ones).\r\nThe biggest change is the ordering of compression steps, of which\r\nnow we classify first on a sample of the data. Since this was experimented\r\nto be 10-30% faster. Furthermore this allows us to try compression at a\r\nlower cost if the compression is not valid to perform.\r\n\r\nOverall Compression time for covtype went from\r\n - ~1.0 to 0.36 sec (including read from disk) 0.11 sec compression\r\n\r\nFurthermore now unlike before the transpose is heuristically chosen, Since\r\nit is more efficient not to transpose the matrix for compression in some\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n- Compressed Sparse matrix multiplication fix\r\n- modified matrix multiplication to push down information of\r\n  transposing to the ba+* op. to allow not decompressing the matrix.\r\n- Configuration option of enabling and disabling overlapping compression.\r\n- decompress row section direct access to the matrix block not using\r\n  quick set/get.\r\n- adding safe boolean to decompress to specify if management of\r\n  nnz should be done. This allows the decompression of intermediates at\r\n  near half the computation cost.\r\n- Add configuration for sampling ratio default 0.01 but with a minimum\r\n  sample size of 2000 elements.\r\n- DML Config settings for Cocode-Compression method default to COST\r\n- add support for right sparse matrix multiplication with overlapping\r\n  output. Further improvements are on the way.\r\n- Compression statistics are added when statistics and compression is\r\n  enabled\r\n- Readers for extracting bitmaps are optimized for either transposed or\r\n  untransposed matrices giving 5-15% improved performance.\r\n- Hashmaps are modified to improve insertion time since previously they\r\n  would hash values twice 10% improved performance. furthermore the\r\n  default sizes are modified to start smaller.\r\n- Additional tests for multipication to cover different edge cases.","created_at":"2021-01-08T16:37:00Z","updated_at":"2021-01-14T09:55:33Z","closed_at":"2021-01-08T18:46:13Z","merged_at":"2021-01-08T18:46:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"12cdc89a31d1b33728bf074005aa426f1beac11d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1148/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1148/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1148/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/12cdc89a31d1b33728bf074005aa426f1beac11d","head":{"label":"Baunsgaard:compressionTime","ref":"compressionTime","sha":"12cdc89a31d1b33728bf074005aa426f1beac11d","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":250787012,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTA3ODcwMTI=","name":"systemds","full_name":"Baunsgaard/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard/systemds","description":"Mirror

but found out that Levenshtein or Jaro distance could also be used, should I also add them? To compute Jaccard similarity between rows (strings) of a vector (nx1) the map with 2 args was added dist = map(Xi, \"(x, y) -> UtilFunctions.jaccardSim(x, y)\").\r\n\r\nI also modified discoverFD

PR includes the closed PR #1113 and all changes proposed in its comments. It was rebased on master and consolidated to make it easier to merge\r\n\r\nChanges list:\r\n- Added four new federated data partitioning schemes\r\n\t- ShuffleFederatedScheme\r\n\t- SubsampleToMinFederatedScheme\r\n\t- BalanceToAvgFederatedScheme\r\n\t- ReplicateToMaxFederatedScheme\r\n- Added runtime balancing parameter to parameter server (has a default parameter and is optional for the federated case)\r\n- Different runtime balancing schemes\r\n\t- RUN_MIN\r\n\t- CYCLE_AVG\r\n\t- CYCLE_MAX\r\n- Simplified the federated control thread to accommodate the coming N-batch frequency\r\n\t- There is now only one UDF, which computes a given number of batches. If more batches than the local epoch are specified it will cycle. This one function is sufficient for batch, N-Batch or Epoch Frequencies.\r\n- Provided a convenient way to create federated test matrices in the Automated Test Base\r\n- .getFedMapping() of FederationMap was refactored to getFRangeFDataMap to avoid confusion with the method of MatrixObject with the same name.\r\n- Updated and improved CNN.dml and TwoNN.dml scripts\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-18T17:10:18Z","updated_at":"2020-12-20T19:48:41Z","closed_at":"2020-12-20T19:48:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"05db532c8c4cb5955ece3263cafa5a955418491c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1131/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1131/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1131/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/dfcc62f008badd6c50c171f1aefcb68972624849","head":{"label":"tobiasrieger:balancing_and_data_partitioning","ref":"balancing_and_data_partitioning","sha":"dfcc62f008badd6c50c171f1aefcb68972624849","user":{"login":"tobiasrieger","id":39962737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTYyNzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39962737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger","html_url":"https://github.com/tobiasrieger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":284739507,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODQ3Mzk1MDc=","name":"systemds","full_name":"tobiasrieger/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tobiasrieger","id":39962737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTYyNzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39962737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger","html_url":"https://github.com/tobiasrieger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tobiasrieger/systemds","description":"Mirror
