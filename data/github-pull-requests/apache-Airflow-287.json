For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n   - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2203\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nImporting DAGS are terribly slow and operates at polynomial time (or worse). These changes bring huge performance boost for users who need have deep and wide dags. In the new toy example of a very basic Fan-In/Fan-Out x4 DAG found in `tests/dags/test_performance.py`, fails to compile in any reasonable timeframe using the original code. The following optimizations are employed:\r\n\r\n1. Defer detecting cycles of DAGs. Currently `detect_downstream_cycle` traverses the entire graph every time a task is added. Updated to call cycle detection only once when the DAG is collected by the `DagBag`. This is crucial because it reduces runtime from polynomial to near linear. Commit `8e8e735`\r\n2. Remove useless calls to `dag.tasks` in add_task command which iterates through every task needlessly for *every* task added. ~~Commit `013a7d2`~~\r\n3. Cache expensive `inspect.signature` call. Currently being called at every `BaseOperator/Operator` construction. We should be able to cache this because the function signature of the constructor isn't really expected to change. ~~Commit `a7b230e`~~\r\n4. ~~Use default `Resources` object for `BaseOperator` constructor. Currently every time an operator is constructed without specifying the `resources` parameter, a brand new `Resources` object is created that calls `configuration.getint()` 4x (to create `cpu/ram/disk/gpuResource`). A default declared `Resources` object can be shared for most tasks that don't need this functionality. Commit `6da941e`~~ Set default values for `Resources` object to be pulled from configuration. This changes from needing 4x configuration loads for every operator created to only 4x configuration loads to set the default values once.\r\n   * ~~*WARNING* potential breaking change! Because the default Resource object is shared among all operators (when none is specified). `Resources`'s internal `Resource` objects are assumed to be immutable (hence the change to getter access only). If a task needs to have its `resources` modified, the user must create a new one manually.~~\r\n5. Stop trigger/weight rules from recalculating the classes' static variables. ~~Commit `5d68744`~~\r\n6. Maintain tasks' `_upstream_task_ids` and `_downstream_task_ids` as sets instead of lists. Currently everytime a task is added, it iterates through the entire list to see if the task has already been added. There shouldn't be a need to do this.\r\n    * *WARNING* potential breaking change. The order in which a task is `set_downstream`/`set_upstream` is no longer preserved when retrieving the task list anymore. Order shouldn't have been an expected behavior to begin with, but just in case some people relied on that for some reason, they should be made aware.\r\n\r\nAn idea of the performance on my very old Haswell Laptop (in seconds):\r\n1. Deferred Cycle Detection- Compared with no cycle detection. Only adds a little more time and at least the DAG can now be loaded (compared to original)\r\n\r\n\r\nWidth | Tasks | Original | No Cycle Detection | Deferred Cycle Detection | All changes\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n25 | 105 | 6.67 | 0.312 | 0.373 | 0.234\r\n50 | 205 | 199 | 0.352 | 0.436 | 0.329\r\n100 | 405 | > 300 | 0.416 | 0.485 | 0.323\r\n200 | 805 | >300 | 0.65 | 0.648 | 0.367\r\n400 | 1605 | > 300 | 0.87 | 0.996 | 0.45\r\n800 | 3205 | > 300 | 1.53 | 1.77 | 0.534\r\n1600 | 6405 | > 300 | 3.24 | 3.86 | 0.773\r\n3200 | 12805 | > 300 | 9.47 | 11.25 | 1.12\r\n6400 | 25605 | > 300 | 36 | 42.43 | 2.18\r\n12800 | 51205 | > 300 | 151 | 163 | 3.77\r\n51200 | 204805 | > 300 |  >151 | > 163 | 14.75\r\n102300 | 409605 | > 300| > 151  | > 163 | 28.8\r\n\r\nFull benchmarks as each feature added can be found here:\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_39JRdPpXlWbWVM9jRVn7kBaIK7TshJllr5COC30Xeo/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- tests/utils/test_trigger_rule.py:TestTriggerRule\r\n- tests/utils/test_weight_rule.py:TestWeightRule\r\n- tests/utils/test_decorators.py:ApplyDefaultTest\r\n- test/utils.py:OperatorResourcesTest.test_unable_to_change_resource\r\n- tests/dags/test_performance.py\r\n- tests/models.py:DagTest.test_cycle\r\n- tests/models.py:DagBagTest.test_load_subdags\r\n- tests/models.py:DagBagTest.test_skip_cycle_dags\r\n- tests/models.py:DagBagTest.test_load_large_dag\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n   1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n   2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n   3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n   4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n   5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n   6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n~~Not yet, but I will. There are 6 different improvements that can be applied separately. I wasn't sure if they should each be individual PR's but they each contribute significantly to the performance boost. I kept them separate in case I needed to pull an individual change out of this PR. If everything checks out, I will squash them into one single commit.~~\r\n\r\nAs discussed on the PR below, I kept each of these features separate in a different commit (all prepended with [AIRFLOW-2203])\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2185\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nBoth the Google OAuth2 and GHE authentication plugins include the `next_url` as a query parameter in redirect_uri. This breaks at least Google OAuth2, unless you include the query parameter in the authorized redirection URI. This isn't the most flexible solution, as you would have to do the same for every potential next URL, and seems to go against the OAuth2 spec.\r\n\r\nInstead the next_url should be sent via the state parameter which MUST be maintained by all spec compliant OAuth2 implementations, and is not used when comparing redirection URIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n This is not easily unit testable, but I have tested it with Google OAuth2. Assuming GHE follows the OAuth2 spec, it should work there as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

It only contains file format changes to password_auth and test_password_endpoints converting from DOS to UNIX.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- I have re-run the unittests and confirmed the password_auth backend still works with this change (using the patch here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3048). Travis build/tests pass successfully.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

[AIRFLOW-2179](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2179/) \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe idea is to be able to choose where tp bind the subprocess local webserver log files, for example

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-102\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nExceptions from on_success_callback are stomped on, meaning\r\ntest_complex_template would never fail.\r\n\r\nRather than follow the \"success = True\" pattern (which results in the\r\nlovely-to-track-down error message of `AssertionError: False is not\r\ntrue` I instead changed all these to have the verify method be execute\r\n-- meaning exceptions are propagated unchanged.\r\n\r\nThanks to @sekikn in https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2375 for the info to track down what was going on. Sorry for not merging that as is -- I think this is a less fragile solution.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: Can't write tests for tests. I did manually change the test cases to see that they all fail with sensible error messages, and they do:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n      File \"/Users/ash/code/python/incubator-airflow/tests/core.py\", line 492, in verify_templated_field\r\n        context['ds'])\r\n    AssertionError: 'a2015-01-01' != '2015-01-01'\r\n    - a2015-01-01\r\n    ? -\r\n    + 2015-01-01\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-05T22:34:45Z","updated_at":"2018-03-10T14:19:01Z","closed_at":"2018-03-10T14:18:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fb0bd02e0d7e5046624f5e88c160e600516b30e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3100/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3100/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3100/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/6b2633c9077afc9645276c959090b80da7df5645","head":{"label":"ashb:template_tests_always_succeed","ref":"template_tests_always_succeed","sha":"6b2633c9077afc9645276c959090b80da7df5645","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94879701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDg3OTcwMQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"ashb/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ashb/airflow","description":"Apache

JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2173\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently the concurrency reached check does a filter in the DB query to only include tasks that are currently in the parsed DAG. For sufficiently large DAGs with many tasks, this causes mysql to use an inefficient query plan and can put a lot of load on the database. Since there is no good reason to omit old running tasks in a DAG from concurrency, this filter should just be removed.\r\n\r\nThere are some instances of this pattern that can and should be removed, but this is the one that had a significant impact on DB performance.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nRunning on Airbnb infrastructure for several days, with a significant decrease in DB load, all unit tests pass.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n\r\n@saguziel

JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2168) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2168\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n        This PR creates the wasb_task_handler for remote logging using Azure Blob Storage. Besides that, it improves wasb_hook adding capabilities to download and read files from Azure Blob Storage.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n        adds new tests to airflow.contrib.hooks.wasb_hook.py.\r\n        for the airflow.utils.log.wasb_task_handler.py unfortunately I would need a true Azure account in order to create tests.  \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [AIRFLOW-2167](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2167) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-2167] cleanup nonexistent dags on the first iteration in addition to periodically\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2167\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n  - This PR tweaks `airflow/jobs.py` to cleanup nonexistent import errors on the first iteration of the scheuduler and periodically as defined by `dag_dir_list_interval`.  This way, a scheduler setup with a small number of runs will still have old errors cleaned up.\r\n  - Previously, a scheduler would only run this cleanup after the number of seconds in `dag_dir_list_interval` had elapsed.  For schedulers defined with a small number of runs, this meant the cleanup never occurred.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - extremely good reason:  This is a very minor code tweak.  No new functionality is added, existing functionality is only triggered one additional time.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-02T20:47:05Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T16:27:10Z","closed_at":"2019-09-11T16:27:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b472e6143b3e3e480eb849fd6b63ba62497505a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow-2150](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2150) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2150\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently HiveMetastoreHook().max_partition() make calls to `self.metastore.get_partitions()`, which is extremely expensive for large tables. This change will call self.metastore.get_partition_names() instead to get the max partition.\r\n\r\nRemoving `filter` from the method signatures as it will not be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nOnly bug fixing. Tested on local branch.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-01T06:32:48Z","updated_at":"2018-03-08T05:02:30Z","closed_at":"2018-03-08T00:13:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8638c4fff15827ccbfc71b21abd204b8591b2214","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3082/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3082/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3082/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/71a462f359d2640fa29963c7e6568173b0619604","head":{"label":"KevinYang21:kevin_yang_fix_hive_max_partition","ref":"kevin_yang_fix_hive_max_partition","sha":"71a462f359d2640fa29963c7e6568173b0619604","user":{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":106481430,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDY0ODE0MzA=","name":"airflow","full_name":"KevinYang21/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2160\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen there is a dot in a task's ID or in its execution date, changing its state from the UI fails.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that Flask-Admin's iterencode function encodes composite primary keys using dot as the escape symbol. If there is already a dot in any of the values, it is doubled.\r\n\r\nOn decoding however, Airflow is currently just splitting the string on a comma.\r\n\r\nThis PR switches to using Flask-Admin's iterdecode to correctly decode task instance rowids when they contain a dot.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo new functionality\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-28T22:09:46Z","updated_at":"2018-03-02T22:36:48Z","closed_at":"2018-03-01T07:48:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f50a91e460ee1dfd0558b292fcce22fa48f89785","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3081/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3081/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3081/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/f6a3d7c44574fed2332b86a8de00b32b7ca00c9a","head":{"label":"cmlad:fix-bad-rowid-deserialization","ref":"fix-bad-rowid-deserialization","sha":"f6a3d7c44574fed2332b86a8de00b32b7ca00c9a","user":{"login":"cmlad","id":4784906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ5MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad","html_url":"https://github.com/cmlad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100626985,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MjY5ODU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"cmlad/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmlad","id":4784906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ5MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad","html_url":"https://github.com/cmlad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmlad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmlad/airflow","description":"Apache

required both BaseOperator and BaseSensorOperator\r\nto be included in its `operators` attribute. I added a `sensors`\r\nattribute and updated import logic so that anything added to\r\nthe new attribute can be imported from\r\n`airflow.sensors.{plugin_name}`\r\n\r\nThe integration/`make_module` calls in `airflow.plugins_manager`\r\nfor operators is also updated to maintain the ability to import\r\nsensors from `operators` to avoid breaking existing plugins\r\n\r\nUpdated unit tests and documentation to reflect this\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2147\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n  - Adds attribute `AirflowPlugin.sensors` so they can be imported like `from airflow.sensors.test_plugin \r\n    import PluginSensorOperator` instead of having to put both operators and sensors under `AirflowPlugin.operators`\r\n  - Updates `plugins.rst` to reflect this\r\n  - Doesn't break existing plugins- sensors can still be imported as usual\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - `tests/plugins/test_plugin.py`: Adds `PluginSensorOperator` to the examples\r\n  - `tests/plugins_manager.py`: Adds import test for `PluginSensorOperator`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n  - Doesn't pass `airflow/__init__.py` because it required adding an import which triggers _module level import not at top of file_ messages, which isn't actually a new warning if you run it without the diff (I'm guessing it was ignored before so the diff triggers it again). This also causes the Travis CI build to fail on this flake8 step. Not sure how to get around it, but you can see in the diff that the two added lines follow the surrounding style

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n## JIRA\r\n\r\n- [x]   My PR addresses the following Airflow JIRA issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n[AIRFLOW-2110] Enhance Http Hook to use a header in passed in the \"extra\" argument and add tenacity retry\"\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2122\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n- [x]  Add possibility to add a json header in the \"extra\" field in the connection:\r\n{\"Authorization\": \"Bearer Here1sMyT0k3N\"}\r\nAlso add tenacity retry so the operator won't fall over in case of a connection issue.\r\nHere are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn the original hook we could not skip raise for status, pass headers from the \"extra\" field in the airflow UI and would immediately fail on connection error. Now in case of connection error the hook will retry 7 times with exponential backoff, the \"raise for status\" method can be skipped and can pass a JSON header in the extra field in the UI.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\n- [x]  My PR adds the following unit tests OR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntest_raise_for_status_with_200\r\ntest_get_request_do_not_raise_for_status_if_check_response_is_false\r\ntest_hook_contains_header_from_extra_field\r\ntest_hook_uses_provided_header\r\ntest_hook_has_no_header_from_extra\r\ntest_hooks_header_from_extra_is_overridden\r\ntest_post_request\r\ntest_post_request_with_error_code\r\ntest_post_request_do_not_raise_for_status_if_check_response_is_false\r\ntest_retry_on_conn_error\r\ntest_header_from_extra_and_run_method_are_merged\r\n\r\n## Commits \r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"How to write a good git commit message\":\r\n\r\nSubject is separated from body by a blank line\r\nSubject is limited to 50 characters\r\nSubject does not end with a period\r\nSubject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\nBody wraps at 72 characters\r\nBody explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x]  Passes git diff

#2138 closes #AIRFLOW-2138\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2138\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n   - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2138\r\n- Add support for wildcards to be provided in source object argument\r\nThis allows the user of the Operator to provide a wildcard in the format accepted by the documentation. This message is echoed in the docstring for ease of use, and also because it is only three sentences and adding a link is not required.\r\n- Add an argument move_object (bool) to the operator that, when true runs a mv command  as opposed to a cp command. That is to say, it moves an object instead of copying the object. This is especially useful when this operator is used to move objects in the same bucket, perhaps from folder to folder.\r\n- Add dotmodus and dannylee12 to companies using airflow\r\nWe use airflow in almost all of our projects.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Unit tests have been added, they acheive what they set out to acheive. All other elements are tested previously. This PR does not change any functionality of the underlying hooks, but rather extends how they can be used.\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. \r\nNot sure how to squash commits? \r\nIn addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-22T15:13:48Z","updated_at":"2018-03-09T21:24:36Z","closed_at":"2018-03-09T21:23:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa9968d7a3bd0ce7881ba332e70438b297c74cfa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3067/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3067/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3067/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/24b22bfeb015a3c19cfbd088267e45839963388c","head":{"label":"DannyLee12:master","ref":"master","sha":"24b22bfeb015a3c19cfbd088267e45839963388c","user":{"login":"DannyLee12","id":20240676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjQwNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20240676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12","html_url":"https://github.com/DannyLee12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":122493888,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjI0OTM4ODg=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"DannyLee12/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DannyLee12","id":20240676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjQwNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20240676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12","html_url":"https://github.com/DannyLee12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DannyLee12/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2137\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2138\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2137\r\n    - Allows a wildcard to be provided in the source_objects field. \r\n   - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2138\r\n   - Add support wildcards to be provided in the GoogleCloudStorageToGoogleCloudStorage operator.\r\n    - Add a new argument move_object that, when set deletes the file, allowing this operator to work more as a mv command than a cp command if required.\r\n\r\n    - As this wildcard expansion allows multiple files to be copied/moved, the destination argument becomes the name of the folder to which the files are copied into.\r\nTherefore, these files are not renamed once copied/moved, but rather retain their original names.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n   All items of this pr are tested previously. This PR does not change any functionality of the underlying   hooks, but rather extends how they can be used. Therefore, writing new tests is deemed unnecessary.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. \r\nNot sure how to squash commits? \r\nIn addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-22T09:29:39Z","updated_at":"2018-02-22T14:22:37Z","closed_at":"2018-02-22T14:22:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7c35edfbe7d1b3f2b12bdc84b061319355f2bdc4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3065/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3065/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3065/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/405d3b6df3920951f0f8b5569901a36278f7cd1c","head":{"label":"DannyLee12:master","ref":"master","sha":"405d3b6df3920951f0f8b5569901a36278f7cd1c","user":{"login":"DannyLee12","id":20240676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjQwNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20240676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12","html_url":"https://github.com/DannyLee12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DannyLee12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f30253cb3ee6996185891c9765b5eda86bf0a368","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2131\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe generated API documentation includes `automodule` declarations for several modules (hooks and operators) that end up pulling in docs from `airflow.utils.helpers.AirflowImporter`.\r\n\r\nThis leads to the confusing situation for new users who think they're reading docs about what Hooks are, but are instead reading unlabeled docs about the seemingly-deprecated AirflowImporter. (See Jira issue for screenshot)\r\n\r\nThis PR removes these `automodule` imports and adds a sentence paraphrased from the Concepts docs about what Hooks are.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAll docs, all the time.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-21T01:20:33Z","updated_at":"2018-02-23T03:40:39Z","closed_at":"2018-02-23T03:40:39Z","merged_at":"2018-02-23T03:40:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"331a1dc0fcfc75ff5a132b1fb9a1d817b47de974","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3062/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3062/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3062/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/331a1dc0fcfc75ff5a132b1fb9a1d817b47de974","head":{"label":"reidab:AIRFLOW-2131","ref":"AIRFLOW-2131","sha":"331a1dc0fcfc75ff5a132b1fb9a1d817b47de974","user":{"login":"reidab","id":13192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab","html_url":"https://github.com/reidab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":122271925,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjIyNzE5MjU=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"reidab/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"reidab","id":13192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab","html_url":"https://github.com/reidab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/reidab/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2130\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-951 (earlier issue with a narrower scope)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n    * Fix autodoc import path for BaseSensorOperator\r\n    * Add autodoc imports for many core & contrib Operators that were missing\r\n    * Rename \"Operator API\" section to \"Core Operators\" for better contrast with the following \"Community-contributed Operators\" section\r\n    * Add subheadings to API Reference#Operators. Since all the Sensors were already alphabetized separately from the rest of the operators, this formalizes that distinction and moves all the Transfer operators to their own section as well.\r\n    * Alphabetize Operator class names\r\n    * Improve formatting in top-level Operators section\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nIt's all docs, all the time. Arguably, there should be some kind of tests that ensure newly-added Operators are all added to the docs, but that's outside the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`","created_at":"2018-02-21T01:15:48Z","updated_at":"2018-02-23T15:32:07Z","closed_at":"2018-02-23T15:32:07Z","merged_at":"2018-02-23T15:32:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"3e32819d85acca4413d2d7d4bcd814c4c9af3241","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3061/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3061/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3061/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/3e32819d85acca4413d2d7d4bcd814c4c9af3241","head":{"label":"reidab:AIRFLOW-2130","ref":"AIRFLOW-2130","sha":"3e32819d85acca4413d2d7d4bcd814c4c9af3241","user":{"login":"reidab","id":13192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab","html_url":"https://github.com/reidab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":122271925,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjIyNzE5MjU=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"reidab/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"reidab","id":13192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab","html_url":"https://github.com/reidab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/reidab/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2127.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPython's `logging.config.fileConfig` function will, by default, disable all existing loggers when it is called. The `fileConfig` function is used with default arguments by Airflow during Alembic migrations and disables all loggers except those from alembic and sqlalchemy (this includes disabling Airflow's own loggers). This change sets the `disable_existing_loggers` flag of `fileConfig` to `False` so that it _does not_ disable any existing loggers, allowing them to continue working as normal.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis is an extremely limited change that I expect to be exercised by existing tests (if not explicitly tested).\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4.

JIRA\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2125\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe wheel package `psycopg` was deprecated on version 2.7.4: http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/news.html\r\nA new package with its dependencies was build: `psycopg2-binary`\r\n\r\nThe Airflow is printing an WARNING when using the old package:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nUserWarning: The psycopg2 wheel package will be renamed from release 2.8; in order to keep installing from binary please use \"pip install psycopg2-binary\" instead. For details see: <http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/install.html#binary-install-from-pypi>.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe recommendation is to build the source: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2-binary\r\n\r\n**Warning The psycopg2 wheel package comes packaged, among the others, with its own libssl binary. This may create conflicts with other extension modules binding with libssl as well, for instance with the Python ssl module: in some cases, under concurrency, the interaction between the two libraries may result in a segfault. In case of doubts you are advised to use a package built from source.**\r\n\r\nThis pull request forces to use `psycopg2-binary` 2.7.4 or superior.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nThere is no tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-19T16:52:42Z","updated_at":"2019-01-07T20:30:28Z","closed_at":"2018-02-24T15:16:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"58e62e9acaca27569ae7650452afc5a8b650f1ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3055/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3055/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3055/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/365eb1ac9e11e17fc3101da4123764cb60c56933","head":{"label":"bern4rdelli:AIRFLOW-2125","ref":"AIRFLOW-2125","sha":"365eb1ac9e11e17fc3101da4123764cb60c56933","user":{"login":"bern4rdelli","id":11928589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTI4NTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11928589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli","html_url":"https://github.com/bern4rdelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":78529342,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3ODUyOTM0Mg==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"bern4rdelli/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bern4rdelli","id":11928589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTI4NTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11928589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli","html_url":"https://github.com/bern4rdelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bern4rdelli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bern4rdelli/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

JIRA\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2103\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe change https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2730 broke the `password_auth` login:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/bin/airflow\", line 6, in <module>\r\n    exec(compile(open(_file).read(), __file_, 'exec'))\r\n  File

`login_required` and `logout_user` to be referenced on `password_auth.py`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-800\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n- `airflow initdb` creates a connection with `conn_id='bigquery_default'` and `conn_type='bigquery'`. However, bigquery is not a valid `conn_type`, according to `models.Connection._types`, and BigQuery connections should use the google_cloud_platform conn_type.\r\n    - Changed the connection to `GoogleCloudBaseHook` instead of `BigQueryHook` which was causing an invalid `conn_type` creation during `airflow initdb`\r\n    - Modified `GoogleCloudBaseHook` to change the name of parameter `conn_id` to keep it consistent with other Hooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo new code added\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following:\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-610\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n  - This PR is a more or less a rebase of https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/1862\r\n  - The command versions of config parameters were overridden by the\r\ndefault config. E.g `sql_alchemy_conn` got the default value even\r\nwhen `sql_alchemy_conn_cmd` was specified. \r\n -  This PR makes the AirflowConfigParser only look at the default values last by having a separate instance of ConfigParser containing the default values.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n - `tests/configuration.py:ConfTest.test_command_config`\r\n - `tests/configuration.py:ConfTest.test_remove_option`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-11T14:28:58Z","updated_at":"2018-04-16T12:03:54Z","closed_at":"2018-04-16T08:13:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0f002ce474d9de750d3afeb3f51d817729b88f60","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3029/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3029/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3029/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/a9d471b8ec792191f6c329bb4e9685d86e06ea92","head":{"label":"tictail:airflow-610","ref":"airflow-610","sha":"a9d471b8ec792191f6c329bb4e9685d86e06ea92","user":{"login":"tictail","id":546817,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU0NjgxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/546817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail","html_url":"https://github.com/tictail","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":120898943,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjA4OTg5NDM=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"tictail/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tictail","id":546817,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU0NjgxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/546817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail","html_url":"https://github.com/tictail","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tictail/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tictail/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

all,\r\nThis PR is to add a Spark JDBC hook/operator pair. I've personally started using it to replace \r\nSqoop, and have found it much more stable and reliable. Thought it would be nice to make it\r\navailable to the community. Curious to hear your thoughts.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [AIRFLOW-2085](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2085) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2085\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAdd the Spark JDBC hook/operator pair. This pair extends\r\nthe existing SparkSubmitOperator. Also includes the\r\nspark_jdbc_script, which is the actual Spark job that is run.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: Tests included for both the spark_jdbc_hook and the spark_jdbc_operator.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-09T07:33:22Z","updated_at":"2018-02-10T16:20:14Z","closed_at":"2018-02-10T16:20:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"29036eaf48294f0d44bf38525e83ad8529f1d23b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3021/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3021/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3021/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/13b5c5618beaaebf025a5d49afacfda8d6945677","head":{"label":"danielvdende:AIRFLOW-2085-add-spark-jdbc-operator","ref":"AIRFLOW-2085-add-spark-jdbc-operator","sha":"13b5c5618beaaebf025a5d49afacfda8d6945677","user":{"login":"danielvdende","id":4234426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzQ0MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4234426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende","html_url":"https://github.com/danielvdende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62139910,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjEzOTkxMA==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"danielvdende/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"danielvdende","id":4234426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzQ0MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4234426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende","html_url":"https://github.com/danielvdende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/danielvdende/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2073 FileSensor always return True\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Previously it never returned False because os.walk never failed.\r\n\r\n    It also wasn't clear the behaviour of this sensor should have when given\r\na directory. I think the most useful behaviour would be to wait for any\r\nfiles to exist, rather than returning as soon as the directory itself\r\nexists.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests: more tests to tests.contrib.sensors.file_test_sensor\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.
