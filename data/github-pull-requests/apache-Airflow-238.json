https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8166\r\n\r\n- Replace usage of `DAG._schedule_interval` with `DAG.normalized_schedule_interval`. This will even allow users to tests that they set correct Cron Preset in unit tests (instead of using an internal property before)\r\n- Added tests for Schedule Interval & Normalized Schedule Interval\r\n- Also solves the issue mentioned in https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8166\r\n- Removes confusion between `schedule_interval` and `_schedule_interval`\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to

PR upgrades `azure-storage-blob`  and `azure-storage-file-share` to the latest versions(v12).\r\nThese versions are not backward compatible with the current version(v2) that airflow uses, so there are lots of changes that are not backward compatible which I have included in the UPDATING.md.\r\n\r\nIt turns out snowflake-connector-python is causing boto3 conflict which I later saw in their [issues](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/issues/290) and also still using `azure-storage-blob` [version 2](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/blob/master/tested_requirements/requirements_36.txt).\r\n\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x]

migration was added in #7217 had a few problems that could cause us trouble in the\nfuture:\n\n1. It was importing the live model definition, which could break in the\n   future (if for instance it ever got a new column added, when this\n   migration runs it would try to use that new definition, but the\n   column won't exist yet).\n2. It was selecting the (large) `data` column needlessly\n3. It was dropping and re-creating the index but that is only needed on\n   MSSQL, not for MySQL or Postgresql.\n\n\n---\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\n\n- [x] Description

[AIRFLOW-6515](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6515), I executed the following to get a list of potential errors logged with the info or warn level:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrep -iE 'log\\.(info|warn).*(error|exceptio|fail|unab|couldn|lost|gone|missing|not fou|abort|exit|could not)' -R *\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, I also ran the following\r\n```\r\ngrep -iE 'log\\.(info|warn).*(unav)' -R *\r\ngrep -iE 'log\\.(info|warn).*(not p)' -R *\r\ngrep -iE 'log\\.(info|warn).*(invalid)' -R *\r\n```\r\n\r\nI changed what I thought were errors to use the error log level. I also changed one or two info entries to warn log level.\r\n\r\nThe above GREP commands still return some matches but I believe those are likely false positives.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the

to resolve [[AIRFLOW-7049]](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-7049) by replacing the problematic \"show/hide paused DAGs\" toggle with a more robust status filter that saves and persists the user's selection.\r\n\r\nStatus Filter:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/78398505-2d74f900-75c1-11ea-8258-20f357917ded.png)\r\n\r\nIn context of the DAGs (home)

If the preexisting webserver variable `hide_paused_dags_by_default` is set to `True`, the default is \"active\".\r\n- The currently selected status will always be saved in `flask_session[FILTER_STATUS_COOKIE]`. Value of `all`, `active`, or `paused`.\r\n- A status param in the URL will always override and resave the cookie value. e.g. `/home?status=active`\r\n- If a user leaves the page and returns to `/home`, the last saved cookie value will be selected.\r\n\r\nOf note:\r\n\r\n- The status filter buttons include a number count correlating to the number of DAGs for each.\r\n- Status params are passed along within the pagination links\r\n- The `dags.html` diff is so large because I fixed a bunch of indentation while I was in there.\r\n\r\nTests:\r\n\r\n- Added a view test to confirm URL parameter values are saving to cookie value.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Unit tests coverage for changes (not needed for documentation changes)\r\n- [x] Commits follow \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\"\r\n- [x] Relevant documentation is updated including usage instructions.\r\n- [x] I will engage committers as explained in [Contribution Workflow Example](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#contribution-workflow-example).\r\n\r\n---\r\nIn case of fundamental code change, Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in [UPDATING.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md).\r\nRead the [Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines) for more information.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-03T20:25:50Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T16:16:16Z","closed_at":"2020-04-09T16:41:31Z","merged_at":"2020-04-09T16:41:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"1317cdc63546a35ad9cf229f9026ac0d08f01dfb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172800850,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwODUw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:improvement","name":"type:improvement","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Improvements"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

generated for providers.yandex.hooks incorrectly include docs for airflow.exceptions.AirflowException and airflow.hooks.base_hook.BaseHook in the yandex module, as if those classes had been defined in that module.\r\n\r\nThis is almost certainly a bug in autoapi or one of the libraries it uses, but I haven't tracked down the root cause. In the meantime, importing the modules and then referring to the classes using modulename.Classname avoids the issue.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: based on advice from the community, instead of changing the way modules were imported in `providers.yandex.hooks.__init__`, reorganize the code similar to how other providers are organized to keep code out of `__init__`. \r\n\r\nBefore this change, yandex docs include AirflowException and BaseHook under the wrong fully qualified names:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"763\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-03-28 at 4 36 56 PM\"

in and of itself, these docs being out of place are causing doc warnings in another PR where I have added `airflow.exceptions` to the api docs

the jira issue states (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5500), the experimental api is broken when one tries to trigger a dag that contains nested subdags.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that calling `dag.subdags` returns a list of ALL the subdags for the dag (even the nested ones), instead of the direct child subdags.\r\n(here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/models/dag.py#L756)\r\n\r\nMy fix directly changes the trigger_dag.py, but a better solution is probably to make `dag.subdags` return only the child subdags. I didn't know if the current behaviour was chosen for a specific reason so I decided to just change the experimental api.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR:
