Problem\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16073\r\n\r\nThe consumer will receive 'OutOfRangeException' in the following case:\r\n\r\nIn a specific concurrent scenario, imagine sequential offsets: offset1 < offset2 < offset3. A client requests data at offset2. While a background deletion process removes segments from memory, it hasn't yet updated the LocalLogStartOffset from offset1 to offset3. Consequently, when the fetch offset (offset2) is evaluated against the stale offset1 in ReplicaManager.handleOffsetOutOfRangeError, it incorrectly triggers an OffsetOutOfRangeException. This issue arises from the out-of-sync update of localLogStartOffset, leading to incorrect handling of consumer fetch requests and potential data access errors.\r\n\r\nSummarizing the example scenario from the JIRA [comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16073?focusedCommentId=17801663&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-17801663) \r\n\r\nLet us assume each segment has one offset in this example:\r\nlog start offset 0\r\nlog end offset 10\r\nlocal log start offset 4\r\nfetch offset 6\r\nnew local log start offset 7\r\n\r\nDeletion based on retention configs is started and eventually updating the local log start offset as 7.\r\n\r\nThere is a race condition here where the segments list is updated by removing 4, 5, and 6 offset segments in LocalLog and then updates the local-log-start-offset. But fetch offset is being served concurrently and it may throw OffsetOutOfRangeException if the inmemory segments are already removed in LocalLog and local-log-start-offset is not yet updated as 7 when it executes the [code](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/ReplicaManager.scala#L1866) as it fails the condition because fetch offset(6) < old local-log-start-offset(4).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

originally was https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/14489 which covered 2 aspects -- reloading on partition epoch changes where leader epoch did not change and reloading when leader epoch changed but we were already the leader. \r\n\r\nI've cut out the second part of the change since the first part is much simpler.\r\n\r\nRedefining the TopicDelta fields to better distinguish when a leader is elected (leader epoch bump) vs when a leader has isr/replica changes (partition epoch bump). There are some cases where we bump the partition epoch but not the leader epoch. We do not need to do operations that only care about the leader epoch bump.

KIP-892: Transactional Semantics for StateStores[1] for a detailed explanation of the design.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWrites to StateStores are now isolated from the underlying RocksDB database until the changelog transaction has been committed. We do this by writing first to a RocksDB `WriteBatchWithIndex`, which on-commit will be written to the RocksDB database.\r\n\r\nNow that writes to a StateStore are isolated by a \"transaction buffer\" (`WriteBatchWithIndex`), we can also isolate them from interactive query threads. We introduce a new configuration,\r\n`default.state.isolation.level`, which defaults to `READ_UNCOMMITTED` to provide the existing behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhen `processing.mode` is set to `exactly-once(-v2|-beta)`, the default swtiches to `READ_COMMITTED`, as this will be the desired behaviour for the vast majority of use-cases.\r\n\r\nCrucially, this ensures that in the event of an error, state stores no longer need to be wiped under EOS, unless the user has explicitly selected the `READ_UNCOMMITTED` isolation level.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo ensure consistency, we now store offsets in a secondary column-family in RocksDB (`__offsets`). These offsets are updated on-commit. We guarantee that the `__offsets` memtables and data memtables are flushed atomically, together, using RocksDB's Atomic Flush. This allows us to remove the explicit `flush()` calls that previously forcibly flushed memtables to disk. RocksDB now entirely controls memtable flush behaviour via its configuration.\r\n\r\nWe continue writing offsets to the `.checkpoint` file, to ensure that during rebalance, we can send offsets for currently closed stores, without having to open them just to read their offset. The `.checkpoint` file is only updated on store close for this reason. If the store is open, the currently in-memory offset is used instead.\r\n\r\nWe also keep the `.checkpoint` file for custom `StateStore` implementations that do not manage their own offsets. For these stores, the legacy behaviour will still be used.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe performance should be at least as good, if not better, than before, as batched writes to RocksDB avoid locking the memtable for every write.\r\n\r\n1:

describes failure scenarios around replica directory being altered and a log directory/broker crashing.\r\n\r\nIt is observed that for scenario (3), i.e. a broker crashes while it waits for the future replica to catch up for the second time and the `dir1` is unavailable when the broker is restarted, the broker tries to create the partition in `dir2` according to the metadata in the controller. However, ReplicaManager also tries to resume the stale future replica which was abandoned when the broker crashed. This results in the renaming of the future replica to fail eventually because the directory for the topic partition already exists in `dir2` and the broker then marks `dir2` as offline.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to fix this behaviour by ignoring any future replicas which are in the same directory as where the log exists. It further marks the stale future replica for deletion.\r\n\r\nEdit: Instead of removing the abandoned future replica, I've adopted Proven's suggestion to rename the future replica instead and avoid the creation of a new replica in `dir2`.\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-05T11:41:37Z","updated_at":"2024-04-19T20:18:51Z","closed_at":"2024-04-19T20:18:51Z","merged_at":"2024-04-19T20:18:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"0308543d596d564b68dcac371a8e3af69e06caea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15136/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15136/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/15136/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/3d78e5567fd16aa77f0b9f8c510ad26f0e6443c6","head":{"label":"gaurav-narula:KAFKA-16082","ref":"KAFKA-16082","sha":"3d78e5567fd16aa77f0b9f8c510ad26f0e6443c6","user":{"login":"gaurav-narula","id":97168911,"node_id":"U_kgDOBcquDw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97168911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula","html_url":"https://github.com/gaurav-narula","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":661108534,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ2e3Ng","name":"kafka","full_name":"gaurav-narula/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaurav-narula","id":97168911,"node_id":"U_kgDOBcquDw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97168911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula","html_url":"https://github.com/gaurav-narula","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-narula/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaurav-narula/kafka","description":"Mirror

expiring inflight requests, the network client does not take throttle time into account. If a connection has multiple inflight requests (default of 5) and each request is throttled then some of the requests can incorrectly marked as expired. Subsequently the connection is closed and the client establishes a new connection to the broker. This behavior leads to unnecessary connections to the broker, leads to connection storms and increases latencies. \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

What\r\nThe PR fixes the publishing of `kafka-clients` artifact to remote maven. The `kafka-clients` jar is recently been shadowed which does publish the artifacts to local maven successfully but errors when publishing to remote maven. The issue triggers only with `publishMavenJavaPublicationToMavenRepository` and `signing` but `publishToMavenLocal` works correctly with earlier changes. Generating signed `asc` files error out for shadowed release artifacts as the module name (`clients`) differs from the artifact name (`kafka-clients`).\r\n\r\nThe fix is basically to explicitly define `artifact` of `shadowJar` to `signing` and `publish` plugin. `project.shadow.component(mavenJava)` previously outputs the name as `client-<version>-all.jar` though the `classifier` and `archivesBaseName` are already defined correctly in `:clients` and `shadowJar` construction. \r\n\r\nBelow is another way where the artifact details can be overridden post construction in `afterEvaluate` to let `publish` plugin know about the correct `artifactId` but it doesn't solve the `signing` plugin issue where `signing` plugin is unaware of `kafka-client-<version>.jar` and skips signing. For `signing` plugin the `artifact` should be explicitly defined as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n            project.shadow.component(mavenJava)\r\n        \r\n            afterEvaluate {\r\n              pom.withXml {\r\n                asNode().dependencies.dependency.findAll() {\r\n                  def projectName = it.artifactId.text()\r\n                  if (['clients'].contains(projectName)) {\r\n                    it.artifactId*.value = 'kafka-clients'\r\n                  }\r\n                }\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n```  \r\n\r\n## Tests:\r\n- I created person `gpg` secrets locally for signing and private maven repo to upload the artifacts. I ran the release pipeline pointing to custom repo and can successfully push the `kafka-clients` artifacts.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-01-04 at 3 46 06 PM](https://github.com/apache/kafka/assets/2861565/e8f71eb9-905f-4838-afa1-99929d613e2d)\r\n\r\n- Testing shaded dependencies generated successfully. I can see no difference in the previous and release shaded jars, and can also see shaded dependencies in the jar.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-01-04 at 3 50 11 PM](https://github.com/apache/kafka/assets/2861565/e334e51c-ec00-419a-97a1-62c0315bfefe)\r\n\r\n## Query:\r\n\r\n- I compared the 3.6.1 kafka release artifacts [here](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/kafka/kafka-clients/3.6.1/) with generated artifacts in my personal repo, and can find `module` metadata artifact is missing. Debugged the issue and it seems `gradle publish` - `from components.java` actually registers both `jar` and `module` for publish which is not there in case of `shadowJar` hence the question is that do we require to publish `module` metadata information or are we good?\r\n\r\ncc: @stanislavkozlovski @xvrl @AndrewJSchofield\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

We ask the state updater to give back the task, add a pending action to close the task clean once it’s handed back\r\n 3. We get a new assignment with updated input partitions. The task is still owned by the state updater, so we ask the state updater again to hand it back and add a pending action to update its input partition\r\n 4. The task is handed back by the state updater. We update its input partitions but forget to close it clean (pending action was overwritten)\r\n 5. Now the task is in an initialized state, but the underlying producer does not have transactions initialized\r\n\r\nThis can cause an IllegalStateException: `Invalid transition attempted from state UNINITIALIZED to state IN_TRANSACTION` when running in EOSv2.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we introduce a new pending action CloseReviveAndUpdateInputPartitions that is added when we handle a new assignment with updated input partitions, but we still need to close the task before reopening it.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-03T18:11:21Z","updated_at":"2024-01-05T18:32:34Z","closed_at":"2024-01-05T18:32:33Z","merged_at":"2024-01-05T18:32:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"c0b649345580e4dfb2ebb88d3aaace71afe70d75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null},{"id":5512529316,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABSJKFpA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/backport-candidate","name":"backport-candidate","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"This

WIP - fixing test cases\r\n### Notes:\r\n- [x]  Moving any object companion and interfaces that KafkaConfigs depends on outside of core. \r\n  - `Session`, and `SocketServer ` moved to `org.apache.kafka.network`\r\n  - `AuthorizerUtils` moved to `org.apache.kafka.security.utils`\r\n  - `KafkaRaftServer`, `PasswordEncoder`  moved to `org.apache.kafka.server`\r\n  - `ClientQuotaManagerConfig`, `DynamicConfig`, `ReplicationQuotaManagerConfig`  moved to `org.apache.kafka.server.config`\r\n  - `LogCleaner` moved to `org.apache.kafka.server.config.LogCleanerConfig`. It can't move to `storage` without creating Circular dependency. \r\n  - `TransactionLogConfig` moved to `org.apache.kafka.coordinator.transaction`\r\n  - `OffsetConfig` moved to `org.apache.kafka.coordinator.group`\r\n  - some of `CoreUtils` functionality is duplicated in `org.apache.kafka.utils`\r\n  - some of `TestUtils` functionality is duplicated in `org.apache.kafka.server.utils`\r\n\r\n- [x] Introduce interfaces to reduce moving dependencies out of core and reduce the changes in this pr\r\n  - `ReconfigurableServer` to avoid depending on `Broker` and `Controller` \r\n  - `DynamicBrokerConfigManager` and `DynamicBrokerConfigBaseManager` to avoid depending directly on `DynamicBrokerConfig` \r\n  - `KafkaZKClient` to avoid any depend ices on `KafaZKClient`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

attempt to update lags when in state PENDING_SHUTDOWN or PARTITIONS_REVOKED. In these states, however, our representation of the assignment may not be up-to-date with the subscription object inside the consumer. This can cause a bug, in particular, when we subscribe to a set of topics via a regular expression and the underlying topic is deleted. The consumer subscription may reflect that topic deletion already, while our internal state still contains references to the deleted topic, because `onAssignment` has not yet been executed. Therefore, we will attempt to call `currentLag` on partitions that are not assigned to us any more inside the consumer, leading to an `IllegalStateException`.\r\n\r\nThis bug causes flakiness of the

describes the race condition sequence in detail. When this occurs, it can cause the impacted task's initializing to block indefinitely, blocking progress on the impacted task, and any other task assigned to the same stream thread. The fix I have implemented is pretty simple, simply re-check whether a directory is still empty after locking it during the start of rebalancing, and if it is, unlock it immediately. This preserves the idempotency of the method when it coincides with parallel state store cleanup executions.\r\n\r\nTested using `./gradlew streams:test`. I also tested replicating the race condition, and validated that with this fix, task initializing does not get blocked.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify

originally did some refactors in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/14774, but we decided to keep the changes minimal since the ticket was a blocker. Here are those refactors:\r\n\r\n* Removed separate append paths so that produce, group coordinator, and other append paths all call appendRecords\r\n* appendRecords has been simplified\r\n* Removed unneeded error conversions in verification code since group coordinator and produce path convert errors differently, removed test for that\r\n* Fixed incorrect capital param name in KafkaRequestHandler\r\n* Updated ReplicaManager test to handle transaction verification appends separately. (I may revise this)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

of the change*\r\nChanged StandaloneHerder to always synchronize on itself before invoking any methods on MemoryConfigBackingStore. This helped the situation as the order of acquiring locks is always the same. First on the herder and then on the config backing store.\r\n\r\n*Testing strategy*\r\nManually tested StandaloneHerder from Kafka 2.6.3 and Kafka 3.6.1 and both have the same issue. 9 times out of 10 startup ends in deadlock. Tested after fixing (3.8.0-SNAPSHOT) and the deadlock is not happening anymore.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

It's because we create a reaper thread in test, which is not expected. We should create a mocked one like other purgatory instance.\r\n2. Throttle threads. We created a `quotaManager` to feed into the replicaManager, but didn't close it. Actually, we have created a global `quotaManager` instance and will close it on `AfterEach`. We should re-use it.\r\n3. replicaManager and logManager didn't invoke `close` after test.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n-

@stanislavkozlovski found [here](https://gist.github.com/stanislavkozlovski/8959f7ee59434f774841f4ae2f5228c2), there are some tests ran more than 1 ~ 2 hours, which make our CI build meet 8 hours timeout. We should set a timeout for each test as 10 mins using a junit5 feature [here](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-declarative-timeouts-default-timeouts). If it exceeds 10m, it doesn't make sense to keep waiting and we should fail them, and investigate/improve them. This way, we can resolve the CI timeout issue.\r\n\r\nIf it exceeds the timeout, it'll fail with the exception:\r\n```\r\nGradle Test Run :storage:test > Gradle Test Executor 21 > TransactionsWithTieredStoreTest > testDelayedFetchIncludesAbortedTransaction(String) > testDelayedFetchIncludesAbortedTransaction(String).quorum=zk FAILED\r\n    java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException: testDelayedFetchIncludesAbortedTransaction(java.lang.String) timed out after 10 seconds\r\n        at org.junit.jupiter.engine.extension.TimeoutExceptionFactory.create(TimeoutExceptionFactory.java:29)\r\n        at org.junit.jupiter.engine.extension.SameThreadTimeoutInvocation.proceed(SameThreadTimeoutInvocation.java:58)\r\n        at org.junit.jupiter.engine.extension.TimeoutExtension.intercept(TimeoutExtension.java:156)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the stream tests are still using junit4, we can only set timeout for each test suite. I added timeout for `KTableKTableLeftJoinTest` separately as highlighted [here](https://gist.github.com/stanislavkozlovski/8959f7ee59434f774841f4ae2f5228c2).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

This caused serialization errors when trying to read from the store because the deserializers did not expect the timestamp to be prepended.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we allow creating non-timestamped stores using the `DslWindowParams`\r\n\r\nTesting was done both manually as well as adding a unit test to ensure that the stores created are not timestamped. I also confirmed that the only place in the code `persistentWindowStore` was used before #14648 was in the `StreamJoined` code.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

from remote log segment implementation does not handled log compaction cases. It always assumes record batch will exist in the required segment for the requested offset. But there is a possibility where the requested offset is the last offset of the segment and has been removed due to log compaction. Then it requires to iterate over the next higher segment for further data as it has been done for local segment[ fetch request. ](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/317f61dfd9a7f1443cf75b6a32568d1c81984d08/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/LocalLog.scala#L425)\r\n**Fixes**\r\n1.

investigating build instabilities, I saw a build failing with the following message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe Daemon will expire after the build after running out of JVM heap space.\r\nThe project memory settings are likely not configured or are configured to an insufficient value.\r\nThe daemon will restart for the next build, which may increase subsequent build times.\r\nThese settings can be adjusted by setting 'org.gradle.jvmargs' in 'gradle.properties'.\r\nThe currently configured max heap space is '1.3 GiB' and the configured max metaspace is 'unknown'.\r\nFor more information on how to set these values, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.5/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:configuring_jvm_memory in the Gradle documentation.\r\nTo disable this warning, set 'org.gradle.daemon.performance.disable-logging=true'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis made me think about how we use daemons with gradle because we use `org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2g -Xss4m -XX:+UseParallelGC` in `gradle.properties`. So why is the max heap reported as `1.3 GiB`? Could it be that we reuse gradle workers spawned by other projects? I also wonder that happen when previous tests leak resources. Do they stay for ever until the worker dies?\r\n\r\nSo, I would like to try using `--no-daemon` to see whether it improves our builds.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

tests are removed in this [commit](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/15015/commits/517a7c19d5a19bc94f0f79c02a239fd1ff7f6991) because they are flaky. \r\n\r\nAfter investigation, the causes are:\r\n1. `remoteLogSizeComputationTime`: It failed with `Expected to find 1000 for RemoteLogSizeComputationTime metric value, but found 0`. The reason is because if the verification thread is too slow, and the 2nd run of RLMTask started, then it'll reset the value back to 0. Fix it by adding latch to wait for verification.\r\n2. `remoteFetchExpiresPerSec`: It failed with `The ExpiresPerSec value is not incremented. Current value is: 0`. The reason is because the `remoteFetchExpiresPerSec` metric is a static metric. And we remove all metrics after each test completed in `tearDown` method. So once `remoteFetchExpiresPerSec` is removed, it won't be created again like other metrics. And that's why it failed sometimes in Jenkins because if there is a previous test have expired remote fetch, then this metric will be created and removed forever. Fix it by only removing it in `afterAll`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

Streams checkpoints the wrong offset when a task is closed during restoration. If under exactly-once processing guarantees a TaskCorruptedException happens, the affected task is closed dirty, its state content is wiped out and the task is re-initialized. If during the following restoration the task is closed cleanly, the task writes the offsets that it stores in its record collector to the checkpoint file. Those offsets are the offsets that the task wrote to the changelog topics. In other words, the task writes the end offsets of its changelog topics to the checkpoint file. Consequently, when the task is initialized again on the same Streams client, the checkpoint file is read and the task assumes it is fully restored although the records between the last offsets the task restored before closing clean and the end offset of the changelog topics are missing locally.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to clear the offsets in the record collector on close.\r\n\r\n### Committer
