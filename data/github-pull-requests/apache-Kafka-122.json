PR works to improve high watermark checkpointing performance.\r\n\r\n`ReplicaManager.checkpointHighWatermarks()` was found to be a major contributor to GC pressure, especially on Kafka clusters with high partition counts and low throughput.\r\n\r\n#### Commit gardnervickers@4307a73 \r\nAdds a JMH benchmark for `checkpointHighWatermarks` which establishes a baseline for the commits which come after it. \r\n\r\nThe parameterized benchmark was run with 100, 1000 and 2000 topics. \r\n\r\n#### Commit 27c1ba1\r\nModifies `ReplicaManager.checkpointHighWatermarks()` to avoid extra copies, and caches the Log parent directory to avoid frequent allocations when calculating the `File.getParent()`. It appears `Log.dir` is accessed from `ReplicaManager.checkpointHighWatermarks` without taking the `Log.lock` currently, this PR does the same for the cached `Log.parentDir`. I considered making these values change atomically but I had some trouble thinking of a case where not taking the lock would be safe with the current implementation, but unsafe with these proposed changes.  \r\n\r\n#### Improvements over gardnervickers@4307a73  (baseline)\r\n\r\n| Topic Count | Ops/ms | MB/sec allocated |\r\n|-------------|---------|------------------|\r\n| 100               |

implementation. After this patch, consumers will continue to fetch only from the leader, since the broker implementation to select an alternate read replica is not included here.\r\n\r\nAdds new `client.rack` consumer configuration property is added which allows the consumer to indicate its rack. This is just an arbitrary string to indicate some relative location, it doesn't have to actually represent a physical rack. We are keeping the naming consistent with the broker property (`broker.rack`).\r\n\r\nFetchRequest now includes `rack_id` which can optionally be specified by the consumer. FetchResponse includes an optional `preferred_read_replica` field for each partition in the response. OffsetForLeaderEpochRequest also adds new `replica_id` field which is similar to the same field in FetchRequest.\r\n\r\nWhen the consumer sees a `preferred_read_replica` in a fetch response, it will use the Node with that ID for the next

changes to support creating topics using the cluster defaults for replication and partitions:\r\n\r\n1. Adds a `NewTopic(String)` constructor to the `NewTopic` API\r\n2. Changes the `AdminManager` to accept `-1` as valid options for replication factor and partitions. If this is the case, it will resolve it using the default configuration.\r\n3. This also adds a dependency on scalaJava8Compat library to make it simpler to convert Scala `Option` to `Optional`.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- Updated unit tests with the new conditions\r\n\r\n###

relied on `KafkaConsumer#poll` to send a `MetadataRequest` within 100ms to verify if a topic is auto created or not. This is brittle and does not guarantee if the request made it to the broker or was processed successfully. This PR fixes the flaky test by adding another topic; we wait until we consume a previously produced record to this topic. This ensures MetadataRequest was processed and we could then check if the topic we're interested in was created or not.","created_at":"2019-05-14T01:52:25Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T03:17:49Z","closed_at":"2019-05-14T22:14:50Z","merged_at":"2019-05-14T22:14:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"16d4d8cafc7394a35caf3354b449505bde56920f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6727/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6727/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6727/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/10b8ce2fe453c382a9508182571eb2fe66eeaa3b","head":{"label":"dhruvilshah3:flaky-test","ref":"flaky-test","sha":"10b8ce2fe453c382a9508182571eb2fe66eeaa3b","user":{"login":"dhruvilshah3","id":14958864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTU4ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14958864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruvilshah3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121815241,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjE4MTUyNDE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"dhruvilshah3/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dhruvilshah3","id":14958864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTU4ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14958864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruvilshah3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dhruvilshah3/kafka","description":"Mirror

regex used to parse config provider syntax can fail to accurately parse provided configurations when multiple path-less configs are requested (e.g., `${provider:pathOne} ${provider:pathTwo}`). This change fixes that parsing and adds a unit test to prevent regression.\r\n\r\nThis bug is present since the addition of config providers and so should be backported through to 2.0, when they were

Find the consumer group coordinator\r\n2. Send the request to the node found in step 1\r\n\r\nBut the coordinator can get moved between step 1 and 2. In that case we\r\ncurrently fail. This change fixes that by detecting this error and then\r\nretrying.\r\n\r\nFollowing APIs are impacted by this behavior:\r\n1. listConsumerGroupOffsets\r\n2. deleteConsumerGroups\r\n3. describeConsumerGroups\r\n\r\nEach of these call result in AdminClient making multiple calls to the backend.\r\nAs AdminClient code invokes each backend api in a separate event loop, the code\r\nthat detects the error (step 2) need to restart whole operation including\r\nstep 1. This needed a change to capture the \"Call\" object for step 1 in\r\nstep 2.\r\n\r\nThis change thus refactors the code to make it easy to perform a retry of\r\nwhole operation. It creates a Context object to capture the api arguments\r\nthat can then be referred by each \"Call\" objects. This is just for convenience\r\nand makes method signature simpler as we only need to pass one object instead\r\nof multiple api arguments.\r\n\r\nThe creation of each \"Call\" object is done in a new method, so we can\r\neasily resubmit step 1 in step 2.\r\n\r\nThis change also modifies corresponding unit test to test this scenario.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

log cleaner attempts to preserve the last entry for each producerId in order to ensure that sequence/epoch state is not lost. The current validation checks only the last sequence number for each producerId in order to decide whether a batch should be retained. There are two problems with this:\r\n\r\n1. Sequence numbers are not unique alone. It is the tuple of sequence number and epoch which is uniquely defined.\r\n2. The group coordinator always writes batches beginning with sequence number 0, which means there could be many batches which have the same sequence number.\r\n\r\nThe complete fix for the second issue is probably to do the proper sequence number bookkeeping in the coordinator. For now, I have left the coordinator implementation unchanged and changed the cleaner logic to use the last offset written by a producer instead of the last sequence number. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer

The implementation is selected by the `replica.selector.class` broker config. Only the leader can calculate the preferred replica, and it only does so for regular consumer fetch requests. Three implementations are included here, but for the first phase we will probably only include the leader-only selector.\r\n\r\nA new `client.rack` consumer configuration property is added which allows the consumer to indicate its rack.\r\n\r\nFetchRequest now includes \"rack_id\" field which can optionally be specified by the consumer. FetchResponse includes an optional \"preferred_read_replica\" field for each partition in the response.\r\n\r\nReplicaManager was also modified to allow fetch requests from regular consumers to non-leader replicas if (and only if) the consumer includes \"rack_id\" field in the fetch request.","created_at":"2019-05-10T13:48:26Z","updated_at":"2019-05-15T17:37:58Z","closed_at":"2019-05-14T19:41:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"52c110705c70d75c7ab7ebbe3bd8a1d4f34065cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6711/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6711/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6711/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/5669ed4555e9e84f815488825506d9366d889bf3","head":{"label":"mumrah:kip-392","ref":"kip-392","sha":"5669ed4555e9e84f815488825506d9366d889bf3","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

KAFKA-7817 ConsumerGroupCommand Regex Feature\r\n\r\n**Description**: \r\nAdd ability to select a subset of consumer groups using regex for operations: --describe, --delete and --reset-offsets\r\n**Motivation**:\r\nSuppose we have a subset of consumer groups with similar prefixes: group1, group2, ..., groupN and we want to apply operations (--describe/--delete/--reset) over [group1, group2, ..., group7] using CLI. \r\nIt would be easier to declare a regex instead of listing all groups by name:\r\n```bash\r\nbin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server :9092 --describe      --regex group[1-7]\r\nbin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server :9092 --delete        --regex group[1-7]\r\nbin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server :9092 --reset-offsets --regex group[1-7] \\\r\n                             --topic topic --to-offset 50\r\n```\r\n\r\n**JIRA**: [Multiple Consumer Group Management with Regex](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7817)\r\n**Discussion 1**: [Re: Multiple Consumer Group Management](https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@kafka.apache.org/msg93781.html)\r\n**Discussion 2**: [Re: ConsumerGroupCommand tool improvement?](https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@kafka.apache.org/msg90561.html)\r\n**Tests:**: *Unit tests implemented*\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

Adding a class **SimplifiedDefaultRecord** implement class Record which define  various attributes of a message. \r\n2. Adding Function **simplifiedreadFrom**() at class **DefaultRecord** .This function will not read data from DataInput to  ByteBuffer which need newly creating .**This will reduce the allocation and copying of ByteBuffer** when logValidator do validation .This will reduces GC frequency. We offer a simple read function to read data from **DataInput** whithout create ByteBuffer.Of course this opertion can not avoid deconmpression to data.\r\n3. Adding Function **simplifiedIterator**() and **simplifiedCompressedIterator**() at class **DefaultRecordBatch**.This two functions will return iterator of instance belongs to class **SimplifiedDefaultRecord**.\r\n4. Modify code of function **validateMessagesAndAssignOffsetsCompressed**() at class  LogValidator.\r\n\r\n    **After modifing code wich  reducing the allocation and copying of ByteBuffer**, the test performance is greatly improved, and the CPU's stable usage is below 60%. The following is a comparison of different code test performance under the same conditions.\r\n**Result of performance testing**\r\nMain config of Kafka: Single

issue for this PR could be found here:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7994?jql=project%20%3D%20KAFKA%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened%2C%20%22Patch%20Available%22)\r\n\r\nAs noted in the JIRA description, stream time is incorrectly set to -1 after rebalances and restarts. To help resolve this issue, one approach is to commit the individual partition time with last message processed for each RecordQueue. Hence, after a restart, we could set the partition time to the last committed partition time. \r\n\r\nWe would also have to forward timestamps down stream after the head of the DAG receives records that updates stream time and global time. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

expanding the kafka cluster, the new follower will read the data from the earliest offset. This can result in a large amount of historical data being read from the disk, putting a lot of pressure on the disk and affecting the performance of the kafka service, for example, the producer write latency will increase. In general, kafka's original expansion mechanism has the following problems:\r\n          1. The new follower will put a lot of pressure on the disk;\r\n          2. Causes the producer write latency to increase;\r\n          3. Causes the consumer read latency to increase;\r\n       In order to solve these problems, we have proposed a solution for smooth expansion. The main idea of ​​the scheme is that the newly added follower reads data from the HW position, and when the newly added follower reads the data to a certain time threshold or data size threshold, the follower enters the ISR queue. . Since the new follower reads data from the HW location, most of the data read is in the operating system's cache, so it does not put pressure on the disk and does not affect the performance of the kafka service, thus solving the above problems.","created_at":"2019-05-07T06:52:28Z","updated_at":"2024-12-22T03:39:39Z","closed_at":"2024-12-22T03:39:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"151ff301b116e9a3a55f7188ace0c735db3d0f67","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

PR works to improve high watermark checkpointing performance. \r\n\r\n`ReplicaManager.checkpointHighWatermarks()` was found to be a major contributor to GC pressure, especially on Kafka clusters with high partition counts.\r\n\r\n#### Commit gardnervickers@4307a73 \r\nAdds a JMH benchmark for `checkpointHighWatermarks` which establishes a baseline for the commits which come after it. \r\n\r\nThe parameterized benchmark was run with 100, 1000 and 2000 topics. \r\n\r\n#### Commit gardnervickers@ceb8272 \r\nModifies `ReplicaManager.checkpointHighWatermarks()` to avoid extra copies, and caches the Log parent directory to avoid frequent allocations when calculating the `File.getParent()`. It appears `Log.dir` is accessed from `ReplicaManager.checkpointHighWatermarks` without taking the `Log.lock` currently, this PR does the same for the cached `Log.parentDir`. I considered making these values change atomically but I had some trouble thinking of a case where not taking the lock would be safe with the current implementation, but unsafe with these proposed changes.  \r\n\r\nThe following improvements were measured off baseline\r\n- 100 topics\r\n  - +29% ops/ms\r\n  - -63% MB/sec alloc\r\n- 1000 topics\r\n  - +86% ops/ms\r\n  - -35% MB/sec alloc\r\n- 2000 topics\r\n  - +72% ops/ms\r\n  - -55% MB/sec alloc\r\n\r\n#### Commit gardnervickers@c1830fe\r\nThis is a pretty invasive/significant refactor of the `CheckpointFile` code and accompanying classes. The goal was to avoid unnecessary buffering and allocation when constructing and writing out the checkpoint file. Also, I attempted to encourage inlining as much as possible. The change set is pretty drastic but the improvements are attractive. \r\n\r\nThe following improvements were measured off baseline\r\n- 100 topics\r\n  - +45% ops/ms\r\n  - -679% MB/sec alloc\r\n- 1000 topics\r\n  - +222% ops/ms\r\n  - -256% MB/sec alloc\r\n- 2000 topics\r\n  - +186% ops/ms\r\n  - -339% MB/sec alloc\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it would be reasonable if the project only wanted to take gardnervickers@ceb8272 (or a variant of it) for now, if the changes in gardnervickers@c1830fe seem too extreme. \r\n\r\n#### JMH

the unit tests by having {RocksDB/InMemory}{Window/Session}StoreTest extend {Window/Session}BytesStoreTest. Besides some implementation-specific tests (eg involving segment maintenance) all tests were moved to the abstract XXXBytesStoreTest class. The test coverage now is a superset of the original test coverage for each store type. \r\n\r\nThe only difference made to existing tests (besides moving them) was to switch from list-based equality comparison to set based, in order to reflect that the stores make no guarantees regarding the ordering of records returned from a range fetch.\r\n\r\nThere are some implementation-specific tests that were left in the corresponding test class. The RocksDBWindowStoreTest, for example, had several tests pertaining to segments and/or the underlying filesystem. Another key difference is that the in-memory versions should delete expired records aggressively, while the RocksDB versions should only remove entirely expired

split the part of SslFactory that creates SSLEngine instances into SslEngineBuilder.  When (re)configuring, we simply create a new SslEngineBuilder.  This allows us to make all the builder fields immutable.  It also simplifies the logic for reconfiguring.  Because we   sometimes need to test old SslEngine instances against new ones, being able to use both the old and the new builder at once is useful.\r\n\r\nCreate an enum named SslClientAuth which encodes the possible values for ssl.client.auth.  This will simplify the handling of this configuration.\r\n\r\nSslTransportLayer#maybeProcessHandshakeFailure should treat an SSLHandshakeException with a \"Received fatal alert\" message as a handshake error (and therefore an authentication error.)\r\n\r\nSslFactoryTest: add some line breaks for very long lines.\r\n\r\nConfigCommand#main: when terminating the command due to an uncaught exception, log the exception using debug level in slf4j, in addition to printing it to stderr.  This makes it easier to debug failing junit tests, where stderr may not be kept, or may be reordered with respect to  other slf4j messages.  The use of debug level is consistent with how we handle other types of exceptions in ConfigCommand#main.\r\n\r\nStateChangeLogMerger#main: spell out the full name of scala.io.Source rather than abbreviating it as io.Source.  This makes it clearer that it is part of the Scala standard library.  It also avoids compiler errors when other libraries whose groupId starts with \"io\" are used in the broker.","created_at":"2019-05-03T22:03:19Z","updated_at":"2019-05-20T18:51:34Z","closed_at":"2019-05-15T20:53:00Z","merged_at":"2019-05-15T20:53:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"0494cd329f3aaed94b3b46de0abe495f80faaedd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6674/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6674/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6674/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/52ee1cfeb470cc2ee8f4bb317016dbc2d8dd7c09","head":{"label":"cmccabe:refactor-ssl","ref":"refactor-ssl","sha":"52ee1cfeb470cc2ee8f4bb317016dbc2d8dd7c09","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

a REST extension can cause deadlock if it requests the list of connectors from its `ConnectRestExtensionContext.clusterState()` in its `ConnectRestExtension.register(...)` method. This is because the `ConnectClusterState` implementation is backed by a `HerderProvider` that, at that time, has no associated `Herder` instance, and since that `Herder` is given to the `HerderProvider` later by the same thread, deadlock occurs until the call to `HerderProvider.get()` made by the `ConnectClusterStateImpl` times out. At this point, startup fails and the Connect worker dies.\r\n\r\nThe changes here separate `RestServer.start(...)` into two separate methods. The first, `RestServer.initializeServer()`, starts the Jetty server and binds to a port, which ensure the accuracy of the `RestServer.advertisedUrl()` method that is used later on by both the `ConnectStandalone` and `ConnectDistributed` classes to determine the worker ID. The second, `RestServer.initializeResources(Herder herder)` actually creates the Connect REST resources (`RootResource`, `ConnectorsResource`, etc.) and registers all REST extensions.\r\n\r\nSince these changes make `HerderProvider` obsolete and it is not part of any public API, that interface is also removed.\r\n\r\nThis approach ensures that the Connect REST interface is started only when all of its REST extensions have been successfully registered, which is important for security use cases where request filters are installed and parts of the Connect REST API are subject to authentication/authorization.\r\n\r\nBetween the call to `RestServer.intializeServer()` and `RestServer.initializeResources(...)`, any requests made to the worker will result in a 404 response. This is slightly less desirable than the current behavior, which is to block on requests until the herder is up and running, but shouldn't be too much of an issue.\r\n\r\nA new integration test is added that verifies that a call to `ConnectRestExtensionContext.clusterState().connectors()` succeeds. This test fails on the current `trunk` branch, and succeeds with the changes involved in this PR.\r\n\r\nThese changes should be backported through to 2.0.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

The format looks like `group.instance.id-timestamp`.\r\n\r\nDuring consumer/broker interaction logic (Join, Sync, Heartbeat, Commit), we shall check the whether `group.instance.id` is known on group. If yes, we shall match the `member.id` stored on static membership map with the request `member.id`. If mismatching, this indicates a conflict consumer has used same group.instance.id, and it will receive a fatal exception to shut down.\r\n\r\nRight now the only missing part is the system test.

changes here add four new methods to the `AbstractConfig` class that mirror the existing `getConfiguredInstance(...)` and `getConfiguredInstances(...)` methods; the only difference is that any parameter of type `Class<T>` is changed to `TypeLiteral<T>` and that type checking is done with `TypeUtils.isInstance(...)` instead of `Class.isInstance(...)`\r\n\r\nA new unit test (`AbstractConfigTest.testGenericClassInstantiation()`) confirms this behavior, including the lack of unchecked cast warnings and the throwing of a runtime exception when an attempt is made to instantiate a class that extends from/implements the proper raw type but with improper type parameters.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and
