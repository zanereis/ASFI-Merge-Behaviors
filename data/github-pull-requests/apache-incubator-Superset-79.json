The command reads the profile and manifest files, creating/updating databases and datasets in Superset based on them.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nGiven this `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nsuperset_examples:\r\n  outputs:\r\n\r\n    dev:\r\n      type: postgres\r\n      threads: 1\r\n      host: localhost\r\n      port: 5432\r\n      user: beto\r\n      pass: ''\r\n      dbname: examples_dev\r\n      schema: public\r\n      meta:\r\n        superset:\r\n          cache_timeout: 300  # arbitrary metadata for our DB\r\n\r\n  target: dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe file `messages_channels.sql`:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n  messages.ts,\r\n  channels.name,\r\n  messages.text\r\nFROM\r\n  {{ source ('public', 'messages') }} messages\r\n  JOIN {{ source ('public', 'channels') }} channels ON messages.channel_id = channels.id\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd `schema.yaml`:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nversion: 2\r\n\r\nsources:\r\n  - name: public\r\n    tables:\r\n      - name: messages\r\n        description: 'Messages in the Slack channel'\r\n      - name: channels\r\n        description: 'Information about Slack channels'\r\n\r\nmetrics:\r\n  - name: cnt \r\n    label: ''\r\n    model: ref('messages_channels')\r\n    description: ''\r\n    type: count\r\n    sql: '*'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ superset sync dbt \\\r\n> ~/Projects/dbt-examples/superset_examples/target/manifest.json \\\r\n> --project superset_examples \\\r\n> --target dev  # not needed, default is already \"dev\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will (1) create (or update) the a new database connection based on Postgres:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2022-01-19 at 14-46-25 Superset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/150230699-91f9cd7f-dd21-48bf-b3e6-2130231635c3.png)\r\n\r\nIt will also (2) create/update three datasets owner by the admin:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-01-19 at 2 47 47 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/150230862-cbc08c85-0659-4193-9008-d2096a6e628a.png)\r\n\r\n(Note that the dataset description comes from the DBT config.)\r\n\r\nIt will also populate metrics:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2022-01-19 at 14-48-38 Superset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/150230948-e3189bd8-5db6-48aa-a483-c7ab201a6e0e.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Create a DBT project.\r\n2. Run `superset sync dbt /path/to/project/target/manifest.json --project PROJECT --target TARGET`\r\n\r\nCheck that everything is imported correctly.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this only works for Postgres, but adding other [profile types](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/profiles.yml) is straightforward.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThere's been increasing interest in managing superset assets (databases, datasets, charts, dashboards) externally. An immediate use case that is possible today is creating a directory with YAML files from the new import/export format:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrepo/metadata.yaml\r\nrepo/databases/db.yaml\r\nrepo/datasets/db/dataset.yaml\r\nrepo/charts/chart.yaml\r\nrepo/dashboards/dash.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then periodically syncing the directory to Superset with:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsuperset import-directory /path/to/repo\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though this works, users are still able to modify these assets in the UI, introducing unintended modifications, as well as frustration for the users when those changes are reverted in the next sync.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the import/export scenario, people have been syncing model (and metric!) definitions [from DBT to Superset](https://github.com/slidoapp/dbt-superset-lineage/) (as well as from Superset to DBT). Users have also shown interest in syncing from [Supergrain](https://www.supergrain.com/) and [Transform](https://transform.co/).\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces 2 new columns to databases, datasets, charts and dashboards:\r\n\r\n1. `is_managed_externally`: a boolean defaulting to \"false\".\r\n2. `external_url`: a nullable string representing an URL pointing to more information about the resource.\r\n\r\nThere are no UI changes in this PR, but I'm planning following PRs that modify the CRUD dialogs (and the backend) to prevent editing the resources when `is_managed_externally` is true. In the future we could also add an affordance using `external_url`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR addresses issue #17550 regarding histogram percentile displaying the formula instead of the value. The long formula also causes the entire tooltip box to be long, which possibly leads to the entire tooltip being hidden to the side of the plot.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-01-19 09-26-36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19884163/150052803-d3f29477-4325-42e0-98ea-4e8a24f34044.png)\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-01-19 09-34-39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19884163/150052932-e95bd5d2-b371-41e0-bc6b-69c4373b636d.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Open any histogram chart, \"FCC 2018 Survey's Age distribution of respondents\" is an included example.\r\n- Hover the mouse pointer

What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. First and foremost, create a virtual dataset in SQLlab and open it in explore.\r\n```\r\nSELECT \r\n'foo' as supersupersupersupersuper_long_column,\r\n'foo' as short_column\r\n```\r\n2. (default) verify that \r\na) There is a tooltip on the `supersupersupersupersuper_long_column`\r\nb) There isn't a tooltip on the `short_column`\r\nc) There isn't a tooltip on the `count`\r\nd) there aren't tooltips when you scale datasouce-panel up.\r\n\r\n3. verify verbose name name\r\na) tooltip will **always** appear column(metric) name **and** verbose name if you set verbose name in columns or metrics(except verbose truncated)\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\nMultiple small improvements to the generator:\r\n- add a default lock file to avoid having to `npm i --force`\r\n- tie the `<h3>` bottom and top margins to the main theme\r\n- add missing `px` suffix to size styles (`height`, `width`, `font-size`)\r\n- set vertical size of hello world `<pre>` element to make the title sticky\r\n- Make the plugin name configurable and change the default from `Superset Plugin Chart Hello World` to `Hello World`\r\n- Make the regular chart (non-timeseries) the new default chart type\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOT\r\nNow the title size is adjustable, the `<h3>` margins are sensible and the `<pre>` tag is scrollable and doesn't spill over.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/149907904-9e9ff426-7709-4e18-bb3b-569086991ff9.png)\r\n\r\nThe default name is now \"Hello World\" (excl. the \"Superset Chart

SUMMARY\r\n\r\n### Short description:\r\n\r\nFixes an issue with rison caused by differences of encoding/decoding between front end and back end dependencies.\r\n\r\nAlso, fixes some issues caused by sending and/or retrieving URLs without cleaning/encoding potential URL breaking syntax added by the user.\r\n\r\nInvolves these issues #17288 and #13708\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Detailed Description:\r\n\r\nThis mostly comes down to three problems:\r\n1. The JavaScript rison encodes/decodes in a slightly different way than the Python rison does\r\n2. rison's encode method doesn't URL encode by default so URL queries can be broken by the user's input\r\n3. When we retrieve a query string appended to a route (Refresh the page during a search), it gets read as a URL. So certain characters can break the URL and cause rison to try to read incomplete or improperly encoded/decoded strings.\r\n\r\n### 1. Rison encode/decode:\r\nThis might seem complicated at first but it really comes down to a difference in a single Regular Expression (regex).\r\n\r\nTo put it very simply, rison is a way to make a string from an object. It aims to make this string as compact, human-readable, and URL-friendly as possible. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/Nanonid/rison).\r\n\r\nIt will take this:\r\n```javascript\r\n{ filters: [{ value: 'string' }, { value: 100 }] }\r\n```\r\nand turn it into this:\r\n```javascript\r\n(filters:!((value:string),(value:100)))\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Both the JS rison and Python rison **can** encode any object thrown at it\r\n- Both the JS rison and Python rison **can** decode any string that _they_ encoded\r\n- Both the JS rison and Python rison **can't** decode all strings that the _other_ has encoded\r\n\r\nSo what is happening?\r\n\r\nThe answer comes down to the regex that I mentioned. \r\n\r\nBoth of them have a function that builds a string of characters to be used in the regex that decides whether a character can be a valid \"id\". An id is any value being used as a rison value. (filters, value, 'string', and 100 are all ids in the previous examples)\r\n\r\nRison has reserved values that can't be used as ids but a \"string\" value that is passed can have _any_ characters inside of it as long as it has 'single quotes' around it. Rison encode will provide these 'single quotes' around any value that contains a character that it has reserved or restricted for its syntax.  This helps rison know a value is a string and thus parse the reserved characters correctly.\r\n\r\nThe regex expression is what decides this and will fail to decode the string if it determines that single quotes weren't added correctly because it sees it as invalid syntax.\r\n\r\nSo why is the regex different?\r\n\r\nI don't know the motivation behind this but as I mentioned, there is a loop that builds the string in the JS rison and the Python rison. Both of these loops build the same string.\r\n\r\nBut for some reason, the JS rison overwrites this string with a different hard typed one immediately after it is made.\r\n\r\nJS:\r\n```javascript\r\n(function () {\r\n    var l = [];\r\n    for (var hi = 0; hi < 16; hi++) {\r\n        for (var lo = 0; lo < 16; lo++) {\r\n            if (hi+lo === 0) continue;\r\n            var c = String.fromCharCode(hi*16 + lo);\r\n            if (! /\\w|[-_.\\/~]/.test(c))\r\n                l.push('\\\\u00' + hi.toString(16) + lo.toString(16));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    rison.not_idchar = l.join('');  // <<--- Where it is added\r\n})();\r\n//rison.not_idchar  = \" \\t\\r\\n\\\"<>[]{}'!=:(),*@$;&\";\r\nrison.not_idchar  = \" '!:(),*@$\"; // <<--- Where it is reassigned\r\n```\r\n\r\nPython:\r\n```python\r\nNOT_IDCHAR = ''.join([c for c in (chr(i) for i in range(127))\r\n                      if not (c.isalnum()\r\n                              or c in IDCHAR_PUNCTUATION)])\r\n\r\n# ^^^ Good ol python code not doing anything weird ^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo all we need to do is change that id_char variable on the javascript rison and update it's regex. Then we have the javascript rison encoding the same way that the python rison is expecting it to be. \r\n\r\nThis fixes the issues that cause a 400 error when searching for these symbols by themselves \r\n```\r\n& # ? ^ { } [ ] | \" = + `\r\n```\r\n\r\n### My implementation\r\n\r\nI will admit that I do not believe this is the best possible implementation. I just wanted to provide a solution and get feedback to hopefully find a better way. This is a pretty unique problem and there are a ton of different directions we could go with the fix.\r\n\r\nWhat I have in this PR is a fix that will take the rison global object that gets created and mutates the regex properties on it to make it work with the backend decoding.\r\n\r\nI just took the code from rison where it is creating the regex and then overwrote the properties that use it.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Modifies the rison encoding slightly to match the backend's\r\n// rison encoding/decoding. Applies globally. Code pulled from rison.js\r\n(() => {\r\n  const risonRef: {\r\n    not_idchar: string;\r\n    not_idstart: string;\r\n    id_ok: RegExp;\r\n    next_id: RegExp;\r\n  } = rison as any;\r\n\r\n  const l = [];\r\n  for (let hi = 0; hi < 16; hi += 1) {\r\n    for (let lo = 0; lo < 16; lo += 1) {\r\n      if (hi + lo === 0) continue;\r\n      const c = String.fromCharCode(hi * 16 + lo);\r\n      if (!/\\w|[-_./~]/.test(c))\r\n        l.push(`\\\\u00${hi.toString(16)}${lo.toString(16)}`);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  risonRef.not_idchar = l.join('');\r\n  risonRef.not_idstart = '-0123456789';\r\n\r\n  const idrx = `[^${risonRef.not_idstart}${risonRef.not_idchar}][^${risonRef.not_idchar}]*`;\r\n\r\n  risonRef.id_ok = new RegExp(`^${idrx}$`);\r\n  risonRef.next_id = new RegExp(idrx, 'g');\r\n})();\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy problem with my solution is that it is feels hacky and it doesn't feel like there is a good place for this code to live. I put it in `CRUD/utils.tsx` because it seemed like the right choice.\r\n\r\nThere is also the issue of this code being immediately executed out in the open and not being clearly contained anywhere.\r\n\r\nAlternative options:\r\n- Somehow intercept and modify rison before it ever gets imported into react ( I couldn't figure this out )\r\n- Fork the rison repo and modify that one line to get this to work as expected ( who will maintain the fork and the node module? )\r\n- Have a local Superset specific rison package live inside the project and change that one line of code ( feels like overkill for a single line of difference )\r\n- Use Json instead of rison for these calls ( not sure how this would look but Flask App Builder rison decorator has a fall back to json so this is an option )\r\n- Parse the encoded rison strings and modify them to work correctly. ( This will have to be done on all calls containing user input. Also if a new call containing user input is added we will need to do this to it, in other words it's repetitive )\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. Rison encode being URL friendly\r\n\r\nRison encode is URL friendly but it is not perfect when it comes to URLs and rison knows this. So it provided a way to safely send URLs in the form of an alternate encode method called `encode_uri`. Using this is not always necessary but it is useful when you are unsure about the data that is being provided in your string like when user input is involved. [Here](https://github.com/Nanonid/rison#interaction-with-uri--encoding) is where it is talked about in the README.\r\n\r\nSo I switched to encode_uri for the API calls that are building strings that may have user input.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the Fatal Errors that are returned from the backend when a search string includes & or # or includes a percent encoded value like a single quote (%27). This also prevents the user from being able to search using percent encoded values. For example, if you currently search %27%26%27 ('&') in any of the list-views it will actually return the results that include an ampersand.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3. URL encoding for QueryParams\r\nAnother simple explanation here. The list views use QueryParams to put the query string in the browser URL for search/filter persistence. This is done so you can do things like refresh the page or press the forward and back button without it completely removing the filters, sort orders, etc that you set. At least that's what I believe it is being used for.\r\n\r\nLooks like this:\r\n```\r\nchart/list/?filters=(slice_name:hello)&pageIndex=0&sortColumn=changed_on_delta_humanized&sortOrder=desc&viewMode=card\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis part of it is rison:\r\n```\r\n(slice_name:hello)\r\n```\r\n\r\nQueryParams allows you to set custom encoding/decoding for certain Params but it will still always read from the params as a URL before it decodes. So this means that non percent encoded symbols that can break URLs ( &, #, and unexpected percent encoded strings) will cause issues. \r\n\r\nThis is what is causing the current page breaking Fatal Error that happens on the list views when searching for an & by itself.\r\n\r\nThis is the same fatal error that was happening on the backend but this time it is on the front end.\r\n\r\nI opted to not use the rison.encode_uri method for this because it doesn't keep the string that clean and will percent encode a little too much if certain characters are passed to it. I felt that since the user can see this query in their browser that the best approach would be to keep the percent encoding minimal. \r\n\r\nSo the fix here is to encode only the characters that cause problems by using some String.replace() methods after using rison.encode()\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n          rison.encode(data)\r\n          .replace(/%/g, '%25')\r\n          .replace(/&/g, '%26')\r\n          .replace(/\\+/g, '%2B')\r\n          .replace(/#/g, '%23'),\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n### BEFORE\r\n\r\n**Searching for &**\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-01-31 at 12 09 59 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/151856985-d986c7d3-3aa1-4469-bd03-859431b49987.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Searching for !\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=?>@\\\\[\\]^_`{|}~**\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-01-31 at 12 12 41 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/151857338-c1307a10-2a7f-4a37-b765-43493e43ed24.png)\r\n\r\n**Searching for #**\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-01-31 at 12 56 21 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/151863464-1580630a-7e80-46ae-88d4-318595fa405e.png)\r\n\r\n**Searching for ?**\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-01-31 at 12 58 09 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/151863733-2da495b1-b22a-46b2-9374-df9f4e723b0c.png)\r\n\r\n**Time range for & - 500 response**\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-02-04 at 12 44 24 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/152594250-1df8cc0a-ee0e-4a96-ae72-70482bb770b6.png)\r\n\r\n**Time range for # - 500 response**\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-02-04 at 12 45 19 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/152594279-ea545e8e-c52f-4e55-9f56-98eff602b188.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n\r\n**Searching for &**\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-01-31 at 11 55 28 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/151856558-ce4a1118-8255-44e3-b73d-93c2a89ea53d.png)\r\n\r\n**Searching for !\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=?>@\\\\[\\]^_`{|}~**\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-01-31 at 11 56 11 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/151856610-6b52cec7-07cc-4d11-bf19-a1c209508162.png)\r\n\r\n**Searching for #**\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-01-31 at 1 03 28 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/151864533-c0c135e5-facd-4357-ac93-204a9cee82d5.png)\r\n\r\n**Searching for ?**\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-01-31 at 1 03 45 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/151864545-770565e4-3e1a-45b2-9e84-56a690a07060.png)\r\n\r\n**Time range for &**\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-02-04 at 12 48 48 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/152594292-258ddfef-93a3-4956-9734-950a261c050a.png)\r\n\r\n**Time range for #**\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-02-04 at 12 49 02 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/152594306-8e656442-62f3-4c8f-b9b6-0cae38ccb464.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSince the scope status of native filter is related to active tab, I found that when the user goes to the dashboard from the dashboard list, the active tab state from `useSelector` would be empty, even though react component has updated the active tab state. Eventually I found that `hydrateDashboard` would reset this state but the expectation was that it would not be reset.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n### before\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597121/149433547-fcd17a72-866a-4110-8904-c442965efb8e.mp4\r\n### after\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/149542029-bd01660a-f17f-4004-b1cf-2a29e1736824.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n1) Modified line 573 in `/superset/superset/cli.py`, as the previous code was not properly assigning a boolean value to sync_columns and sync_metrics.\r\n2) Added lines 324-413 in `superset/tests/integration_tests/cli_tests.py` for 3 new unit tests to make sure the --sync flag is working correctly.\r\n\r\nBy modifying the code in `/superset/superset/cli.py`, the Superset import_datasources cli now correctly functions with the --sync flag.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1) Add an existing yaml file to superset by using the Superset cli:\r\n`superset import-datasources -p ~/datasets/data.yaml`\r\n2) Once the yaml file has been added, try using the command again but with the \"-s\"/\"--sync\" flag (imitating what it would be like if you modified a column name or metric in the YAML file and wanted it to be mirrored in the Superset Dataset):\r\n`superset import-datasources -s \"metrics,columns\" -p ~/datasets/data.yaml`\r\n3) Now that the \"-s\"/\"--sync\" flag works as intended, it deletes metrics and/or columns in the DB that are not specified in the YAML file (when using the \"-s\"/\"--sync\" flag).\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, there isn't a chance to use resample in the advanced analytics if you add `groupby column(s)`. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.resample.html?highlight=resample#pandas.DataFrame.resample) didn't provide resample with MultiIndex(AKA, upsampling) on the latest version. (If you want to get more context for this issue, please go to [here](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/28313))\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the original resample operator to support upsampling operation.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. In order to test this feature so we need to prepare an appropriate dataset. Create a virtual dataset via SQLLab. (PostgreSQL dialect)\r\n```\r\nSELECT \r\n  '2022-01-11'::TIMESTAMP as dttm, 'NY' as city, 'US' as country, 1 as val\r\nUNION ALL\r\n  SELECT '2022-01-11'::TIMESTAMP, 'LA', 'US', 2\r\nUNION ALL\r\n  SELECT '2022-01-11'::TIMESTAMP, 'Chicago', 'US', 3\r\nUNION ALL\r\n  SELECT '2022-01-13'::TIMESTAMP, 'NY', 'US', 4\r\nUNION ALL\r\n  SELECT '2022-01-13'::TIMESTAMP, 'LA', 'US', 5\r\nUNION ALL\r\n  SELECT '2022-01-13'::TIMESTAMP, 'Chicago', 'US', 6\r\n```\r\n2. Select `Time-series Line Chart` on explore page\r\n3. Select the above virtual dataset\r\n4. Select `SUM(val)` in metric control\r\n5. Select `city` in groupby control\r\n6. Open `Advanced Analytics` drawer\r\n7. Select `1 calendar day frequency` in Rule selection(Resample section)\r\n8. Select `zero imputation` in fill method control(Resample section)\r\n9. Click `run query` button\r\n\r\nYou can get a viz that contains `2022-01-12` record.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### Before\r\n<img

SUMMARY\r\nIn Time-Series table viz, user can choose `Time Comparison` type to build a table column, and select a gap between times to compare:\r\n<img width=\"358\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-01-13 at 4 00 58 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/149427851-387fb454-675e-46a2-97e5-db655fa9e2a0.png\">\r\n\r\nBut in some cases, for one or more given time spots, some of the metric values could be null, it will make Time Comparison feature not available. In the current code, chart display unavailable data as `0`, which is not accurate, and users can not distinguish the cases where the actual comparison value is `0`. See a real example screenshot below. Note: we will show a **dot** in sparkline if there is a value in the given time spot.\r\n\r\nThis PR is trying to fix these unavailable time-comparison values. instead of showing number `0`, i will display text `N/A`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n**before:**\r\n<img width=\"786\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-01-13 at 12 24 50 PM\"

Lab has more than 50 columns, we don't do any filtering. This isn't obvious from the UI though, since the filter box is still editable.

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nManually reverting https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17654 since it doesn't revert cleanly. We need to revert this because it broke parsing table names from subselects. Ideally we could fix forward, but this seems pretty tricky, so putting up the revert PR for now\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17654#issuecomment-1009487562:\r\nit looks like this PR broke parsing table names from queries with sub selects. Here's a repro case:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT *\r\n   FROM\r\n     (SELECT 1 as foo, 2 as bar)\r\n   ORDER BY foo ASC, bar\r\n```\r\n\r\nParsedQuery now thinks that `ORDER BY` and `bar` are tables:\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-01-10 at 4 36 36 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7409244/148861079-a086fa6a-5198-4f99-910b-3ce77948d195.png)\r\n\r\nDo you think this is something you could easily fix, or should we consider reverting this PR? I could possibly look into fixing myself, but the sql parse codebase is something i'm a bit nervous about jumping into\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI, unit tests, verify in superset shell that parsing subselects works now\r\n```\r\n>>> from superset.sql_parse import ParsedQuery\r\n>>> sql = \"\"\"SELECT *\r\n   FROM\r\n     (SELECT 1 as foo, 2 as bar)\r\n   ORDER BY foo ASC, bar\"\"\"\r\n>>> ParsedQuery(sql).tables\r\nset()\r\n>>> sql = \"\"\"SELECT *\r\n   FROM\r\n     (SELECT 1 as foo, 2 as bar from tbname)\r\n   ORDER BY foo ASC, bar\"\"\"\r\n>>> ParsedQuery(sql).tables\r\n{Table(table='tbname', schema=None, catalog=None)}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

SUMMARY\r\nThis is my PR for issue Extra features for Range Filters #16582 (sorry, I screwed up my original PR #16591)\r\n\r\nRange filters are fantastic, but there is no simple way to adjust the step size or the scale of the range. Scale is useful for large ranges, eg a log scale, so that you can easily select small and large values\r\n\r\n- Step Size is just an additional Advanced Config dropdown box with several pre-populated choices, as well as a free form option. The tricky part was getting it to properly work in the Native Filter Config modal, since they're expecting all parameters to be checkboxes.\r\n- Scale is a little trickier, but it could possibly be set up as multiple options (eg log, power, etc). Currently I implemented a log scale option, which would make zeros hard. I'm currently ignoring that :)\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nConfig Screen Usage\r\n![config screen use](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70416691/132033938-6d095135-698b-448c-aeb7-2ec359388038.gif)\r\n\r\nLog Scale with 0.01 step size\r\n![log-scale and 0 01 step](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70416691/132033942-06eda7eb-1f09-49c9-a3bf-847de4848a5e.gif)\r\n\r\nLinear Scale with 100k step size\r\n![linear-scale and 100k step](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70416691/132033945-2b592134-3614-4ac4-84eb-d6eb497e9e36.gif)\r\n\r\nConfig Screen Defaults\r\n![config screen defaults](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70416691/132033950-9f026b6b-b364-465a-81c1-c224869b4c65.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17573 fixed the sorting of floating point numbers, but broke sorting strings that start with numbers. The most common of these are dses like `2022-01-01`, and `parseFloat(\"2022-01-01\") === 2022`, so sorting got all janky.\r\n\r\nI've fixed this by ensuring that we only try to parse numbers if they pass a regex that matches JS's format of numbers.\r\n\r\nNote that this solution isn't 100% accurate, and will still cause undefined behavior when sorting a list containing both numeric and non numeric strings. I don't have a good answer for fixing this, but perhaps in the future we'll need to refactor this further. I'd imagine a per column parameter that defines the sorting function (convert to number and then sort, do string sort, sort in hexadecimal because all the strings start with `0x` and contain only `0-f`, something else) but that was very much out of scope of this bug fix.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nNew unit test (and ensure the unit test added in #17573 still works)\r\n\r\n###

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen we run `test_connection` when adding a database, the response might error only after 1-2 minutes, depending on the parameters. The error comes back only when the network connection from the driver times out, and because this requests runs in a separate thread and in a 3rd party library we can't adjust that timeout.\r\n\r\nWe have a `@timeout` context manager [in our code base](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/utils/core.py#L748-L812), but they don't work here because SQLAlchemy runs the `ping` command in a separate thread. To enforce a shorter timeout on `ping` I used the [func_timeout](https://pypi.org/project/func-timeout/) library, which spins off and monitors its own thread where the target function runs.\r\n\r\nI also improved the error message (see screenshots below), and added logic to disable the \"test connection\" button while the test is in flight. In my initial attempt I added a spinner, but because the main thread is occupied while the test is in flight the spinner doesn't spin.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore, note that an invalid connection to `druid://google.com:8082/druid/v2/sql/` times out only after ~90 seconds:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-01-11 at 8 06 56 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/148978548-85b2b82f-5afd-415f-96e3-3a94896df05e.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter, with `TEST_DATABASE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` set to 2 seconds just for testing:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-01-11 at 7 57 10 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/148977513-4bac3d07-e800-4e05-9934-f976d7795891.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nRecently the psycopg2 version was bumped from 2.8 to 2.9 in #17290, which caused a regression that was fixed in #17713 . However, the psycopg2 versions were not bumped on `setup.py` or on the Helm chart. This updates the version of psycopg2 to 2.9.1 throughout the application, and also fixes the inconsistent redis version (bycatch).\r\n\r\nCloses #17997\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe report modal was only using toasts for responses - error or success - so the user would have to reopen the modal to fix an errored report. The error is now brought into the modal directly and displayed underneath the name field, and will not close until the error is corrected.\r\n\r\nNote: The name field is currently the only field that takes this type of error. The cron scheduler is the only other thing that has an error in this modal, and it has its own separate error handling already set up.\r\n\r\nNote II: I also did some code cleanup in the report modal.\r\n\r\n### ANIMATED MOV\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nThis demonstrates the modal correctly staying open and closing and also keeping correct values in the following events:\r\n- Create new report\r\n  - With error occurring first\r\n- Edit existing report\r\n- Delete existing report\r\n- Create a new report after deleting\r\n  - A clean un-errored creation\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/148836701-411716b2-064d-4b07-b4e9-c805a4f658b0.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Create new report\r\n  - With error occurring first\r\n- Edit existing report\r\n- Delete existing report\r\n- Create a new report after deleting\r\n  - A clean un-errored creation\r\n- Observe that the modal stays open when there's an error and closes when there is not\r\n  - Also observe that the modal keeps all the correct values throughout these events.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [

SUMMARY\r\nSimple change to better alert our users when the default `SECRET_KEY` has not been changed.\r\n\r\nWhen the default SECRET_KEY is detected, superset will log:\r\n```\r\nsuperset_app             | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nsuperset_app             |                                     WARNING\r\nsuperset_app             | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nsuperset_app             | A Default SECRET_KEY was detected please use superset_config.py to override it.\r\nsuperset_app             | Use a strong complex alphanumeric string and use a tool to help you generate\r\nsuperset_app             | a sufficiently random sequence, ex: openssl rand -base64 42\r\nsuperset_app             | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nsuperset_app             | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default `SECRET_KEY` changes to a more standard default, making it more obvious that a change is needed also.\r\nThis can break current installations that were relying on the previous default `SECRET_KEY` I believe this is reasonable, since this is a dangerous setting and a proper setting is imperative. \r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a cli command to help user's migrate their current secrets. They have to set `PREVIOUS_SECRET_KEY` with their old SECRET and set their new secret with `SECRET_KEY` then run `superset re-encrypt-secrets`. Props to @craig-rueda since this script is highly based (adapted) to some work he has done.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFAB 3.4.3 now implements `openapi_spec_component_schemas` ;) this PR removes that functionality from Superset.\r\n\r\nAlso the new version properly uses OpenAPI spec servers with actual servers and we can now define a list of servers for docs, by default the included swagger UI will set the current request host URL.\r\n\r\nSince the spec is not using a base path (`api/v1`) anymore and FAB is not relying on the `resource_name` to infer the spec path but the `route_base` (this used to be a limitation). All endpoints are declared with their full relative path:\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes the OpenAPI spec auto generation for Superset docs, so that all the schema components are not declared with `MetaN` anymore.\r\n \r\nSo these have are not duplicated anymore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1110\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-01-07 at 16 12 40\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4025227/148572461-c3870205-5c95-48cb-b9d4-31594eb191f2.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1182\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-01-07 at 16 11 03\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4025227/148572236-8619ca48-ecd1-432c-98c0-84a9dab4fd45.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"1162\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-01-07 at 16 09 13\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4025227/148571990-4f5d1918-9bc3-4221-afe9-6891b5ae0507.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIn order to publish plugins to `npm` registry, this PR make:\r\n1. add commit message in `lerna.json`\r\n2. update `lerna` from `3.22.1` to `4.0.0`(latest version)\r\n3. move `@superset-ui/plugins` from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` in each `packages.json` of plugins\r\n4. update version of dependency to \"*\" ([Matches any version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#dependencies))\r\n\r\nWhy do we use `matches any version` instead of `exact version`? \r\nIf we use `exact version`, `lerna version` command will update dependency to a new version that doesn't exist in the npm registry. CI will fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently there are a few conflicts in the python dependencies:\r\n- `packaging==23.0` depends on `pyparsing<3`, which causes an error when running`pip-compile-multi`. By upgrading `pyparsing` to the latest stable version we can also upgrade to the latest version of `packaging`.\r\n- `wrapt<1.13` is required by the version of `asteroid` that our current version of `pylint` depends on. Until we bump `pylint` we need to pin `wrapt=1.12.1`.\r\n\r\nAfter these changes running `pip-compile-multi` finishes successfully, and Superset appears to run smoothly. However, I decided not to commit the updated lock files in this PR, as this PR is just intended to fix the version conflicts (we can follow up with a full lock file bump later).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the dependency section in `CONTRIBUTING.md` is updated to reflect the workflows for 1) bumping a single python package 2) bumping all python deps.\r\n \r\n### AFTER\r\n\r\nAfter the changes, bumping the lock files works correctly:\r\n```bash\r\n$ pip-compile-multi\r\nLocking requirements/base.in to requirements/base.txt.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR fix the problem that when user undo delete of a native filter, the options under column is gone. The root cause is due to the **setState** mechanism of the react hook. In the Select component, there is one case that we update the component `selectOptions` which based on the incoming props:\r\n```\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n    fetchedQueries.current.clear();\r\n    setSelectOptions(\r\n      options && Array.isArray(options) ? options : EMPTY_OPTIONS,\r\n    );\r\n    setAllValuesLoaded(false);\r\n}, [options]);\r\n```\r\nand a logic we use `useEffect` to update `selectOptions`:\r\n```\r\n useEffect(() => {\r\n    if (selectValue) {\r\n      // ...\r\n      if (options.length > 0) {\r\n        setSelectOptions([...options, ...selectOptions]);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n}, [labelInValue, isAsync, selectOptions, selectValue]);\r\n```\r\nSo there is a problem that `useEffect` knows the state has changed, but the value taken at this time is still the old value.\r\n\r\nThe solution is we can pass an updater function to transform it so we can use the pending state.  see https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/usestate#passing-an-updater-function-to-setstate.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n### before\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597121/135208961-d9acdead-f57a-4ae7-9283-82e613bf3486.mov\r\n### after\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/148423959-55dca159-b34d-4bc6-9e03-e33ef787c9a2.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, there are multiple ways to import a `value name` from `superset-ui/core`, this confusing import expression makes the codebase difficult to maintain.\r\n\r\n#### You can use following approach in `superset-frontend/src` with Webpack, the config at [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/f75908b1dc075e5a0f697c828f2484051f72ecef/superset-frontend/webpack.config.js#L444)\r\n1. `import { ensureIsArray } from '@superset-ui/core'`\r\n\r\n#### You can use following approach in `superset-frontend/packages/superset-ui-core/test`  with Jest and Eslint, the config at [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/f75908b1dc075e5a0f697c828f2484051f72ecef/superset-frontend/jest.config.js#L32-L37)(Jest) and [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/f75908b1dc075e5a0f697c828f2484051f72ecef/superset-frontend/.eslintrc.js#L64-L66)(Eslint).\r\n1. `import { ensureIsArray } from '@superset-ui/core'`\r\n2. `import { ensureIsArray } from '@superset-ui/core/src/utils/ensureIsArray'`\r\n3. `import { ensureIsArray } from '../../some/relative/path'`\r\n\r\nThis PR enforces the codebase using unified import expression: `import { ensureIsArray } from '@superset-ui/core'`. If you want to import an internal(private) module from '@superset-ui/core', you should use relative import and export the corresponding value name.\r\n\r\n#### after the PR, `eslint` rules will prevent following import expression\r\n1.  ‚ùå `import { ensureIsArray } from '@superset-ui/core/src/some/path`\r\n2.  ‚ùå `import { testValueName } from '@superset-ui/core/test/some/path`\r\n3.  ‚ùå `import { valueNameFromLib }` from `@superset-ui/core/lib/some/path`\r\n\r\n#### after the PR, `eslint` rules will approve following import expression\r\n1. ‚úîÔ∏è  `import { ensureIsArray } from '@superset-ui/core'`\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
