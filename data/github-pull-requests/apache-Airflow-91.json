Copying of a venv is a metadata heavy load: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-storage/files-troubleshoot-performance?tabs=linux#cause-2-metadata-or-namespace-heavy-workload.\r\n\r\nIntroducing a startupProbe onto the airflow services would be useful for slow starting container and most of all it doesn't have side effects. startupProbe has been added for scheduler and the webserver following the same flow as their respective liveness and readiness probes. A gracious value of 10 mins has been set for startup. This is based on personal experiments where our deployments took 5 - 6 mins for startup roughly, 10 mins allows some head room. Although, these properties are configurable and would be beneficial for users to use them.\r\n\r\ncloses: #33099 \r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add

openlineage provider has apache-airflow >= 2.7.0 as dependency, and this is a problem for automated constraint generation. Since there is only one version of the provider released, it's the only one that can be installed from PyPI, but until apache-airflow 2.7.0 is released it cannot be installed because of the dependency missing.\r\n\r\nThis makes calculating of the constraints by PyPI impossible and it loops in continuously trying to find a solution that cannot be found.\r\n\r\nIn order to unblock constraint generation we need to exclude the provider temporarily and regenerate the constraints again when airflow 2.7.0 gets released (which will generally only bring the open-lineage provider as part of the constraints).\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit b08188e24bf7e52a0b700e083caa38347a4fa3fc)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

the Triggerer was forced to a health check threshold of `trigger_heartbeat * 2.1` with a default of 5s for the heartbeat (as of #32123), this generates a threshold of 10.5s, the previous threshold was 30s, this leads to us observing a very unstable situation in many Airflow environments where Triggerers are not given a reasonable amount of time to heartbeat and their triggers are taken from them and given to another \"healthy\" Triggerer. This repeats back and fourth between multiple Triggerers.\r\n\r\nThis change allows the user to configure this threshold the same way we do for the scheduler.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

that Triggerer heartbeat is configurable (via #32123), the heartbeat set on Job must use the correct config source, either Scheduler or Triggerer depending on the Job.\r\n\r\nThis is noticeable in the health check apis for example. If one increased the heartrate of the Triggerer to 10s and left the scheduler at the default of 5s, one should expected heartbeats of up to heartrate*2.1 seconds (so 21s) to be acceptable for the triggerer, but instead we see in the UI a warning dialog which indicates that the last heartbeat was received 13s ago and throws the warning (this shows that it is using the default 5s seconds from the scheduler not the updated 10s seconds on the triggerer).\r\n\r\n![image (15)](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/65743084/15974a33-f7c9-44ab-8dd5-d0ee48727759)\r\n\r\n# NOTE:\r\nThis change moves the heartbeat from a class attribute to a cached property. All tests pass and it's working correctly from what I can see. But I'm interested to hear form folks who have historical context on Job.py to double check this and let me know if they are aware of any gotchas with this approach.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

a serialized mapped operator's unmapped SerializedOperator misses some DAG-level references because they were established separately in BaseSerialization and were overlooked when the unmap() function was implemented. This extracts those post-population ref-fixing code into a function, and call it as needed in unmap(), so an unmapped SerializedOperator is consistent with a non-mapped SerializedOperator that comes straightly out of a database.\r\n\r\nThis was not an issue prior to 2.6 since the scheduler mostly did not access DAG-level references on a serialized operator (mapped or not). The introduction of the fail_fast flag requires accessing the DAG much later in a task's lifetime in the scheduler, and thus needs the references to be properly set.","created_at":"2023-08-03T19:23:21Z","updated_at":"2023-08-04T10:46:34Z","closed_at":"2023-08-04T04:40:44Z","merged_at":"2023-08-04T04:40:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"bcfadcf6e4b2de587959594f54a9e8fef96c4a2b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769805151,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5ODA1MTUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:serialization","name":"area:serialization","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172800850,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwODUw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:improvement","name":"type:improvement","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

is observed that `urljoin` is not yielding expected results \r\nfor the task instance's `log_url` which needs to be a \r\nconcatenation of the webserver `base_url` and specified \r\nrelative url. The current usage of `urljoin` does not seem \r\nto be the right way to achieve this based on what `urljoin` \r\nis meant for and how it works. So, we use simple string \r\nconcatenation to yield the desired result.\r\nMore context in the comment https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/31833#discussion_r1282696916\r\n\r\ncloses: #32996\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

working with `log_url` property of the task instances, \r\nit is observed that `urljoin` ignores the part of the path after \r\nthe last slash specified in the base_url when it does not end \r\nwith a trailing slash and Airflow webserver does not allow \r\nsetting the base_url with a trailing slash. Additionally, it is also \r\nobserved that if the relative URL has a leading slash, `urljoin` \r\njust ingores the base URL and returns the relative URL. \r\nHence, we add a new utlity method `safe_urljoin` to handle \r\nthese cases.\r\n\r\ncloses: #32996\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

currently deploy lots of Airflow clusters with different branches like below\r\n- `prod` Airflow (synced with `develop` branch)\r\n- `beta` Airflow (synced also with `develop` branch, but use another configuration on same connection name and [AirflowClusterPolicySkipDag exeception](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/32013))\r\n- lots of individual Airflow cluster with small resources (synced with different feature branches, deployed on k8s with our custom `Airflow` CRD and controller. Every developer making DAG can create his/her own Airflow from web UI plugin of `prod`/`beta` Airflow)\r\n\r\nWhen we used `KubernetesPodOperator` with lots of Airflow deployments like above, we often encountered the exceptions raised from the code below, because, multiple Airflow can submit pod creation requests with same labels and spec in same namespace.\r\n```\r\n    def find_pod(self, namespace: str, context: Context, *, exclude_checked: bool = True) -> k8s.V1Pod | None:\r\n        \"\"\"Returns an already-running pod for this task instance if one exists.\"\"\"\r\n        label_selector = self._build_find_pod_label_selector(context, exclude_checked=exclude_checked)\r\n        pod_list = self.client.list_namespaced_pod(\r\n            namespace=namespace,\r\n            label_selector=label_selector,\r\n        ).items\r\n\r\n        pod = None\r\n        num_pods = len(pod_list)\r\n        if num_pods > 1:\r\n            raise AirflowException(f\"More than one pod running with labels {label_selector}\")\r\n        elif num_pods == 1:\r\n            pod = pod_list[0]\r\n            self.log.info(\"Found matching pod %s with labels %s\", pod.metadata.name, pod.metadata.labels)\r\n            self.log.info(\"`try_number` of task_instance: %s\", context[\"ti\"].try_number)\r\n            self.log.info(\"`try_number` of pod: %s\", pod.metadata.labels[\"try_number\"])\r\n        return pod\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I decided to use `labels` argument to differentiate multiple pods requested from different Airflow clusters\r\n```\r\n:param labels: labels to apply to the Pod. (templated)\r\n```\r\nBut, I noticed this `labels` argument only handled on pod creation logic, and not on pod finding logic.\r\n\r\nI think it is more consistent to handle this `labels` argument, also on the pod finding logic.","created_at":"2023-08-03T03:12:49Z","updated_at":"2023-08-04T18:41:22Z","closed_at":"2023-08-04T18:41:22Z","merged_at":"2023-08-04T18:41:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"164526d4c798a72dba3087d71f30f60f60595b0e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2504183113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTA0MTgzMTEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:cncf-kubernetes","name":"provider:cncf-kubernetes","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Kubernetes

PR makes the ground-work to a follow-up PR #33017\r\n\r\nI realized that the providers-manager is implemented inconsistently and treats core hooks other than provider contributed hooks. Core hooks are not providing extended web UI fields (feature is ignored) as well as the list of provided generic hooks is redundant in CLI and UI code.\r\n\r\nThis PR cleans this up and:\r\n\r\n- Treats Airflow core hooks like provider hooks in terms on loading and initialization\r\n- Implements UI feature for FileSystem hook (so that a user does not need to provide JSON dict)\r\n- Removed redundant hard-coded lists from CLI and UI code\r\n\r\nPoint of discussion would be if we still should further carry the generic hook type \"Mesos Framework ID\" which seems to be a legacy leftover from Airflow 1.x. This was a former executor type but the code is gone completely since Airflow 2.0 and besides the traces in code I could find no reference. I assume nobody is using this anymore.\r\n\r\nHow to test:\r\n\r\n- Pipeline green obviously\r\n- Open the Web UI connections form and see that \"File (Path)\" connection type now has a proper form","created_at":"2023-08-02T20:37:02Z","updated_at":"2023-10-28T08:22:43Z","closed_at":"2023-08-06T14:42:31Z","merged_at":"2023-08-06T14:42:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"3461a23e773deb101f536c4df98bd9e1065137c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

intent of this PR is to move FAB related methods from security managers ([AirflowSecurityManager](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/www/security.py), [BaseSecurityManager](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/www/fab_security/manager.py) and [SecurityManager](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/www/fab_security/sqla/manager.py)) to `FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride`. Since the effort is quite big, this PR is just a first step and more methods will be moved in separate PRs. This PR moves the most \"obvious\" methods to be moved. This will help to review the PR as well.\r\n\r\nAlso, in order to avoid having one gigantic `FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride`, I decided to split it in different modules which `FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride` inherits from. So far I created two modules: `DB` and `oauth`, each one defining methods related to either the database or Oauth.\r\n\r\nThere is no new code in this PR, the changes are only code being moved around.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

language that warned about not using the embedded postgres for\r\nproduction in our Helm Chart was not strong enough. It only \"advised\"\r\nto use external database, but really the embedded Postgres lacks\r\nall the the things that you need when you want to make sure your\r\nproduction deployment is \"safe\" - persistency, monitoring, backup,\r\nupgrade scenarios are all missing.\r\n\r\nI think we should be much stronger in saying \"data loss might occur\"\r\n\"you SHOULD NOT\" use it for production. This is much more realistic\r\nwarning and it makes it easier for us to direct users who have\r\nproblems with embedded postgres to use \"real\" database for production.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Allow this to be configurable through config so that every webserver installation can have a custom message without changing the airflow code.\r\n\r\nNote: This message is not per call to the `has_access` function, but per webserver installation which is a more realistic case.\r\n\r\nTook suggestions from community and approached the problem accordingly.\r\n- Made a function

PR adds the option to specify extra index URLs to PythonVirtualEnvOperator (+corresponding decorator) in order to be able to install virtualenvs with (private) additional Python package repositories.\r\n\r\nBesides the option to modify the worker config or adding ENVs to specify additional PIP install configs, this allows to use different back-ends per DAG/Task.\r\n\r\nAs the definition of (private) extra index URLs might require credentials to be passed, using plain requirements or pip install options would expose passwords as secrets in logs. Therefore the Airflow core provided connection types were extended to contain a \"Package Index (Python)\" connection type that can be used to store the credentials in Airflow in a (more) secret way and preventing to expose.\r\n\r\nSummary of changes, separated by commit:\r\n- Added a Package Index (Python) hook\r\n- Extended PythonVirtualEnvOperator for extra index URL and caching\r\n\r\nNote: The PR was based on a discussion in Slack in https://apache-airflow.slack.com/archives/CCPRP7943/p1684608779378759\r\nNote (2): Caching of venvs was separated in a follow-up PR https://github.com/boschglobal/airflow/pull/2\r\n\r\nHow and what to test:\r\n- Pipeline green obviously\r\n- Open the Web UI connections form and see that a new connection type \"Package Index (Python)\" is available (with proper form)\r\n- Take a look to docs and check with a DAG, e.g. use example_python_operator and modify some parameters and try the new options\r\n- Review the added RST docs\r\n\r\n@AutomationDev85 @clellmann

for `DataprocSubmitJobOperator` system tests (PySpark, SparkR jobs).\r\n\r\nDynamic creation of the job file was replaced by pulling it from the public GCS bucket `airflow-system-tests-resources`.

If these two tasks run in different workers, then tests fail because the second task can't find the file.\r\n2. After refactoring tests look shorter and simpler.

dask_executor backfill tests started to fail recently more often due\r\nto backfill exception, and the likely cause for it is that it is now\r\nbetter parallelise execution and triggering of the deadlocks because of\r\ncontention betwee dag_run state update and task state update had\r\nbecome much easier.\r\n\r\nWhile this PR does not fix the underlying issue, it catches the\r\noperational error where the deadlock occured during the backfill.\r\nand rolls back the operation.\r\n\r\nThis **should** be safe. backfil has a built-in mechanism to loop and\r\nretry failed tasks and the test passed multiple times, completing the\r\nbackfill after this fix was applied. It was not easy to reproduce it\r\nlocally but it failed every 20-30 times. When extra logging was added,\r\nit was always connected to OperationalException raised (and caught)\r\nright after _per_task_process. The same exception was observed few times\r\nwhen rollback was added, and despite it backfill job retried and\r\ncompleted the process successfully every time. We also leave the logs\r\nwith exceptions and add reassuring messages that should make it clear\r\nthat in case backfill completes, the exceptions can be ignored as\r\nthe updates will be retried by the backfill job.\r\n\r\nFixes: #32778\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

have an automated system-test pytest marker that applies the pytest.mark.system marker to all system tests. It has been implemented in a strange way as it was applying the marker to all provider tests if the whole \"tests\" directory was used for test collection.\r\n\r\nThis caused quarantine tests from providers folder to be skipped because they were automatically marked with pytest.mark.system marker.\r\n\r\nAlso system tests were generally excluded from running after we brought back the \"test_*\" prefix.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the auto-marker to only apply system marker to tests in \"system/providers\" folder and adds the \"example_*\" prefix to the prefixes automatically collected by pytest.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

On Airflow CI, we have experienced many failures in the CI with no logs/explanations, one possible reasoning is this test.\r\n\r\nQuoting @potiuk here in a Slack conversation to give more details:\r\n\r\n> I think I see a slightly bigger number of jobs which are mystreriously “failed” in CI without logs and my hunch tells me that we also experience this race condition but the way how Github Actions works - if the test hangs without accepting test timout, the logs from that Github Action job are lost when the job is forcefully killed by GA framework on job timeout.\r\n\r\ncc @potiuk , @o-nikolas \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
