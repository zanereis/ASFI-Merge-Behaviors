Reusing `SparkContext._ensure_initialized`\r\n2. Separating the configuration groups to be set by default or overwrite\r\n3. Piggyback a fix of removing `connect_not_compiled_message` which is useless in fact because Spark Connect jars are always compiled together by default `sbt package` or `mvn package`\r\n\r\n### Why are

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpdate `SparkBuild.scala` to force SBT use of `protobuf-java` to match the Maven version.  The Maven dependencyManagement section forces `protobuf-java` to use `2.5.0`, but SBT is using `3.14.0`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDefine `protoVersion` in `SparkBuild.scala` and use it in `DependencyOverrides` to force the SBT version of `protobuf-java` to match the setting defined in the Maven top-level `pom.xml`.  Add comments to both `pom.xml` and `SparkBuild.scala` to ensure that the values are kept in sync. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpdate `SparkBuild.scala` to force SBT use of `protobuf-java` to match the Maven version.  The Maven dependencyManagement section forces `protobuf-java` to use `2.5.0`, but SBT is using `3.14.0`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDefine `protoVersion` in `SparkBuild.scala` and use it in `DependencyOverrides` to force the SBT version of `protobuf-java` to match the setting defined in the Maven top-level `pom.xml`.  Add comments to both `pom.xml` and `SparkBuild.scala` to ensure that the values are kept in sync. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBefore the update, SBT reported using `3.14.0`:\r\n```\r\n% build/sbt dependencyTree | grep proto | sed 's/^.*-com/com/' | sort | uniq -c\r\n   8 com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java:2.5.0 (evicted by: 3.14.0)\r\n  70 com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java:3.14.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the patch is applied, SBT reports using `2.5.0`:\r\n```\r\n% build/sbt dependencyTree | grep proto | sed 's/^.*-com/com/' | sort | uniq -c\r\n  70 com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java:2.5.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n  \r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSort order for left and right cogroups must be resolved against left and right plan, respectively. Otherwise, ambiguous reference exception can be thrown.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n#39640 added sorted groups for `flatMapGroups` and `cogroup`. Sort order for the `cogroup` can be ambiguous when resolved against all children of `CoGroup`:\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\nleftGroupedDf.cogroup(rightGroupedDf)($\"time\")($\"time\") { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nGrouped DataFrames `leftGroupedDf` and `rightGroupedDf` both contain column `\"time\"`. Left and right sort order `$\"time\"` is ambiguous when resolved against all children. They must be resolved against left or right child, exclusively.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis fixes errors like\r\n\r\n    [AMBIGUOUS_REFERENCE] Reference `time` is ambiguous, could be: [`time`, `time`].\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested in `AnalysisSuite` on `Analyzer` level, and E2E in `DatasetSuite`.","created_at":"2023-01-25T14:06:15Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T02:06:18Z","closed_at":"2023-01-30T02:06:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d368cdc1860f685ceee72a32dce41bce70f0d530","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39744/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39744/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39744/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2f4afd03b2c0a70335740816dd3c072629e637b4","head":{"label":"G-Research:branch-sorted-groups-ambiguous-reference","ref":"branch-sorted-groups-ambiguous-reference","sha":"2f4afd03b2c0a70335740816dd3c072629e637b4","user":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":214350064,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQzNTAwNjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"G-Research/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use `pyspark.sql.SparkSession.getOrCreate` instead of `pyspark.sql.connect.Sparksession.builder.getOrCreate`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause `pyspark.sql.connect.Sparksession.builder.getOrCreate` is supposed to be internal, and it does not have the unified handling of the Spark sessions for both PySpark session and Spark Connect sessions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests fixed.","created_at":"2023-01-25T13:41:03Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:49:00Z","closed_at":"2023-01-26T04:33:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"73accb2742d9c8e635828ed8914daf51433fb36c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39743/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39743/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39743/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9e315a69619a86c689b961d42088f66912c6628c","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:cleanup-test","ref":"cleanup-test","sha":"9e315a69619a86c689b961d42088f66912c6628c","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to allow to stop SparkR session even when the connection is timed-out.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPreviously, when the connection is timed out from the R backend, it was unable to stop and restart the session to recover as below:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/sparkR --conf spark.r.backendConnectionTimeout=10\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter waiting 10 seconds\r\n\r\n```R\r\n...\r\n23/01/25 21:24:53 WARN RBackendHandler: Ignoring read timeout in RBackendHandler\r\n> sparkR.session()\r\nError in handleErrors(returnStatus, conn) :\r\n  No status is returned. Java SparkR backend might have failed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```R\r\n> sparkR.session.stop()\r\nError in writeBin(requestMessage, conn) : ignoring SIGPIPE signal\r\n```\r\n\r\n```R\r\n> sparkR.session()\r\nError in handleErrors(returnStatus, conn) :\r\n  No status is returned. Java SparkR backend might have failed.\r\nIn addition: Warning message:\r\nIn writeBin(requestMessage, conn) : problem writing to connection\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this change, we can stop and restart to continue using SparkR below:\r\n\r\n```R\r\n...\r\n23/01/25 21:35:21 WARN RBackendHandler: Ignoring read timeout in RBackendHandler\r\n> sparkR.session()\r\nError in handleErrors(returnStatus, conn) :\r\n  No status is returned.

It is difficult to write a unittest.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-25T12:41:12Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:49:01Z","closed_at":"2023-01-25T17:13:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3b3fd4e7dcaec103df9ee28a8642e2a736e614b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1984361638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0MzYxNjM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/R","name":"R","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39742/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39742/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39742/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5d6adade201124d56b9a219311ee83f0fc8042b7","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-42186","ref":"SPARK-42186","sha":"5d6adade201124d56b9a219311ee83f0fc8042b7","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAccept return type in DDL strings for Python Scalar UDFs in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\nThe approach proposed in this PR is a workaround to parse DataType from DDL strings. We should think of a more elegant alternative to replace that later.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo reach parity with vanilla PySpark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Return type in DDL strings are accepted now.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPySpark's `DataFrame.__getattr__` and `DataFrame.__getitem__` invokes `jc = self._jdf.apply(name)` in JVM, which resolve the column name and

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe PR fixes an issue when casting a boolean to timestamp. \r\n\r\nWhile `select cast(true as timestamp)` works and returns `1970-01-01 00:00:00.000001`, casting `false` to timestamp fails with the following error:\r\n> IllegalArgumentException: requirement failed: Literal must have a corresponding value to timestamp, but class Integer found.\r\n\r\nSBT test also fails with this error:\r\n```\r\n[info]   java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.Long\r\n[info]   at scala.runtime.BoxesRunTime.unboxToLong(BoxesRunTime.java:107)\r\n[info]   at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.InternalRow$.$anonfun$getWriter$5(InternalRow.scala:178)\r\n[info]   at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.InternalRow$.$anonfun$getWriter$5$adapted(InternalRow.scala:178)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue was that we need to return `0L` instead of `0` when converting `false` to a long.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes a small bug in cast.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added a unit test to verify the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen constructing an RpcAddress use InetUtils to get a consistently formatted IPv6 address if the env is for an IPv6 address.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe use RpcAddress equality for various tasks involving executors and a mismatch of equality can cause interesting errors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nLog messages might change from sometimes having all the 0s in a v6 address present to not.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests + new unit test showing that

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `ignoredBlockBytes` of server side metrics for push-based shuffle does not fully capture the block bytes that were received by ESS but didn't get merged. This PR tries to enhance the logic of  incrementing `ignoredBlockBytes`, to capture those bytes being ignored by ESS. Specifically, the bytes being considered as ignored should be 1. received after the shuffle file is finalized; 2. when a request is for a duplicate block; 3. the bytes ESS received but failed to write.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis would enhance the `ignoredBlockBytes` of server side metrics for push-based shuffle to be more accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nModified existing UTs to capture

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- This PR introduces a new expression called `MultiCommutativeOp` which is used by the commutative expressions (e.g., `Add`, `Multiply`, `And`, `Or`, `BitwiseOr`, `BitwiseAnd`, `BitwiseXor`) during canonicalization.\r\n- During canonicalization, when there is a list of consecutive commutative expressions, we now create a MultiCommutative expression with references to original operands, instead of creating new objects.\r\n- This new expression is added as a memory optimization to reduce generating a large number of intermediate objects during canonicalization.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- With the [recent changes](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37851) in the expression canonicalization, a complex query with a large number of commutative operations could end up consuming significantly more (sometimes > 10X) memory on the executors.\r\n- In our case, this issue happens for a specific complex query that has a huge expression tree containing Add operators interleaved by non Add operators.\r\n- The issue is related to canonicalization and why it is causing issues in the executors is because the codegen component relies on expression canonicalization to deduplicate expressions. \r\n- When we have a large number of Adds interleaved by non-Add operators, [this line](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37851/files#diff-7278f2db37934522ee7c74b71525153234cff245cefaf996957e4a9ff3dbaacdR1171) ends up materializing a new canonicalized expression tree at every non-Add operator.\r\n- In our case, analyzing the executor heap histogram shows that the additional memory is consumed by a large number of Add objects.\r\n- The high memory usage causes the executors to lose heartbeat signals and results in task failures.\r\n- The proposed `MultiCommutativeOp` expression avoids generating new Add expressions and keeps the extra memory usage to a minimum.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n- No\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Existing unit tests and new unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`YearMonthIntervalType` case was missed in `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.Analyzer.ResolveBinaryArithmetic` class. \r\nBecause of that, such kind of queries:\r\n`spark.sql(\"select '2022-02-01' - interval 1 year\")` \r\n`spark.sql(\"select '2022-02-01' + interval 1 year\")` \r\nwere failing.\r\n\r\nThem are failing since **Spark 3.2.0 version**. \r\nIn the earlier versions the queries was working...\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the interval related operations (add/subtract years/months) bug.\r\n\r\nCurrent error message:\r\n`org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve '(CAST('2022-02-01' AS DOUBLE) - INTERVAL '1' YEAR)' due to data type mismatch: differing types in '(CAST('2022-02-01' AS DOUBLE) - INTERVAL '1' YEAR)' (double and interval year).; line 1 pos 7;\r\n'Project [unresolvedalias((cast(2022-02-01 as double) - INTERVAL '1' YEAR), None)]`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it allows users to use interval related operations (add/subtract years/months) again.\r\nAlso, because of this change, some error messages were changed:\r\n- `UNEXPECTED_INPUT_TYPE` -> `BINARY_OP_DIFF_TYPES` (when trying to add/subtract different interval types, like `INTERVAL '2' YEAR + INTERVAL '02' SECOND`)\r\n- `BINARY_OP_DIFF_TYPES` ->  `UNEXPECTED_INPUT_TYPE` (when trying to add/subtract an interval from some value, like `1 + INTERVAL '2' MONTH`)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAn additional test case was added to `org.apache.spark.sql.DateFunctionsSuite` class\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-24T16:37:30Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T15:24:18Z","closed_at":"2023-01-30T15:24:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"71fed36b9c013db885b4d3a84ccce0422af23e27","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39720/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39720/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39720/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/357c82141fa1a666b25bc4e3414b2fd5e0bcb8fd","head":{"label":"NarekDW:SPARK-41500","ref":"SPARK-41500","sha":"357c82141fa1a666b25bc4e3414b2fd5e0bcb8fd","user":{"login":"NarekDW","id":24260474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjYwNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24260474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW","html_url":"https://github.com/NarekDW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":573114199,"node_id":"R_kgDOIikHVw","name":"spark","full_name":"NarekDW/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NarekDW","id":24260474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjYwNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24260474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW","html_url":"https://github.com/NarekDW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NarekDW/spark","description":"Apache

It looks through GetArrayItem/GetMapItem, but when doing so, it ignores the index/key, which may itself be a struct field. If it is a struct field that is not selected in some other expression, and another field of the same attribute is selected, then pruning will drop the field, resulting in an optimizer error.\r\n\r\nThis change modifies SelectedField to only look through GetArrayItem/GetMapItem if the index/key argument is foldable. The equivalent code for `ElementAt` was already doing the same thing, so this just makes them consistent.\r\n\r\nIn principle, we could continue to traverse through these expressions, we'd just need to make sure that the index/key expression was also surfaced to column pruning as an expression that needs to be examined. But this seems like a fairly non-trivial change to the design of the SelectedField class.\r\n\r\nThere is some risk that the current approach could result in a regression e.g. if there is an existing GetArrayItem that is being successfully pruned, where a non-foldable index argument happens to not trigger an error (because it is not a struct field, or it is preserved due to some other expression).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAllows queries that previously would fail in the optimizer to pass.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, as described above, there could be a performance regression if a query was previously pruning through a GetArrayItem/GetMapItem, and happened to not fail.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test included in patch, fails without the patch and passes with it.","created_at":"2023-01-24T15:03:02Z","updated_at":"2023-02-03T08:54:34Z","closed_at":"2023-01-31T02:16:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"24d85e8dbcb5ba61b7e979ee8b6de8abd986d03c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39718/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39718/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39718/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/778d912cbb15217a3849eab6b7f1cf0cf297b1a0","head":{"label":"cashmand:fix_selected_field","ref":"fix_selected_field","sha":"778d912cbb15217a3849eab6b7f1cf0cf297b1a0","user":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":469837514,"node_id":"R_kgDOHAEmyg","name":"spark","full_name":"cashmand/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve `GitHub Action` **lint** job to stop on failure earlier.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, we designed to put all installation steps before testing.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improves error messages for `ARRAY` / `MAP` / `STRUCT` types without element type specification. A new error class `INCOMPLETE_TYPE_DEFINITION` with subclasses (`ARRAY`, `MAP`, and `STRUCT`) is introduced.\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\n\r\nIn the case where we do `CAST AS` or `CREATE` a complex type without specifying its element type,\r\ne.g.\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t (col ARRAY)\r\n```\r\n`[UNSUPPORTED_DATATYPE] Unsupported data type \"ARRAY\"` error would be thrown, while we do support the `ARRAY` type and just require it to be typed.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a better error message like \r\n```\r\nThe definition of `ARRAY` type is incomplete. You must provide an element type. For example: `ARRAY<elementType>`.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe previous error message for incomplete complex types is confusing. A `UNSUPPORTED_DATATYPE` error would be thrown, while we do support complex types. We just require complex types to have their element types specified. We need a clear error message with an example in this case.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR changes the error message which is user-facing.\r\n\r\nError message before this PR:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> SELECT CAST(array(1, 2, 3) AS ARRAY);\r\n\r\n[UNSUPPORTED_DATATYPE] Unsupported data type \"ARRAY\"(line 1, pos 30)\r\n```\r\n\r\nError message after this PR:\r\n```\r\n[INCOMPLETE_TYPE_DEFINITION.ARRAY] Incomplete complex type: The definition of `ARRAY` type is incomplete. You must provide an element type. For example: `ARRAY<elementType>`.\r\n```\r\nSimilarly for MAP and STRUCT types.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests covering CAST and CREATE with ARRAY / STRUCT / MAP types and their nested combinations.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request? This PR introduces sasl retry count in RetryingBlockTransferor.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPreviously a boolean variable, saslTimeoutSeen, was used. However, the boolean variable wouldn't cover the following scenario:\r\n\r\n1. SaslTimeoutException\r\n2. IOException\r\n3. SaslTimeoutException\r\n4. IOException\r\n\r\nEven though IOException at #2 is retried (resulting in increment of retryCount), the retryCount would be cleared at step #4. Since the intention of saslTimeoutSeen is to undo the increment due to retrying SaslTimeoutException, we should keep a counter for SaslTimeoutException retries and subtract the value of this counter from retryCount.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change? No\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew test is added, courtesy of Mridul.\r\n\r\nCloses #39611 from tedyu/sasl-cnt.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Ted Yu <yuzhihong@gmail.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Mridul

What changes were proposed in this pull request? This PR introduces sasl retry count in RetryingBlockTransferor.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPreviously a boolean variable, saslTimeoutSeen, was used. However, the boolean variable wouldn't cover the following scenario:\r\n\r\n1. SaslTimeoutException\r\n2. IOException\r\n3. SaslTimeoutException\r\n4. IOException\r\n\r\nEven though IOException at #2 is retried (resulting in increment of retryCount), the retryCount would be cleared at step #4. Since the intention of saslTimeoutSeen is to undo the increment due to retrying SaslTimeoutException, we should keep a counter for SaslTimeoutException retries and subtract the value of this counter from retryCount.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change? No\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew test is added, courtesy of Mridul.\r\n\r\nCloses #39611 from tedyu/sasl-cnt.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Ted Yu <yuzhihong@gmail.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Mridul

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38950, to make sure we run all tests in the suite with `spark.sql.sources.v2.bucketing.pushPartValues.enabled` on and off.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo increase test coverage. As the config `spark.sql.sources.v2.bucketing.pushPartValues.enabled` changes, the test results would change accordingly, so we should make sure the suite covers both cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, this is just test related change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBy default all exceptions thrown via the GRPC service are treated as fatal. However, this is not always the case and exceptions that are returning an GRPC Status code of \"UNAVAILABLE\" should be retried.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds support for retrying \"UNAVAILABLE\" errors and builds a default retry policy in the Python client that can be further modified and configured if necessary. The retry policy is a simple exponential backoff policy with jitter.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nStability\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `QUALIFY` clause is used to filter the results of [window functions](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-window.html). For example:\r\n```sql\r\n-- QUALIFY with window functions in the SELECT list.\r\nSELECT\r\n  city,\r\n  car_model,\r\n  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY car_model ORDER BY quantity) AS rank\r\nFROM dealer\r\nQUALIFY rank = 1;\r\n\r\n-- QUALIFY with window functions in the QUALIFY clause.\r\nSELECT city, car_model\r\nFROM dealer\r\nQUALIFY RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY car_model ORDER BY quantity) = 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo easily migrate SQL queries to Spark SQL.\r\n\r\nThe following databases support this clause:\r\nhttps://docs.databricks.com/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-qualify.html\r\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constructs/qualify.html\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#qualify_clause\r\nhttps://duckdb.org/docs/sql/query_syntax/qualify.html\r\nhttps://docs.teradata.com/reader/2_MC9vCtAJRlKle2Rpb0mA/19NnI91neorAi7LX6SJXBw\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIntroduce a new wrapper class for comparable InternalRow (returned by `HasPartitionKey`, with datatype) and remove `InternalRowSet` for easy `groupBy`, `Set`, `Map` and other operations.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently SPJ (Storage-Partitioned Join) actually assumes the `InternalRow` returned by `HasPartitionKey` implements equals and hashCode. We should remove this restriction.\r\nFor example, see [comments](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6371/files#r1056852402) in Iceberg  [StructInternalRow](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/spark/v3.3/spark/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/spark/source/StructInternalRow.java#L362) should implements equals and hashCode. see .

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR ensures that SparkR serializes `NA` dates as `\"NA\"` (string) to avoid an undefined length when deserializing in the JVM.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, SparkR assumes that a `NegativeArraySizeException` when deserializing dates and timestamps represents an `NA`.  However, this handling can be made more robust by ensuring that serialization on the R side always provides a valid string length (note that `nchar(as.character(as.Date(NA)))` is `NA`).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to enable `spark.kryo.unsafe` by default at Apache Spark 3.4. This configuration was introduced at Apache Spark 2.1.0 and has been used.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/66f6a63b4ae00607b7a3d44371d379bbe1374569/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/Kryo.scala#L41-L44\r\n\r\nNote that this is used only inside `KryoSerializer` class which is still disabled by default. New behavior will be used only when the user sets `KryoSerializer` explicitly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo help a user use `KroSerializer` more easily by setting `spark.serializer=org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer`.\r\n\r\nApache Spark provides the benchmark result already.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/66f6a63b4ae00607b7a3d44371d379bbe1374569/core/benchmarks/KryoBenchmark-jdk11-results.txt#L1-L26\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is still behind `spark.serializer` configuration which is unchanged.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR converts the existing HyperLogLogPlusPlus case class into a trait, and adds a set of case classes which extend that trait and provide new functionality to generate/evaluate/aggregate the serialized version of the HLL++ sketch.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese additional functions are being added to support HLL++ re-aggregation, which can provide significant performance improvements when running distinct counts over time series datasets.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this PR adds two new aggregate functions, approx_count_distinct_sketch and approx_count_distinct_agg_sketch. This PR also introduces a non-aggregate function approx_count_distinct_eval_sketch.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests were added to the HyperLogLogPlusPlusSuite and the DataFrameAggregateSuite to test sketch generation, evaluation, and aggregation.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-20T18:02:28Z","updated_at":"2023-05-03T20:29:12Z","closed_at":"2023-05-03T20:29:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a8ac7706806d8b3978a621824ff538accf718a9b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39678/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39678/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39678/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/960982f87c6da0e91ed633035dfdeee9488776d6","head":{"label":"RyanBerti:add-hll-sketch-functions","ref":"add-hll-sketch-functions","sha":"960982f87c6da0e91ed633035dfdeee9488776d6","user":{"login":"RyanBerti","id":17288675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjg4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17288675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti","html_url":"https://github.com/RyanBerti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":583148820,"node_id":"R_kgDOIsIlFA","name":"spark","full_name":"RyanBerti/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RyanBerti","id":17288675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjg4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17288675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti","html_url":"https://github.com/RyanBerti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RyanBerti/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a small correctness fix to `DataSourceUtils.getPartitionFiltersAndDataFilters()` to handle filters without any referenced attributes correctly. E.g. without the fix the following query on ParquetV2 source:\r\n```\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.sources.useV1SourceList\", \"\")\r\nspark.range(1).write.mode(\"overwrite\").format(\"parquet\").save(path)\r\ndf = spark.read.parquet(path).toDF(\"i\")\r\nf = udf(lambda x: False, \"boolean\")(lit(1))\r\nval r = df.filter(f)\r\nr.show()\r\n```\r\nreturns\r\n```\r\n+---+\r\n|  i|\r\n+---+\r\n|  0|\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\nbut it should return with empty results.\r\nThe root cause of the issue is that during `V2ScanRelationPushDown` a filter that doesn't reference any column is incorrectly identified as partition filter.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix a correctness issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, fixes a correctness issue.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UT.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-20T13:59:24Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T10:59:18Z","closed_at":"2023-01-21T02:35:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3df5891cb4d6e2b65068a9823a9396051afeb26c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39676/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39676/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39676/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2ea5445205bc25bf339b3dcfa491cf2835a82b17","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-42134-fix-getpartitionfiltersanddatafilters","ref":"SPARK-42134-fix-getpartitionfiltersanddatafilters","sha":"2ea5445205bc25bf339b3dcfa491cf2835a82b17","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe env `SPARK_USE_CONC_INCR_GC` use to enable CMS GC for Yarn AM, but user can achieve the same goal by directly configuring `spark.driver.extraJavaOptions(cluster mode)` or `spark.yarn.am.extraJavaOptions(client mode)` and this env is not exposed to users in any user documents.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Java 14 starts to remove support for CMS([JEP-363](https://openjdk.org/jeps/363)). So when we use Java 17 to run Spark and set `SPARK_USE_CONC_INCR_GC=true`, CMS will not take effect (No error be reported due to `-XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions` is configured by default).\r\n\r\nThis pr aims to remove this env and a similar commented out code in `yarn.ExecutorRunnable` for code cleanup.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up an env `SPARK_USE_CONC_INCR_GC` that is not exposed to users in the any document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, env `SPARK_USE_CONC_INCR_GC` is no longer

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis deduplicate attributes that exist on both sides of a `CoGroup` by aliasing the occurrence on the right side.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsually, DeduplicateRelations rule does exactly this. But the generic `QueryPlan.rewriteAttrs` replaces all occurrences of the duplicate reference with the new reference, but `CoGroup` uses the old reference for left and right group attributes, value attributes, and group order. Only the occurrences in the right attributes must be replaced.\r\n\r\nFurther, the right deserialization expression is not touched at all.\r\n\r\nThe following DataFrame cannot be evaluated:\r\n```scala\r\nval df = spark.range(3)\r\n\r\nval left_grouped_df = df.groupBy(\"id\").as[Long, Long]\r\nval right_grouped_df = df.groupBy(\"id\").as[Long, Long]\r\n\r\nval cogroup_df = left_grouped_df.cogroup(right_grouped_df) {\r\n  case (key, left, right) => left\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe query plan:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- SerializeFromObject [input[0, bigint, false] AS value#12L]\r\n   +- CoGroup, id#0: bigint, id#0: bigint, id#0: bigint, [id#13L], [id#13L], [id#13L], [id#13L], obj#11: bigint\r\n      :- !Sort [id#13L ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n      :  +- !Exchange hashpartitioning(id#13L, 200), ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [plan_id=16]\r\n      :     +- Range (0, 3, step=1, splits=16)\r\n      +- Sort [id#13L ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n         +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#13L, 200), ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [plan_id=17]\r\n            +- Range (0, 3, step=1, splits=16)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEvaluating this plan fails with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Couldn't find id#19L in [id#0L]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis fixes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBackport https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38376 to `branch-3.2`\r\n\r\nYou can find a detailed description of the issue and an example reproduction on the Jira card: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40817\r\n\r\nThe idea for this fix is to update the logic which uploads user-specified files (via `spark.jars`, `spark.files`, etc) to `spark.kubernetes.file.upload.path`. After uploading local files, it used to overwrite the initial list of URIs passed by the user and it would thus erase all remote URIs which were specified there.\r\n\r\nSmall example of this behaviour: \r\n1. User set the value of `spark.jars` to `s3a://some-bucket/my-application.jar,/tmp/some-local-jar.jar` when running `spark-submit` in cluster mode\r\n2. `BasicDriverFeatureStep.getAdditionalPodSystemProperties()` gets called at one point while running `spark-submit`\r\n3. This function would set `spark.jars` to a new value of `${SPARK_KUBERNETES_UPLOAD_PATH}/spark-upload-${RANDOM_STRING}/some-local-jar.jar`. Note that `s3a://some-bucket/my-application.jar` has been discarded.\r\n\r\nWith the logic proposed in this PR, the new value of `spark.jars` would be `s3a://some-bucket/my-application.jar,${SPARK_KUBERNETES_UPLOAD_PATH}/spark-upload-${RANDOM_STRING}/some-local-jar.jar`, so in other words we are making sure that remote URIs are no longer discarded.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe encountered this issue in production when trying to launch Spark on Kubernetes jobs in cluster mode with a fix of local and remote dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, see description of the new behaviour above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added a unit test for the new behaviour\r\n- Added an integration test for the new behaviour\r\n- Tried this patch in our Kubernetes environment with `SparkPi`:\r\n```\r\nspark-submit \\\r\n  --master k8s://https://$KUBERNETES_API_SERVER_URL:443 \\\r\n  --deploy-mode cluster \\\r\n  --name=spark-submit-test \\\r\n  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \\\r\n  --conf spark.jars=/opt/my-local-jar.jar,s3a://$BUCKET_NAME/my-remote-jar.jar \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.file.upload.path=s3a://$BUCKET_NAME/my-upload-path/ \\\r\n  [...]\r\n  /opt/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.12-3.1.3.jar\r\n```\r\nBefore applying the patch, `s3a://$BUCKET_NAME/my-remote-jar.jar` was discarded from the final value of `spark.jars`. After applying the patch and launching the job again, I confirmed that `s3a://$BUCKET_NAME/my-remote-jar.jar` was no longer discarded by looking at the Spark config for the running

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBackport https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38376 to `branch-3.3`\r\n\r\nYou can find a detailed description of the issue and an example reproduction on the Jira card: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40817\r\n\r\nThe idea for this fix is to update the logic which uploads user-specified files (via `spark.jars`, `spark.files`, etc) to `spark.kubernetes.file.upload.path`. After uploading local files, it used to overwrite the initial list of URIs passed by the user and it would thus erase all remote URIs which were specified there.\r\n\r\nSmall example of this behaviour: \r\n1. User set the value of `spark.jars` to `s3a://some-bucket/my-application.jar,/tmp/some-local-jar.jar` when running `spark-submit` in cluster mode\r\n2. `BasicDriverFeatureStep.getAdditionalPodSystemProperties()` gets called at one point while running `spark-submit`\r\n3. This function would set `spark.jars` to a new value of `${SPARK_KUBERNETES_UPLOAD_PATH}/spark-upload-${RANDOM_STRING}/some-local-jar.jar`. Note that `s3a://some-bucket/my-application.jar` has been discarded.\r\n\r\nWith the logic proposed in this PR, the new value of `spark.jars` would be `s3a://some-bucket/my-application.jar,${SPARK_KUBERNETES_UPLOAD_PATH}/spark-upload-${RANDOM_STRING}/some-local-jar.jar`, so in other words we are making sure that remote URIs are no longer discarded.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe encountered this issue in production when trying to launch Spark on Kubernetes jobs in cluster mode with a mix of local and remote dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, see description of the new behaviour above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added a unit test for the new behaviour\r\n- Added an integration test for the new behaviour\r\n- Tried this patch in our Kubernetes environment with `SparkPi`:\r\n```\r\nspark-submit \\\r\n  --master k8s://https://$KUBERNETES_API_SERVER_URL:443 \\\r\n  --deploy-mode cluster \\\r\n  --name=spark-submit-test \\\r\n  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \\\r\n  --conf spark.jars=/opt/my-local-jar.jar,s3a://$BUCKET_NAME/my-remote-jar.jar \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.file.upload.path=s3a://$BUCKET_NAME/my-upload-path/ \\\r\n  [...]\r\n  /opt/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.12-3.1.3.jar\r\n```\r\nBefore applying the patch, `s3a://$BUCKET_NAME/my-remote-jar.jar` was discarded from the final value of `spark.jars`. After applying the patch and launching the job again, I confirmed that `s3a://$BUCKET_NAME/my-remote-jar.jar` was no longer discarded by looking at the Spark config for the running

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, JDBCRDD uses fixed format for SELECT statement.\r\n```\r\nval sqlText = options.prepareQuery +\r\n      s\"SELECT $columnList FROM ${options.tableOrQuery} $myTableSampleClause\" +\r\n      s\" $myWhereClause $getGroupByClause $getOrderByClause $myLimitClause $myOffsetClause\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut some databases have different syntax. For example, MS SQL Server uses keyword TOP to describe LIMIT clause or Top N.\r\nThe LIMIT clause of MS SQL Server show below.\r\n```\r\nSELECT TOP(1) Model, Color, Price  \r\n      FROM dbo.Cars  \r\n      WHERE Color = 'blue'\r\n```\r\nThe Top N of MS SQL Server show below.\r\n```\r\nSELECT TOP(1) Model, Color, Price  \r\nFROM dbo.Cars  \r\nWHERE Color = 'blue'  \r\nORDER BY Price ASC\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR lets JDBC dialect could define their own syntax.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nExtract the function that construct the select statement for JDBC

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAfter revisiting https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39416 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39623, I propose:\r\n* checking nullability of all string fields to avoid NPE\r\n* using `optional string` for the protobuf definition of all string fields. If the deserialized result is None, then set the string field as null. \r\n\r\nTake `AccumulableInfo` as an example, it can be null on created: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/status/LiveEntity.scala#L744\r\nThe null value can make difference in the UI logic: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ui/jobs/StagePage.scala#L791\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the developer guide and introduces utility methods for serializing/deserializing string fields. It also handles null string values in AccumulableInfo and ProcessSummary for setting an example.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n* update developer guide for better handling of null string values\r\n* add utility methods for future development of string serialization/deserialization\r\n* Properly handles null string values in AccumulableInfo and ProcessSummary for setting an example\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds Limit pushdown support for MS SQL Server. Although SQL Server does not support LIMIT clause, it supports TOP (N) expression (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/top-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16) which works in a similar way.\r\n\r\nIt is a simple change that adds another method to the dialect API to handle TOP expression specifically for SQL Server (or other database that might support it in the future). However, TOP and LIMIT are mutually exclusive in this PR.\r\n\r\nTOP (N) also requires that a subquery is named, e.g. `select TOP (5) * from (select * from test) XYZ`, otherwise the query fails. Currently Spark injects `SPARK_GEN_SUBQ_` name, so it works fine.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nEnables Limit pushdown for MS SQL Server.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37941 that proposes to enable pushing down the limit through Python UDFs by disabling `PushProjectionThroughLimit` if it has Python UDF.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udf\r\n\r\nspark.range(10).write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"/tmp/abc\")\r\n\r\n@udf(returnType='string')\r\ndef my_udf(arg):\r\n    return arg\r\n\r\n\r\ndf = spark.read.parquet(\"/tmp/abc\")\r\ndf = df.limit(10).withColumn(\"prediction\", my_udf(df[\"id\"])).explain()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before**:\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nCollectLimit 10\r\n+- *(2) Project [id#3L, pythonUDF0#10 AS prediction#6]\r\n   +- BatchEvalPython [my_udf(id#3L)#5], [pythonUDF0#10]\r\n      +- *(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n         +- FileScan parquet [id#3L] Batched: true, DataFilters: [], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(1 paths)[file:/tmp/abc], PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<id:bigint>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**:\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan

InMemoryFileIndex(1 paths)[file:/tmp/abc], PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<id:bigint>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo restore the performance issue. This is a regression in the master branch.\r\n\r\nPython UDF is very slow, and it is executed asynchronously and process data in batch. So, regardless of the parent limit, Python UDF at least processes one batch (e.g., one Arrow batch) which can potentially cause performance regression especially in a workload like machine learning. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nRestore the performance.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-19T12:57:08Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:52:32Z","closed_at":"2023-02-01T09:23:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3b4e9a4da7398823a91f50705d8218520b0093b9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39653/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39653/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39653/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e53b571905032cadc94a00eb0b51101eace763ef","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-42115","ref":"SPARK-42115","sha":"e53b571905032cadc94a00eb0b51101eace763ef","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror
