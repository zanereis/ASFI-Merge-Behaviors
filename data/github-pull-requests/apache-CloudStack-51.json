For each network(for which VPN is supported and enabled), the VPN users are shared. As the Cloudstack doc says “ The account owner can create and manage users for their VPN. CloudStack does not use its account database for this purpose but uses a separate table. The VPN user database is shared across all the VPNs created by the account owner. All VPN users get access to all VPNs created by the account owner.”\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of going inside each network and adding VPN users give the first feel as if the users are network based.

'force' option provided with the stopVirtualMachine API command is\r\noften assumed to be a hard shutdown sent to the hypervisor, when in fact\r\nit is for CloudStacks' internal use. CloudStack should be able to send\r\nthe 'hard' power-off request to the hosts.\r\n    \r\nWhen forced parameter on the stopVM API is true, power off (hard shutdown)\r\na VM. This uses initial changes from #1635 to pass the forced parameter\r\nto hypervisor plugin via the StopCommand, and fixes force stop (poweroff)\r\nhandling for KVM, VMware and XenServer.\r\n\r\nThis will speed up VM stops with forced=true. Useful for CI-like environments.\r\nThe global setting `vm.destroy.forcestop` is now also honoured to force stop VMs while destroying them, if it is set to true.\r\n\r\nPinging for review

size.\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-12T09:03:37Z","updated_at":"2017-06-07T05:38:04Z","closed_at":"2017-06-07T05:38:04Z","merged_at":"2017-06-07T05:38:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"ccd623fdf55eebb108ea48558501bb0ff3b2e84f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843366,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:enhancement","name":"type:enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/2100/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/2100/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2100/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/721f4475f43f1ba439670b44f5489de0c0912f4f","head":{"label":null,"ref":"CLOUDSTACK-9907","sha":"721f4475f43f1ba439670b44f5489de0c0912f4f","user":null,"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"38701073a6995b0ccfa17a9c865571cca03661b6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

This timeout is configurable using a global configuration ‘job.cancel.threshold.minutes’ and it defaults to 1 hour. For large volumes, even though users configure other snapshot timeout values (‘vmware.snapshot.backup.session.timeout’ and ‘backup.snapshot.wait‘) to a very high value, the snapshot operation will still fail because the job will be cancelled in 1 hour. \r\n\r\n- A new configuration parameter 'volume.snapshot.job.cancel.threshold' has been introduced that will allow admins to separate out the

root volume can be replaced by a different root volume without the VM it belongs to being expunged.\r\n\r\nFrom dev@:\r\n\r\nFor example: Let’s say we have a system VM running on NFS primary storage. We then put this primary storage into maintenance mode, which creates the system VM (with the same name) on a different primary storage (we do not create a new row in the cloud.vm_instance table for this VM). While this VM works, the original root disk of the system VM remains on the original primary storage and is not destroyed by the code in StorageManagerImpl.cleanupStorage(boolean) in 4.10 because 4.10 (as shown above) only asks for non-root volumes to consider for deletion. In the 4.9 version of the code, the original root disk is cleaned up in StorageManagerImpl.cleanupStorage(boolean). The problem with 4.10 relying on a root disk always being deleted when the VM it belongs to is deleted is that in a situation like this that the system VM doesn’t get deleted at this point – it gets a new root disk that’s hosted by a different primary storage (so now it’s original root disk is stranded).\r\n\r\n*** Update on May 19, 2017 ***\r\n\r\nI recently discovered a new use case (in addition to the one above) that this PR fixes:\r\n\r\nReinstall VM\r\n\r\nWhen you run a \"Reinstall VM\", the root disk is removed from the VM and a new one is given to the VM. The old root disk later gets cleaned up by the storage cleanup thread.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-9917","created_at":"2017-05-11T19:48:12Z","updated_at":"2017-05-24T18:44:40Z","closed_at":"2017-05-24T10:11:59Z","merged_at":"2017-05-24T10:11:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"0b989236796b33e7d4fd21a0056d66c6655b72ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843364,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:bug","name":"type:bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":""},{"id":592316044,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTIzMTYwNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/status:CI-running","name":"status:CI-running","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":592953226,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTI5NTMyMjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Severity:BLOCKER","name":"Severity:BLOCKER","color":"b60205","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/2/labels","id":2457914,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMjQ1NzkxNA==","number":2,"title":"4.10.0.0","description":"4.10.0.0

root volume can be replaced by a different root volume without the VM it belongs to being expunged.\r\n\r\nFrom dev@:\r\n\r\nFor example: Let’s say we have a system VM running on NFS primary storage. We then put this primary storage into maintenance mode, which creates the system VM (with the same name) on a different primary storage (we do not create a new row in the cloud.vm_instance table for this VM). While this VM works, the original root disk of the system VM remains on the original primary storage and is not destroyed by the code in StorageManagerImpl.cleanupStorage(boolean) in 4.10 because 4.10 (as shown above) only asks for non-root volumes to consider for deletion. In the 4.9 version of the code, the original root disk is cleaned up in StorageManagerImpl.cleanupStorage(boolean). The problem with 4.10 relying on a root disk always being deleted when the VM it belongs to is deleted is that in a situation like this that the system VM doesn’t get deleted at this point – it gets a new root disk that’s hosted by a different primary storage (so now it’s original root disk is

However the state transition happening on this derived entity is not observable in UI(Browser). Since this transition has no specific usage across the product, truncated the transition. \r\n\r\nThere after parallel volume(s) creation is supported in ACS.

have removed unnecessary VPN disconnects when updating the VPN configuration (or any configuration which changes public IP addresses).  I have verified the functionality still behaves as expected with these changes to the Remote Access VPN config.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have also added a fix to the S2S VPN to not make it drop the VPN connection when other networking config is changed.  I was not able to reproduce the problem described in https://github.com/MissionCriticalCloud/cosmic/pull/339 manually, but we have experienced similar issues in our production environment which makes me think this is a worthwhile change.  I have tested that the functionality still behaves as expected with this change, so I have added it to this PR as

sequential processed and it has to generate usage from the date of last unprocessed event.\r\n\r\nIn case of exception, exception is suppressed in the current implementation and usage server process rest of the events.\r\nwhen usage server starts again it picks the unprocessed event (due to exception) and reports the usage from unprocessed event date.\r\n\r\nTo avoid duplication usage, server should stop processing the events  when there is an exception.\r\nFor the same exceptions are not suppressed as part of the fix.\r\n\r\nIn the code for only EVENT_VM_START, EVENT_VM_CREATE  events have try catch blocks rest of the events don't have, so removing try catch blocks\r\n\r\nBusiness justification : In correct usage or incomplete usage results in discrepancies in billing, payment . also impacts customer relationships, fixing all dependent systems is time consuming and complicated so better to handle this in cloudstack and let admin fix the wrong event and then generate the

- Consecutive VM cold migration fails.\r\n**Root Cause Analysis** - In case of VMware, if VM is being cold migrated between clusters belonging to two different VMware DCs, Cloudstack unregisters the VM from the source host and cleans up the associated VM files. The check if a VM is being cold migrated across DCs is made using the source host id. In case of consecutive cold migrations since the source host id of a VM is NULL and no VM exists, Cloudstack should skip the check\r\n**Proposed Solution** - Attempt to unregister a VM in another DC,

present, The management IP range can only be expanded under the same subnet. According to existing range, either the last IP can be forward extended or the first IP can be backward extended. But we cannot add an entirely different range from the same subnet. So the expansion of range is subnet bound, which is fixed. But when the range gets exhausted and a user wants to deploy more system VMs, then the operation would fail. The purpose of this feature is to expand the range of management network IPs within the existing subnet. It can also delete and list the IP ranges.\r\n\r\nPlease refer the FS here:

a VM is deployed with in an Affinity group which has the cluster dedicated to a subdomain (zone is dedicated to parent domain) it is getting successful. We can also stop the vm and remove the affinity group, but if you want to add back the affinity it is failing.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. I had created a Domain (Glass SA Parent Domain) and under it a subdomain (Glass SA Subdomain) and created an account to it.\r\n2. Apply dedication to the zone for primary domain (Glass SA Parent Domain)\r\n3. Apply dedication to the cluster for sub domain (Glass SA Subdomain)\r\n4. Logged in with the Account of Subdomain.\r\n5. Created an instance with the affinity (DedicatedGrp-domain-Glass SA Subdomain) - the dedication set with the cluster for the subdomain.\r\n6. Powered off the VM, removed the affinity.\r\n7. Tried adding back (the cluster affinity subdomain) - gives the error \"Entity affinity Group () and entity Acct () belong to different accounts\" \r\n\r\nRoot cause:\r\nDuring VM deployment there is clear check on affinity type (account/domain). Here since the acl_type is \"domain\" it does not expect to be same owner for entities.\r\nBut during update of affinity to VM there is no specific check for acl_type \"domain\".\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nFix is to make the access check similar to VM deployment where it does not expect to be same owner for entities if the acl_type is

checkbatchs2svpn.sh VR script returns (\"via echo\") that status of each requested S2S VPN check one-at-a-time.  If there is even a slight delay between VPN checks, the sshExecutor stops monitoring stdout and assumes it has all of the output.\r\n\r\nWhen checking the management server logs, we see a request to check _X_ number of VPNs, but the response is occasionally less than _X_ number... The rest of the Cloudstack code assumes \"isConnected\" as false if the VPN is not included in the response.\r\n\r\nWe've noticed that if an account had more than 3 site-to-site VPNs, that there are many errors per day stating that a S2S VPN is down.\r\n\r\nThis is exacerbated by Issue CLOUDSTACK-9873, because that issues causes the S2S VPN check (and many others) to run twice as often as intended.\r\n\r\nI set this PR to 4.7, but it affects all new versions also.  We are running 4.9.2.0.\r\n\r\nExample where a request was to check 4x S2S VPN connections, but only 3x responses were returned.\r\n```\r\n2017-04-11 17:05:40,444 DEBUG [c.c.h.x.r.CitrixResourceBase]
