[com.mchange:c3p0](https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0) from 0.9.5.5 to 0.10.0-pre1.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0/blob/v0.10.0-pre1/CHANGELOG\">com.mchange:c3p0's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>c3p0-0.10.0-pre1\n-- Fix doc comments no longer acceptable under persnicketty JDK 11\n-- Build with JDK 11 JVM (still emitting JDK 1.6 compatible sources)\n-- Get tests working under new mill build\n-- Reorganize to switch build from ant to mill\n-- Update to mchange-commons-java 0.2.20\nc3p0-0.9.5.5\n-- Update docs to describe new com.mchange.v2.log.MLog.useRedirectableLoggers setting, implemented\nin mchange-commons-java 0.2.19\n-- Update to mchange-commons-java 0.2.19\n-- Properly implement the JDBC 4.1 abort method. Thanks to Andrew Johnson for calling attention\nto this issue.\nc3p0-0.9.5.4\n-- Disabling entity expansions, as we did in v.0.9.5.3 turns out not to be sufficient to prevent all\nXML-config parsing related attacks (if an attacker can control the XML config file that will be\nparsed). We now make XML parsing much more restrictove by default, but allow users to revert to the\nold, permissive pre-0.9.5.3 behavior by setting config property 'com.mchange.v2.c3p0.cfg.xml.usePermissiveParser'\nto true. That property replaces and leaves deprecated the 'com.mchange.v2.c3p0.cfg.xml.expandEntityReferences'\nproperty introduced on 0.9.5.3. Many thanks to Aaron Massey (amassey) at HackerOne for calling attention\nto the continued vulnerability of XML parsing to these kinds of attacks.\n-- Address situation where a throwable during forceKillAcquires() left the force_kill_acquires flag\nset to true, making it impossible for the pool to restart acquisition attempts on recovery. We\nnow unset the flag under any circumstance, but log interrupts or unexpected throwables, and make\na best effort to complete the intended expiration of waiting clients by throwing InterruptException\nMany thanks to Stefan Cordes (rscadrde on github), Vipin Nair (swvist on github), and Łukasz Jąder\n(ljader on github) for their work on this issue.\nc3p0-0.9.5.3\n-- Address CVE-2018-20433, <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20433\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20433</a> re liberal parsing of\nXML config. By default, c3p0 no longer expands entity references in XML config files. This\nbehavior can be overridden via config property 'com.mchange.v2.c3p0.cfg.xml.expandEntityReferences'\nby applications that understand the security concerns but wish to make use of entity references.\nThanks to user zhutougg on GitHub for calling attention to and suggesting a fix for this issue.\n-- Upgrade dependency to mchange-commons-java 0.2.15, which includes support for log4j2 (implemented\nin mchange-commons-java by GitHub user fireandfuel. Many thanks!</p>\n<p>c3p0-0.9.5.2\n-- Fix a bug in MLog bridge to slf4j logging, in which loggability of levels of wrapped loggers\nwas misreported, leading to useless allocation of log Strings below the logging threshold. Grr.\n[change is in mchange-commons-java 0.2.11]. Many thanks to Lewis Wong on Stack Exchange for calling\nattention to this issue.\n-- Embed last acquistion failure as nested Exception in CannotAcquireResourceException. Thanks to\nnigam on github for this addition.\nc3p0-0.9.5.1\n-- Implemented configuration property com.mchange.v2.c3p0.impl.DefaultConnectionTester.isValidTimeout\nto define timeouts on tests based on Connection.isValid(...). Many thanks to james-hu on github\nfor suggesting this.\n-- Added a forceSynchronousCheckins config param, which can be a significant performance boost\nif no tests are performed on checkin and no long work is performed in ConnectionCustomizer.onCheckIn(...).\nThe parameter is particularly useful for installations in which the Thread pool is under stress,\nas it permits prompt checkins without use of the Thread pool, and helps reduce Thread pool congestion.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2070\">2070</a></li>\n<li><strong>Wildcard attribute selector</strong>: Added support for the <code>[*]</code> element with any attribute selector.

The fix includes a EvaluatorDebug class\nthat generates a sexpr to represent the query, allowing simpler and more thorough query parse\ntests. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2073\">2073</a></li>\n<li><strong>XML CData output</strong>: When generating XML-syntax output from parsed HTML, script nodes containing (pseudo) CData\nsections would have an extraneous CData section added, causing script execution errors. Now, the data content is\nemitted in a HTML/XML/XHTML polyglot format, if the data is not already within a CData\nsection. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2078\">2078</a></li>\n<li><strong>Thread safety</strong>: The <code>:has</code> evaluator held a non-thread-safe Iterator, and so if an Evaluator object was\nshared across multiple concurrent threads, a NoSuchElement exception may be thrown, and the selected results may be\nincorrect.

Now, the iterator object is a thread-local. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2088\">2088</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Older changes for versions 0.1.1 (2010-Jan-31) through 1.17.1 (2023-Nov-27) may be found in\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/change-archive.txt\">change-archive.txt</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/9dec1baba5b3d0fa11268c95630b391f9de664ad\"><code>9dec1ba</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release jsoup-1.17.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/d3a572423233ff6ce4ff2892e60e4c80febc7b9c\"><code>d3a5724</code></a> Changelog for 1.17.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/1963a7c17fc8b95ec6f6d150d716c9d9c4065c2e\"><code>1963a7c</code></a> Bump org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin from 3.12.0 to 3.12.1 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2\">#2</a>...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/d4b2c36dadad3e644d1c1b5b85aa704b22c3b077\"><code>d4b2c36</code></a> Simplify node filtering operations using Streams API (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2080\">#2080</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/78be89abde691c066fd55a1ca24254447e21cfe6\"><code>78be89a</code></a> Move iter into Has class</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/374ded2bc3d57108fffbead844371ecc5fab63ee\"><code>374ded2</code></a> Use a threadlocal to hold the NodeIterator</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/4fb1036ce7892fa1f938cee4f37435e85dd30797\"><code>4fb1036</code></a> Bump org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin from 3.2.2 to 3.2.3 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2086\">#2086</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/c9ce65a9fec3cf6ddeb2dbe5d98214b6a03698b4\"><code>c9ce65a</code></a> Bump org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-failsafe-plugin from 3.2.2 to 3.2.3 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2085\">#2085</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/20c9162234e55a297cd1a2195af70d9353ab3e05\"><code>20c9162</code></a> Bump org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin from 3.11.0 to 3.12.0 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2\">#2</a>...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/d5bc100eab6238b4b682a45fc04e829ff46459ef\"><code>d5bc100</code></a> Corrected namespace tests</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/compare/jsoup-1.17.1...jsoup-1.17.2\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=org.jsoup:jsoup&package-manager=maven&previous-version=1.17.1&new-version=1.17.2)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

I spotted that public signup to Tika Jira is disabled, so I'm not sure what is the correct flow for issues without a ticket, putting all related info here...\r\n\r\n### Issue description\r\n`org.apache.tika.parser.html.JSoupParser` parser ignores `body` content after the `script` tag. Check `org.apache.tika.parser.html.HtmlParserTest#testScriptInBody` test for details.\r\n\r\n### Fix description\r\nThe main reason of such behaviour is that `#data` tag tail decrements `org.apache.tika.parser.html.HtmlHandler.bodyLevel`, when `#data` tag head is considered a content node and doesn't invoke `startElement` logic at all. As a fix I mirrored head logic for the data node to the tail and returned `FilterResult.CONTINUE` early.\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-26T12:42:51Z","updated_at":"2024-01-02T14:22:20Z","closed_at":"2024-01-02T14:22:03Z","merged_at":"2024-01-02T14:22:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"8ac572352a5f9dff5fb654b696231c9b7656b6ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/1522/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/1522/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/1522/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/statuses/18739d7fc2b3eec3597c9914e2a9b1e1b8fb54a1","head":{"label":"yakivy:html-parser-script-in-body","ref":"html-parser-script-in-body","sha":"18739d7fc2b3eec3597c9914e2a9b1e1b8fb54a1","user":{"login":"yakivy","id":39760199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzYwMTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39760199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy","html_url":"https://github.com/yakivy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":735903155,"node_id":"R_kgDOK9z9sw","name":"tika","full_name":"yakivy/tika","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yakivy","id":39760199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzYwMTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39760199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy","html_url":"https://github.com/yakivy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakivy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yakivy/tika","description":"The
