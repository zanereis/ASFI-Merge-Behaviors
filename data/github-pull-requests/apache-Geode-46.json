InternalDistributedSystem.Builder.\r\n\r\nSeveral tests are using  InternalDistributedSystem.BuilderForTesting.\r\n\r\nNOTES FOR REVIEWERS (PLEASE READ):\r\n\r\nNOTE: this is NOT the final refactoring/change to InternalDistributedSystem involving the Builder. We need to make some changes to reconnect for Micrometer. We will also be injecting a Micrometer MeterRegistry into InternalDistributedSystem. And finally, I think we'll be looking into making connectInternal private and changing internal code paths to use the Builder instead of connectInternal. Then there would be two code paths to create a InternalDistributedSystem: \r\n1) DistributedSystem.connect which would delegate to InternalDistributedSystem.Builder\r\n2) InternalDistributedSystem.Builder which would be used from internal code paths such as InternalCacheBuilder and reconnect\r\n\r\nALSO: I'd love to delete BuilderForTesting and replace it with mocking in every test where that's possible.\r\n\r\nPlease review: @demery-pivotal @mhansonp

Fix Constraints Check in Alter Region\r\n\r\nSome persistence constraints were not correctly validated for a\r\npartitioned region before associating an async-event-queue and/or\r\ngateway-sender, leaving the region and the cluster configuration\r\nservice inconsistent.\r\n\r\n- Fixed minor warnings.\r\n- Fixed the internal validation implemented by PartitionedRegion.\r\n- Some method's signatures were changed from \"parallelGatewaySender\" to\r\n\"parallelAsynchronousEventDispatcher\" as they are used alike for\r\nboth a gateway-sender and async-event-queue.\r\n\r\nThank you for

work solves two problems.  One is that the query cancellation task\r\nreference in DefaultQuery could be overwritten and thus never removed\r\nfrom monitoring upon successful completion of a query.  Second is that\r\nonce a query execution timed out once, the query object was in an\r\nunusable state which is undesirable.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to attach the cancellation state to the execution\r\ncontext rather than the query object, so that cancellation is associated\r\nwith each independent execution of a query rather than having\r\ncancellation state that applies to the entire query object.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `develop`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does `gradlew build` run cleanly?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and\r\nsubmit an update to your PR as soon as possible. If you need help, please send an\r\nemail to dev@geode.apache.org.\r\n\r\n@dschneider-pivotal would you be able to review this? We are worried this might constitute a breaking change for geode users.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-14T23:51:03Z","updated_at":"2019-04-03T23:43:26Z","closed_at":"2019-04-03T23:43:19Z","merged_at":"2019-04-03T23:43:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"e4bcc25b791fec51b579f705d165567ec1dda9a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/3308/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/3308/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3308/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/1badacf50fa825339580c08a332d76c0b14ba054","head":{"label":"BenjaminPerryRoss:feature/GEODE-6527","ref":"feature/GEODE-6527","sha":"1badacf50fa825339580c08a332d76c0b14ba054","user":{"login":"BenjaminPerryRoss","id":39068135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDY4MTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39068135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss","html_url":"https://github.com/BenjaminPerryRoss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142193757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDIxOTM3NTc=","name":"geode","full_name":"BenjaminPerryRoss/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BenjaminPerryRoss","id":39068135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDY4MTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39068135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss","html_url":"https://github.com/BenjaminPerryRoss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BenjaminPerryRoss/geode","description":"Apache
