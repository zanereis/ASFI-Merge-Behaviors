patch contains changes to the handling of the INVALID_PRODUCER_ID_MAPPING error.\r\n**Quoted from KIP-890**\r\nSince we bump epoch on abort, we no longer need to call InitProducerId to fence requests. InitProducerId will only be called when the producer starts up to fence a previous instance. \r\n\r\nWith this change, some other calls to InitProducerId were inspected including the call after receiving an InvalidPidMappingException. This exception was changed to abortable as part of [KIP-360: Improve reliability of idempotent/transactional producer](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=89068820). However, this change means that we can violate EOS guarantees. As an example:\r\n\r\nConsider an application that is copying data from one partition to another\r\n\r\nApplication instance A processes to offset 4\r\nApplication instance B comes up and fences application instance A\r\nApplication instance B processes to offset 5\r\nApplication instances A and B are idle for transaction.id.expiration.ms, transaction id expires on server\r\nApplication instance A attempts to process offset 5 (since in its view, that is next) -- if we recover from invalid pid mapping, we can duplicate this processing\r\nThus, INVALID_PID_MAPPING should be fatal to the producer. \r\n\r\nThis is consistent with [KIP-1050: Consistent error handling for Transactions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-1050%3A+Consistent+error+handling+for+Transactions) where errors that are fatal to the producer are in the \"application recoverable\" category. This is a grouping that indicates to the client that the producer needs to restart and recovery on the application side is necessary. KIP-1050 is approved so we are consistent with that decision.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-14T23:17:39Z","updated_at":"2024-11-18T02:43:05Z","closed_at":"2024-11-18T02:43:05Z","merged_at":"2024-11-18T02:43:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"e4c00346793f93bf358acbf85da4bc18c916eb2a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

testing dynamic quorums, I ran into a few issues that might be mitigated by improved docs, specifically around the semantics of dynamic quorums. This adds a small summary to the new features, where this is added.\r\n\r\nThe biggest thing I ran into is that 3.8 and below disallowed controller listeners being included in `advertised.listeners`, and 3.9 allows controller listeners in the `advertised.listeners`. Not only that, advertised listeners are effectively *required* to communicate with dynamically-added controllers.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design

Part 1: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17641\r\nIntroduces v2 of vote RPC and includes handling of PreVote requests. Includes KafkaRaftClientPreVoteTest.\r\n\r\nSome behaviors to note:\r\n- Many references to `candidate` are changed to more generic `replica`. In the next PreVote PR we will be adding Prospective state and it will not be guaranteed that `candidates` are sending vote requests.\r\n- Replicas receiving PreVote requests (vote request with prevote=true) with an epoch equal to their own will _not_ transition to Unattached state. They will only grant the vote if they do not know of the leader/have not fetched from them yet in the epoch and the request's last epoch and offset are up-to-date with theirs.\r\n- If a replica receives a PreVote request with an epoch greater than their current epoch, they will transition to Unattached state (setting their epoch to one from the prevote request) and then grant the vote if the above conditions are met.\r\n- Vote requests with prevote=false are handled the same way as before.\r\n- Included in this PR are changes to Follower state's `canGrantVote`. This addresses a ping-pong scenario brought up by Jack Vanlightly. (ex: 3 node quorum, leader node A disconnects from quorum, node B goes into prospective state first before node C, node B sends prevote request to node C still in follower state and receives back that node A is leader, node B transitions to follower while node C transitions to prospective after election timeout, repeating this cycle). We tackle this by having follower state nodes grant prevote requests based off last fetch time. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

PR adds listeners to Partition class which might invoke the clean up of share partitions on Partition changes.\r\n\r\nI considered introducing new Listener class which defines methods per SharePartitionKey but avoided as that would have required wiring up at the calls at different places in ReplicaManager. Additionally replica manager needed handling to store the new listener, etc. I found the current PR approach better as SharePartition is abstracted Shared view of Partition hence attaching the change events on Partition is helpful.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

stream thread needs to integrate with the Streams membership manager to receive an assignment. This happens through callbacks that are set in the streams assignment interface. The Streams membership manager calls three callbacks:\r\n- onTasksRevoked that revokes tasks assigned to the stream thread\r\n- onTaskAssigned that assigns tasks to the stream thread \r\n- onAllTasksLost that releases all tasks of a stream thread and closes them dirty.\r\n\r\nInitially, we thought we could avoid onTasksRevoked by just considering revoked tasks in onTaskAssigned. However, it turns out we cannot avoid onTasksRevoked because if we do that we would need to set the new assignment in the subscription state before or after the call to onTaskAssigned. If we set the new assignment in the subscription state before we call onTaskAssigned, commits of the revoked tasks will fail because the subscription state would not contain the partitions of the revoked tasks anymore. If we set the new assignment in the subscription state after we call onTaskAssigned, we cannot safely pause the partitions of the assigned task for restoration because we do not know when the new assignment is actually set in the subscription state since that happens on the background thread. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

are some of my conclusions about this flaky test.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the reason for the failure of this test is due to TIMEOUT, the method `AbstractConsumerTest#validateGroupAssignment` timeout after waiting for 10 seconds. And it reproduced on my computer.\r\n\r\n`AbstractConsumerTest#validateGroupAssignment` is used to check all the consumer's assignments meet expectations, the exception as below:  \r\n\r\n```\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: Did not get valid assignment for partitions HashSet(topic1-2, topic1-4, topic-1, topic-0, topic1-5, topic1-1, topic1-0, topic1-3). Instead, got ArrayBuffer(Set(topic1-1, topic1-0, topic1-2), Set(topic1-5, topic1-4), Set())\r\n```\r\n\r\nI ran this junit test many times on my local computer after I added some logs. Then I found the timeout case is the GroupProtocol.CONSUMER mode. The CONSUMER mode maybe interact with the GroupCoordinator multiple times before reconciliation completed\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7b901cb-f915-41d5-8250-4a2b997a4596)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe frequency of interaction is controlled by configuration `group.consumer.heartbeat.interval.ms` which default value is 5000ms. Those successful unit tests take at least 5 seconds to complete, so maybe we can reduce heartbeat interval.\r\n\r\nAfter I set `group.consumer.heartbeat.interval.ms` to 1000ms, this problem has not occurred again on my computer. And running this unit test has become more faster.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3212128-99ea-4dee-b982-97c379d9fd81)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-13T04:39:47Z","updated_at":"2024-11-15T18:39:17Z","closed_at":"2024-11-15T18:39:17Z","merged_at":"2024-11-15T18:39:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"283d56cf569d0071bac146a06dc81ca33077dab4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

we introduced \"startup tasks\" in #16922, we initialized them with\nno input partitions, because they aren't known until assignment.\n\nHowever, when we update them during assignment, it's possible that we\nupdate the topology with the incorrect source topics for some internal\ntopics, due to a difference in the way internal topics are handled for\nStandbyTasks.\n\nTo resolve this, we now initialize startup tasks with the correct input\npartitions, by calculating them from the Topology.\n\nWhen we assign our startup tasks, we now conditionally update their\ninput partitions only if they've actually changed, just as we do for\nregular StandbyTasks.\n\nWith this, the E2E tests now pass, as

a consumer receives group heartbeat with revoked partitions. If the consumer enable auto commit, it will send a OffsetCommitRequest before removing revoked partitions from subscription state. There are two potential race conditions in AsyncKafkaConsumer:\r\n\r\n* If there is data in FetchBuffer from previous FetchRequest, users can still get data from `poll` function. However, the auto commit function doesn't work for these data, because the consumer mark revoked partitions with `pendingRevocation=true` after we receives OffsetCommitResponse. At that time, there is no further OffsetCommitRequest will be sent by auto commit feature.\r\n* The FetchRequestManager still can send new FetchRequest before the consumer receives OffsetCommitResponse. The reason is same as above.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we have to mark `pendingRevocation=true` before the consumer sends last OffsetCommitRequest, so FetchCollector can't get revoked partition data from FetchBuffer and FetchRequestManager doesn't send new FetchReqeust with revoked partitions.\r\n\r\nI run `consumer_test.py.test_broker_failure` 10 times without error.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>

* Currently, we are fetching results from futures using `future.get()` calls in `DefaultStatePersisterTest`. This may cause subtle issues resulting in hanging tests.\r\n* In this PR, the issue is resolved by replacing `get()` calls with `get(timeout)`.\r\n* Also, in the  `DefaultStatePersister` class, calls to `future.get` were replaced with `future.join` since in the concerned code, the futures are already completed when this call is made as the futures are combined using `allOf` and then passed to `thenApply`.\r\n* Few new tests have been added to `DefaultStatePersisterTest` to test various cases of extracting results from the futures - taking care of exceptional cases.","created_at":"2024-11-12T08:48:26Z","updated_at":"2024-11-13T00:17:40Z","closed_at":"2024-11-13T00:15:39Z","merged_at":"2024-11-13T00:15:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"adf4b6eb390249e6adf5976a491e5d117f0c87d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6979675393,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABoAVlAQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-932","name":"KIP-932","color":"DA462F","default":false,"description":"Queues

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, KTable foreign key joins only allow extracting the foreign key from the value of the source record. This forces users to duplicate data that might already exist in the key into the value when the foreign key needs to be derived from both the key and value. This leads to:\r\n- Data duplication\r\n- Additional storage overhead\r\n- Potential data inconsistency if the duplicated data gets out of sync\r\n- Less intuitive API when the foreign key is naturally derived from both key and value\r\n\r\nThis PR would allow user to extract the foreign key from the key and value of the source record.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x]
