few bugs was created from the previous issues. These are:\r\n1. During testing or some edge cases, the coordinator request manager might hold on to an inflight request forever. Therefore, when invoking coordinatorRequestManager.poll(), nothing would return.  Here we explicitly create a FindCoordinatorRequest regardless of the current request state because we want to actively search for a coordinator\r\n2. ensureCoordinatorReady() might be stuck in an infinite loop forever if the client fail to do so.  Even the consumer would be able to shutdown eventually, this is undesirable.\r\n3. The current asyncConsumerTest mixes background/network thread shutdown with the consumer shutdown.  As the goal of the module is unit testing, we should try to test the shutdown procedure separately.  Therefore, this PR adds a Mockito.doAnswer call to the applicationEventHandler.close().  Tests that are testing shutdown are calling shutdown()

up each value instead of overwriting.\r\n\r\nTo test this behavior, this PR also added a test that sends a ProduceRequest containing multiple partitions and calls `updateRecordConversionStats` through `processingStatsCallback`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

the new consumer, `Consumer.poll(Duration timeout)` blocks for the entire duration. If the consumer is joining a group and has not yet received its assignments, the poll begins before an assignment has yet been received. Because the poll is blocked, it does not notice when partitions are assigned, and it subsequently does not return any records. The old consumer only blocks for the duration of the heartbeat interval and loops for until the poll timeout has passed, and is thus able to check for assignments received.\r\n\r\nWhen this problem has been fixed, there remains another which prevents the group becoming stable. Because the consumer repeatedly sends the list of topic-partitions that it has been assigned to the group coordinator, the coordinator responds with the list of topic-partitions, which causes the consumer to remain reconciling indefinitely. By making the building of `ConsumerGroupHeartbeatRequest` stateful, the loop is ended and the group becomes stable as expected.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

aggregator object for a topic. The aggregator object in this pull request is `BrokerTopicAggregatedMetric`. Since the RemoteCopyLagBytes is a gauge I have introduced a new `GaugeWrapper`. The GaugeWrapper is used by the metrics collection system to interact with the BrokerTopicAggregatedMetric. The RemoteLogManager interacts with the BrokerTopicAggregatedMetric directly.","created_at":"2023-11-23T16:52:18Z","updated_at":"2025-02-03T13:27:29Z","closed_at":"2023-12-14T01:21:37Z","merged_at":"2023-12-14T01:21:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"a87e86e015f61de9a66012fd542dbf0417eb0387","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5624487963,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTz7gGw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tiered-storage","name":"tiered-storage","color":"B8FE9B","default":false,"description":"Related

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15888\r\n- By default, if there is no `client.id` configured on a Connect worker running in distributed mode, the same client ID (`connect-1`) will be used in the log context for the `DistributedHerder` class in every single worker in the Connect cluster.\r\n- This default is quite confusing and obviously not very useful.\r\n- Further, based on how this default is configured - https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/150b0e8290cda57df668ba89f6b422719866de5a/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/distributed/DistributedHerder.java#L299\r\nit seems like this might have been an unintentional bug (the static `AtomicInteger` is incremented in the `DistributedHerder`'s constructor, but we're only going to initialize a single `DistributedHerder` per worker JVM process).\r\n- This patch changes the default to simply use the `workerId` (the advertised host name and port of the worker) instead, which should be unique for each worker in a cluster.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

Overview\r\n* This change pertains to [SASL/OAUTHBEARER ](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_sasl_oauthbearer)  mechanism of Kafka authentication. \r\n* Kafka clients can use [SASL/OAUTHBEARER ](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_sasl_oauthbearer)   mechanism by overriding the [custom call back handlers](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_sasl_oauthbearer_prod) . \r\n* [KIP-768](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=186877575) available from v3.1  further extends the mechanism with a production grade implementation. \r\n* Kafka's [SASL/OAUTHBEARER ](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_sasl_oauthbearer)  mechanism currently **rejects the non-JWT (i.e. opaque) tokens**. This is because of a more restrictive set of characters than what [RFC-6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-2.1) recommends. \r\n* This JIRA can be considered an extension of [KIP-768](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=186877575) to support the opaque tokens as well apart from the JWT tokens.\r\n \r\n# Solution\r\n* Have updated the regex in the the offending class to be compliant with the [RFC-6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-2.1)\r\n* Have provided a supporting test case that includes the possible character set defined in

When re-resolving DNS after disconnecting, it is possible (likely, even) that we will resolve the same set of addresses in the same order, meaning we could attempt to reconnect to the same IP that we just disconnected from. In the case where we disconnected from the IP address because it has become unhealthy (due to a load balancer going down or a network routing layer restarting, for example), the client will need to time out before connecting to the next IP.

truncates stdout/stderr from tests which exceed 100,000 bytes. This truncation is computed once per-suite, meaning that each suite gets a 100kb budget for logs, and suites that log too much have the middle of the log truncated. This unfairly discards complete logs for tests in the middle of the suite, while keeping logs from the beginning and end of the suite.\r\n\r\nIf a failure occurs in a single test in the middle of a suite, the relevant logs may be completely elided, making investigation of the failure more difficult. This has made debugging with the CI logging almost completely ineffective, as the relevant logs are often swallowed by Jenkins, and irrelevant logs are shown.\r\n\r\nInstead, we can enable this feature in the Gradle JunitXmlReport: https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/org/gradle/api/tasks/testing/JUnitXmlReport.html#setOutputPerTestCase-boolean-\r\nThis changes the way that stdout/stderr is embedded in the XML report, separating the output for each test into different xml tags. This enables Jenkins to perform truncation on a per-test basis, so that each test in a suite gets a fair distribution of the logging budget.\r\n\r\nThis will reduce the total stored logs for small numbers of failures, and increases the amount of stored logs in situations with an excessive number of failures.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design

state updater waits on a condition variable if no tasks exist that need to be updated. The condition variable is wrapped by a loop to account for spurious wake-ups. The check whether updating tasks exist is done in the condition of the loop. Actually, the state updater thread can change whether updating tasks exists, but since the state updater thread is waiting for the condition variable the check for the existence of updating tasks will always return the same value as long as the state updater thread is waiting. Thus, the check only need to be done once before entering the loop.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves check before the loop making also the usage of mocks more robust since the processing becomes more deterministic.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

are currently many tests which instantiate sockets and channels, but don't close them. The vast majority of these sockets and channels are created via Selector and SocketServer, and are associated with clients and servers which are not closed properly. Many of these leaks are silent, and have gone unnoticed for years.\r\n\r\nTo allow us to detect these leaks and prevent future ones, we should have a Junit5 Extension which can detect when tests leak clients, and fail those tests with a diagnostic message.\r\n\r\nImplementation note: I tried to keep the `main` changes as small as possible, making use of the javax.net Factory classes to create a layer of indirection in the NetworkContext. This is a much less invasive change than dependency-injecting the factories and possibly having to add more constructors to the Kafka clients.\r\n\r\nWhile trying this out, I applied it automatically to all test suites with Jupiter's automatic registration mechanism. I added opt-out IgnoreAll and IgnoreEach annotations. I found that many test suites create a single Kafka cluster for the whole test, and this would cause the Each extension to generate false positives. This lead me to believe that Each should be opt-in instead, and a developer can add it temporarily with `@ExtendWith(LeakTestingExtension.Each.class)`.\r\n\r\nHowever, using automatic registration also means that consumers of the `clients` test-jar may unintentionally turn on this leak testing. We could avoid this by moving the extension to a different test-utils jar that is only for internal-use, or by disabling automatic registration and making this extension opt-in only.\r\n\r\nThis PR will cause many test failures for tests that are not compliant, and should not be merged as-is.

surrounding code.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

`group.id` configuration should no longer allow string values that—when trimmed of any whitespace—are zero length. By virtue of the existing `AbstractConfig` logic, string values are trimmed of whitespace on use.\r\n\r\nPrior to this change, the constructors of both `LegacyKafkaConsumer` and `AsyncKafkaConsumer` checked the value, and if it was empty, would log a warning. The new `AsyncKafkaConsumer` will enforce this by throwing an `InvalidGroupIdException` if the value is empty instead of logging.\r\n\r\nThere is no attempt to prevent the creation of a `ConsumerConfig` that contains an invalid `group.id` value. It is only checked and enforced on use when creating a `Consumer` instance.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

tests contain typos that leak sockets, mostly through clients that are left open.\r\n\r\nThe WorkerTest had rather involved resource leaks, which arose because the typical lifetime of the WorkerTask was partially or totally mocked. The WorkerTask subclass constructors accept clients as arguments, and take ownership of those clients, and the partial mocking prevented those clients from being closed appropriately.\r\n\r\nNow, all of (WorkerSourceTask, ExactlyOnceWorkerSourceTask, WorkerSinkTask) have their constructors mocked, and those constructors close the passed-in resources immediately. This also allows the test to avoid waiting for some cancellation timeouts to expire, making the test faster to run.\r\n\r\nThe other systematic typo that was present was the OffsetStore not being configured or closed, which caused a consumer to be leaked. This is because the constructor is instantiated in the factory method (e.g. offsetStoreForExactlyOnceSourceTask), but the KafkaOffsetBackingStore.offsetLog field field is only initialized inside of configure(WorkerConfig). Rather than making OffsetBackingStore implementations close the consumer even when configure is not called, I made the test use a more realistic lifecycle and actually call configure(WorkerConfig) and stop().\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

patch fixes how the SASL/GSSAPI server is created in Kafka brokers. \r\nAs described in the JIRA ticket, Kafka forces client JAAS configuration for both client and server side.\r\nThis patch removes the constraint and allows to accept authentication addressed at different hosts.\r\nIf the listener is used for the inter-broker communication, it must stay in the current form.\r\n\r\nAssume that Kafka cluster is accessible using `CLIENT` listener that each broker is accessible at `b-N.kafka.sample.home.arpa:9092` (N is broker id). For convenience the bootstrap uses load balanced endpoint `kafka.sample.home.arpa:9092`  that distributes the traffic to the active brokers.\r\n\r\nAfter this patch it is possible to configure the listener's JAAS configuration to use wildcard principal:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlistener.name.client.gssapi.sasl.jaas.config=com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required\r\n  useKeyTab=true\r\n  storeKey=true\r\n  keyTab=\"/etc/kafka/security/kafka.keytab\"\r\n  principal=\"*\"\r\n  isInitiator=false\r\n; \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe goal of this patch is to enable wildcard principal and acceptor-only mode (isInitiator=false).\r\n\r\nThe keytab must contain entries for SPNs on all acceptable service FQDNs, i.e. on broker 0 we must have entries for both `kafka/kafka.sample.home.arpa@DOMAIN` and `kafka/b-0.kafka.sample.home.arpa@DOMAIN`.\r\n\r\nThe patch does not change behavior of the existing configurations.\r\n\r\nFor this patch the only reasonable testing strategy is manual one. That's the reason that even if the solution was already known 3 years ago, the code has not been submitted.\r\n\r\nAny ideas for automated testing of this change are warmly welcome.\r\n\r\nThe comparison for various ways to configure SASL:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/piotrsmolinski/kerberos-sandbox/blob/main/src/test/java/io/confluent/sandbox/kerberos/KerberosTest.java\r\n\r\n### Committer

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-997%3A++Support+fetch%28fromKey%2C+toKey%2C+from%2C+to%29+to+WindowRangeQuery+and+unify+WindowKeyQuery+and+WindowRangeQuery\r\n\r\nWe aim to enhance the WindowRangeQuery  by supporting a new method: fetch(keyFrom, keyTo, from, to). Currently, WindowRangeQuery  utilizes KeyValueIterator<Windowed<K>, V> fetchAll(Instant timeFrom, Instant timeTo)  for retrieving all key-value pairs within a specified time range. However, we propose to use KeyValueIterator<Windowed<K>, V> fetch(K keyFrom, K keyTo, Instant timeFrom, Instant timeTo)  instead. This new method will provide a KeyValueIterator<Windowed<K>, V>  that allows users to iterate over windowed key-value pairs {{\r\n\r\n{<Windowed<K>, value>}\r\n}} , spanning the entire time range.\r\n\r\nWith this new method, users can retrieve window sessions for specific keys, rather than all keys, which enables a more targeted query. This is an improvement over the fetchAll  method, which only allows retrieval of all key's window sessions without the ability to specify a range of keys.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this enhancement also allows the WindowRangeQuery  to support WindowKeyQuery  functionality. Users seeking to query window sessions for a specific key can do so by setting keyFrom  and keyTo  to be equal. This dual functionality provides more flexibility and efficiency in querying windowed keys.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation
