pull request adds support for 3D deconvolution when compiled with cudnn and run on GPU. It does not break the current 2D Deconvolution non-cudnn code and simply throws an error if the non-cudnn code is called with a 3D kernel.\r\n\r\nAs the non-gpu version does not support 3D deconvolution, this pull request does not add test cases to compare that their output is similar. Instead I manually compared the output to the PyTorch 3D Deconvolution implementation.\r\n\r\nI have seen that the cudnn convolution code uses `DMLC_DECLARE_FIELD(workspace).set_default(1024).set_range(0, 8192)`. Shall the cudnn deconvolution code be adapted to use a default of 1024 for as well? Currently the default is 512.\r\n\r\nThe following code can be used to compare with PyTorch:\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\nTEST = \"3D_TM\"\r\n\r\nif TEST

if we include `MxNetCpp.h` in several `.cpp` files, linker will complains that there are multiple definition of mxnet.cpp functions, because of [one definition rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Definition_Rule).\r\n\r\nThis commit do several modifications to obey the one definition rule:\r\n1. Add `inline` keyword to functions.\r\n2. Get rid of global variable, use static class variable instead.\r\n3. In `optimizer.hpp`, I delayed the registration of sgd optimizer to the first call of OptimizerRegistry::Find.\r\n4. In `kvstore.hpp`, two callback functions (`updater` and `controller`) are now `KVStore`'s static member functions. Also, `extern \"C\"` is removed because I think it is not necessary when the function is callbacked by function pointer (However, I'm not 100% sure on this point, please correct me if I'm wrong).\r\n\r\ncc @lx75249 , thank

would like to contribute another form of bulk execution to MXNet than the one recently merged (@tqchen in #2462, #2496, @eric-haibin-lin in #5220).\r\n\r\nI started development on this approach for use in my own projects before encountering the existing effort. It achieves the same type of speedup - launching GPU kernels without synchronization in between - but in a slightly different way and hopefully with some advantages.\r\n\r\nInstead of grouping operations in the execution graph, this approach uses an engine implementation that allows asynchronous GPU kernels to be used as operations - i.e. launching kernels without _cudaStreamSynchronize_ as part of the engine operation. The engine identifies operations that can be run without synchronization and runs sequences of such operations in parallel on different GPU streams, scheduling individual dependent ops on the same stream. In separate threads, synchronization on the streams is performed when necessary (coordination with CPU/memory ops and GPU ops with multiple dependencies). Please see the implementation or ask for more details. Some characteristics:\r\n- It works for ops with multiple dependencies - it will schedule ops in bulk and in parallel when all but one dependency has completed (scheduled on stream of non-finished dependency).\r\n- Works for all engine uses: graphs, ndarray ops and others. Especially allows for bulk execution without using the graph subsystem.\r\n- Allows for full parallelism even for fine operations without trade-offs. It will schedule parallel operations on different streams \"live\" - i.e. no need to pre-group operations and strike a balance between parallelism and bulk benefits using a preset max bulk node number.\r\n\r\nI believe especially the last two points could be advantageous compared to the new bulk system. I could be wrong, maybe @eric-haibin-lin could clarify on this?\r\n\r\nI've done some basic benchmarking locally and compared to baseline I achieve similar speedups to the new bulk system:\r\n\r\n|Scenario | Time|\r\n|---|---|\r\n|Baseline | 178.256|\r\n|Bulk Inference | 157.612 (~1.13 speedup)|\r\n|Streaming Engine | 151.960 (~1.17 speedup)|\r\n|Bulk Inference + Streaming Engine | 162.525 (~1.10 speedup)|\r\n\r\nWhere the scenarios above correspond to:\r\n- Baseline\r\n```\r\n   # Disable bulk system\r\n   export MXNET_EXEC_BULK_EXEC_TRAIN=0\r\n   export MXNET_EXEC_BULK_EXEC_MAX_NODE_TRAIN=0\r\n   export MXNET_EXEC_BULK_EXEC_INFERENCE=0\r\n   python lstm_bucketing.py --num-layers 5 --num-hidden 64 --gpus 0\r\n```\r\n- Bulk Inference\r\n```\r\n   python lstm_bucketing.py --num-layers 5 --num-hidden 64 --gpus 0\r\n```\r\n- Streaming Engine\r\n```\r\n   # Disable bulk system\r\n   export MXNET_EXEC_BULK_EXEC_TRAIN=0\r\n   export MXNET_EXEC_BULK_EXEC_MAX_NODE_TRAIN=0\r\n   export MXNET_EXEC_BULK_EXEC_INFERENCE=0\r\n   export MXNET_ENGINE_TYPE=StreamingEnginePerDevice\r\n   python lstm_bucketing.py --num-layers 5 --num-hidden 64 --gpus 0\r\n```\r\n- Bulk Inference + Streaming Engine\r\n```\r\n   export MXNET_ENGINE_TYPE=StreamingEnginePerDevice\r\n   python lstm_bucketing.py --num-layers 5 --num-hidden 64 --gpus 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI currently only have access to a MacBook Pro with a single Geforce GT 650M GPU, so maybe someone could do more complete benchmarking and comparisons with the new bulk system (@eric-haibin-lin?), especially on Linux. The implementation uses lockless queues and the efficiency depends on the performance of the platform semaphore primitive, so I'm afraid performance may vary across platforms. I plan to do more benchmarking myself, but will be travelling for a month now with no access to my development environment, so I thought it would be nice with some early feedback on the current system, its design and see if there is any interest.\r\n\r\nThe implementation depends on the fast lockless queue (part BSD license and part zlib license) from\r\n    https://github.com/cameron314/concurrentqueue\r\nincluded verbatim in the PR as two header files (renamed, so not to be included in lint checks). This dependency could be removed with some performance penalties.\r\n\r\nAll tests and lint checks pass on my end and all network architectures I've tried works well. Still, it would probably be a good idea to have someone more experienced in MXNet internals check logic.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope this PR is of interest to the community!","created_at":"2017-03-23T11:35:16Z","updated_at":"2017-06-29T08:01:44Z","closed_at":"2017-06-27T17:17:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c93f29fa2500b0e4435bb666856bcbb7df98d60f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/5542/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/5542/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5542/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/ae61b05c4c61c14b488d815a5b874674b1d177e4","head":{"label":"martin82:streamingengine","ref":"streamingengine","sha":"ae61b05c4c61c14b488d815a5b874674b1d177e4","user":{"login":"martin82","id":1439328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1439328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82","html_url":"https://github.com/martin82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":84421724,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NDQyMTcyNA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"martin82/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"martin82","id":1439328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzkzMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1439328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82","html_url":"https://github.com/martin82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/martin82/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,
