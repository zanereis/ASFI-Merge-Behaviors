is a follow up on PR 232 on mshadow and a prerequisite to PR 5726 on MxNet. With this change, the newest version of mshadow is brought into MxNet. Though the changed value for kMaxGridNum would crash several operators as they had been using this value as the size of the grid in a single dimension. Now there is kMaxGridDim in mshadow that specifies the max size in one dimension and all affected operators are updated to use this value instead of kMaxGridNum.\r\n\r\nPR 5726 (sampling operators) depends on this change here as it has to bring in the latest mshadow.

multiple distributions that are parametrized by input arguments(tensors)\r\n\r\nThis pull request depends on PR 228 for mshadow! \r\nI'm insecure how we proceed as this PR will fail as long as PR 228 has not yet been pulled. \r\n\r\nThis branch adds methods to sample from more often used distributions: Exponential/Gamma/Poisson/Negative Binomial. All these sampling methods are currently only available for CPU. They are available for ndarray and symbolic APIs. Moreover a set of \"multi-sample\" operators is available where distribution parameters are tensor inputs. With this, MxNet can be used to estimate parameters of a probability distribution by a neural network and then sample from this distribution and feed the sampling then into other parts of a neural network. That is a critical functionality used for a lot of applications and similar to what TensorFlow offers. \r\nTests have been added to test_random.py for all these changes.\r\nIn the future, we may think about extending and unifying the random samplers further. Goal should be to have additional operators in there for example for likelihood. And provide GPU versions for all distribution types.
