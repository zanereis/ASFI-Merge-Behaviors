R users usually use read.df() to read the csv file. So we need a more high-level api about it.\r\n\r\nJava:\r\n[DataFrameReader.csv()](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/org/apache/spark/sql/DataFrameReader.html)\r\n\r\nScala:\r\n[DataFrameReader.csv()](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/DataFrameReader.html#csv(paths:String*):org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame)\r\n\r\nPython:\r\n[DataFrameReader.csv()](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrameReader.csv.html#pyspark.sql.DataFrameReader.csv)\r\n\r\nR base library \"utils\" has introduced the namespace of \"read.csv\". So this api has changed the name from \"read.csv\" to \"read.spark.csv\" to avoid the conflict.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, read.spark.csv and write.spark.csv are introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remoove the Arrow in AppVeyor for now to recover the build.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSparkR does not support Arrow 9.0.0 ([SPARK-40114](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40114)) so the tests fail (https://ci.appveyor.com/project/HyukjinKwon/spark/builds/44490387)\r\n\r\nShould recover the tests first because it looks it's going to take a while to add the Arrow 9.0.0 support.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI in this PR should test it

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade RocksDB JNI library from 7.4.4 to 7.4.5.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRocksdbjni 7.4.5 only contains one patch compared with version 7.4.4 and this patch fixes a bug that causes data loss:\r\n\r\n- [Fix serious FSDirectory use-after-Close bug (missing fsync) ](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/10460)\r\n\r\n```\r\nFix a bug starting in 7.4.0 in which some fsync operations might be skipped in a DB after any DropColumnFamily on that DB, until it is re-opened. This can lead to data loss on power loss. (For custom FileSystem implementations, this could lead to FSDirectory::Fsync or FSDirectory::Close after the first FSDirectory::Close; Also, valgrind could report call to close() with fd=-1.)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe release note as follows:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/releases/tag/v7.4.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass GA\r\n- The benchmark result :\r\n\r\n**Before 7.4.4**\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Running org.apache.spark.util.kvstore.RocksDBBenchmark\r\n

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIntroduce a new SQL function `get()`: Returns element of array at given (0-based) index. If the index points\r\n     outside of the array boundaries, then this function returns NULL.\r\n    Examples:\r\n```\r\n> SELECT _FUNC_(array(1, 2, 3), 2);\r\n  2\r\n> SELECT _FUNC_(array(1, 2, 3), 3);\r\n  NULL\r\n> SELECT _FUNC_(array(1, 2, 3), -1);\r\n  NULL\r\n```\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, when accessing array element with invalid index under ANSI SQL mode, the error is like:\r\n```\r\n[INVALID_ARRAY_INDEX] The index -1 is out of bounds. The array has 3 elements. Use `try_element_at` and increase the array index by 1(the starting array index is 1 for `try_element_at`) to tolerate accessing element at invalid index and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error.\r\n```\r\nThe provided solution is complicated. I suggest introducing a new method `get()` which always returns null on an invalid array index. This is from https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/get.html.\r\n\r\nNote: since Spark's map access always returns null, let's don't support map type in the get method for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, a new SQL function `get()`: returns element of array at given (0-based) index. If the index points\r\n     outside of the array boundaries, then this function returns NULL.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis fixes https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40089 where the prefix can overflow in some cases and the code assumes that the overflow is always on the negative side, not the positive side.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis adds a check when the overflow does happen to know what is the proper prefix to return.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, unless you consider getting the sort order correct a user facing change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- skip adding a repartition if the top level node of CTE is rebalance\r\n- use RepartitionByExpression instead of Repartition so that AQE can coalesce the shuffle partition\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf cte can not inlined, the ReplaceCTERefWithRepartition will add repartition to force a shuffle so that the reference can reuse shuffle exchange.\r\nThe added repartition should be optimized by AQE for better performance.\r\n\r\nIf the user has specified a rebalance, the ReplaceCTERefWithRepartition should skip add repartition.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, only improve performance\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nExtend Catalyst's type system by a new type: `Int128Type` represents the `Int128`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark SQL today supports the `Decimal` data type. The implementation of Spark `Decimal` holds a `BigDecimal` or `Long` value. Spark `Decimal` provides some operators like +, -, *, /, % and so on. These operators rely heavily on the computational power of `BigDecimal` or `Long` itself. For ease of understanding, take the + as an example. The implementation shows below.\r\n```\r\n  def + (that: Decimal): Decimal = {\r\n    if (decimalVal.eq(null) && that.decimalVal.eq(null) && scale == that.scale) {\r\n      Decimal(longVal + that.longVal, Math.max(precision, that.precision) + 1, scale)\r\n    } else {\r\n      Decimal(toBigDecimal.bigDecimal.add(that.toBigDecimal.bigDecimal))\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nWe can see the `+` of `Long` will be called if Spark `Decimal` holds a `Long` value. Otherwise, the add of `BigDecimal` will be called if Spark `Decimal` holds a `BigDecimal` value. The other operators of Spark `Decimal` adopt the similar way. Furthermore, the code shown above calls `Decimal.apply` to construct a new instance of Spark `Decimal`. As we know, the add operator of `BigDecimal` constructed a new instance of `BigDecimal`. So, if we call the + operator of Spark `Decimal` who holds a `Long` value, Spark will construct a new instance of `Decimal`. Otherwise, Spark will construct a new instance of `BigDecimal` and a new instance of `Decimal`.\r\nThrough rough analysis, we know:\r\n1. The computational power of Spark `Decimal` may depend on `BigDecimal`.\r\n2. The calculation operators of Spark `Decimal` create a lot of new instances of `Decimal` and may create a lot of new instances of `BigDecimal`.\r\nIf a large table has a field called `'colA` whose type is Spark `Decimal`, the execution of `SUM('colA)` will involve the creation of a large number of Spark `Decimal` instances and `BigDecimal` instances. These Spark `Decimal` instances and `BigDecimal` instances will lead to garbage collection frequently.\r\n\r\nIn this new feature, we will introduce Int128 type.\r\n`Int128` is a high-performance data type about 2X~10X more efficient than Spark `Decimal` for typical operations. It uses a finite (128 bit) precision and can handle up to decimal(38, X). The implementation of `Int128` just uses two `Long` values to represent the high and low bits of 128 bits respectively. `Int128` is lighter than Spark `Decimal`, reduces the cost of `new()` and garbage collection.\r\n\r\nThis is a starting PR. See more details in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40097\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, a new data type for `Int128`. It is still in development.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew test cases.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-16T10:56:38Z","updated_at":"2022-11-29T07:09:50Z","closed_at":"2022-11-28T00:19:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a8bbad727d926896df2107ff6e74238544cf0eec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37536/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37536/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37536/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/81a99f9495d90991440ba025c137322f35abe0ce","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-40100","ref":"SPARK-40100","sha":"81a99f9495d90991440ba025c137322f35abe0ce","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR will run `scheduleShuffleMergeFinalize()` and send `finalizeShuffleMerge` RPCs in two threads, and stop all work after `PUSH_BASED_SHUFFLE_MERGE_RESULTS_TIMEOUT` regardless of sucess or failure.\r\n\r\nNow we will only call `removeShufflePushMergerLocation` when shuffle fetch fails, this PR will also prevent these merger nodes from bing selected as mergeLocations when creating connections fails. Adding those bad merge nodes to finalizeBlackNodes, so subsequent shuffle map stages will not try to connect them.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDAGSchuedler will finalize each shuffle map stage in one `shuffle-merge-finalizer` thread,  and lock `clientPool.locks[clientIndex]` when creating connect to the ESS merger node, the other  `shuffle-merge-finalizer` threads (one stage per thread) will wait for `SPARK_NETWORK_IO_CONNECTIONCREATIONTIMEOUT_KEY`.\r\nAlthough reducing `SPARK_NETWORK_IO_CONNECTIONCREATIONTIMEOUT_KEY` helps, the total wait time( SPARK_NETWORK_IO_CONNECTIONCREATIONTIMEOUT_KEY * lostMergerNodesSize * stageSize ) will still be long. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nClean up the semantics of spark task listeners. Today, if a task body succeeds, but a completion listener fails, failure listeners are not called -- even tho the task has indeed failed at that point. The fix is to invoke failure listeners if a completion listener fails, before running the remaining completion listeners.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFailure listeners are not reliably called today, if the task failure is caused by a failed completion listener. This limits the utility of task listeners, especially ones that could assist with task cleanup.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo changes to public methods, but failure listeners will now run when a completion listener fails, where previously they did not.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests exercise various combinations of failed listeners, with a task body that did (or did not) throw.","created_at":"2022-08-16T03:44:41Z","updated_at":"2022-08-19T02:14:27Z","closed_at":"2022-08-18T22:51:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"78d570eda605c325d852d0903a969795830aebf4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37531/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37531/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37531/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d1668b449cedbc77d51df767cc1c55b8fddb52d6","head":{"label":"ryan-johnson-databricks:task-failure-listeners","ref":"task-failure-listeners","sha":"d1668b449cedbc77d51df767cc1c55b8fddb52d6","user":{"login":"ryan-johnson-databricks","id":79601771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjAxNzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79601771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks","html_url":"https://github.com/ryan-johnson-databricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":523479704,"node_id":"R_kgDOHzOqmA","name":"spark","full_name":"ryan-johnson-databricks/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ryan-johnson-databricks","id":79601771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjAxNzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79601771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks","html_url":"https://github.com/ryan-johnson-databricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ryan-johnson-databricks/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a followup on SPARK-39895. The PR previously attempted to adjust implementation for R as well to match signatures but that part was removed and we only focused on getting python implementation to behave correctly.\r\n\r\nChange supports following operations:\r\n```R\r\ndf <- select(read.json(jsonPath), \"name\", \"age\")\r\n\r\ndf$age2 <- df$age\r\n\r\ndf1 <- drop(df, df$age, df$name)\r\nexpect_equal(columns(df1),

c(\"age2\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFollowup on previous PR\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, adds support for multiple \"Column\" drop in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nToday, we use `IllegalStateException` a lot in the Spark codebase to indicate bugs, while there is no official java doc saying that `IllegalStateException` means bugs. This leads to trouble when we want to report INTERNAL_ERROR error class to end users when bug happens. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39412\r\n\r\nThis PR is the first step to make a switch: it adds a new util function `SparkException.internalError` to create `SparkException` with error class INTERNAL_ERROR. We can use it to replace `IllegalStateException` in the spark codebase. This PR updates `Expression.scala`.\r\n\r\nNote: given the amount of `IllegalStateException` in the codebase, we don't expect the switch to be fast. But at least newly added code should use it to indicate bugs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nbetter error reporting\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to introduce new SQL config `spark.sql.error.messageFormat` to control the format of Spark SQL error messages. The config can have at least the following string values:\r\n1. PRETTY - textual form of error messages including error class/sub-class, message itself + query context in text form.\r\n2. MINIMAL - JSON representation of `SparkThrowable`. Compact form w/ minimal set of fields. Aims to be parsed machinery.\r\n3. STANDARD - JSON form contains the same set of fields as MINIMAL + message.\r\n\r\nAdded new method `getMessage()` to `SparkThrowableHelper` which formats `SparkThrowable` + `Throwable` according to the requested format (see the SQL config). When the format is **MINIMAL** or **STANDARD**, the JSON record includes the following fields:\r\n- `errorClass` - human-readable, unique, and consistent representation of the error category. It is a string.\r\n- `errorSubClass` - optional sub-class of the error class as a string. **It may be missing** in the result string.\r\n- `sqlState` - optional string w/ error identifier across SQL engines. **It may be missing** in the result string.\r\n- `message` - the message template from `error-classes.json`. It is included to JSON when the format is STANDARD.\r\n- `messageParameters` - a map of message parameter names to its values.\r\n- `queryContext` - an array of query contexts of the error message which the following JSON fields. **If it is empty, the array is not outputted**:\r\n    - `objectType` - the string represents the object type of the query which throws the exception. If the exception is directly from the main query, it should be **an empty string**.\r\n    - `objectName` - the string represents the object name of the query which throws the exception. If the exception is directly from the main query, it should be **an empty string**.\r\n    - `startIndex` - the integer represents the starting index in the query text which throws the exception. The index starts from 1. If the index is unknown, **the field is not outputted**.\r\n    - `stopIndex` - the integer represents the stopping index in the query which throws the exception. The index starts from 1. If the index is unknown, **the field is not outputted**.\r\n    - `fragment` - the string represents the corresponding fragment of the query which throws the exception. If the query fragment **cannot be identified, the string is empty.**\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n**MINIMAL**\r\n```json\r\n{\"errorClass\":\"DIVIDE_BY_ZERO\",\"sqlState\":\"22012\",\"messageParameters\":{\"config\":\"\\\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\\\"\"} ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**STANDARD**\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"errorClass\" : \"DIVIDE_BY_ZERO\",\r\n  \"message\" : \"Division by zero. Use `try_divide` to tolerate divisor being 0 and return NULL instead. If necessary set <config> to \\\"false\\\" to bypass this error.\",\r\n  \"sqlState\" : \"22012\",\r\n  \"messageParameters\" : {\r\n    \"config\" : \"\\\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\\\"\"\r\n  },\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `errorClass` is `null`, Spark outputs the error message in the legacy form where:\r\n- `errorClass` is `LEGACY`\r\n- `messageParameters` is an array w/ only one elements as a string. The element contains textual error message.\r\n\r\nIn the case if the specified format is **PRETTY**, Spark follows existing behavior and outputs error message as plain text, for example:\r\n```\r\n[DIVIDE_BY_ZERO] Division by zero. Use `try_divide` to tolerate divisor being 0 and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error.\r\n== SQL(line 1, position 8) ==\r\nselect 1 / 0\r\n       ^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR modifies the Thrift server to output the error messages according to current value of the SQL config `spark.sql.error.messageFormat`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Spark SQL client tools need to parse out relevant information like parameters and positions in order to render messages to their liking. This makes the API fickle, hard to change, and limits degrees of freedom for UI.\r\n- Updates to error message texts result in a need to discover and update QA tests being affected. This makes it expensive to improve error-messages and prevents e.g. tech writers from taking ownership down the road.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support eliminate the `Sort` if there is a `LocalLimit` between `Join`/`Aggregate`/`Sort` and `Sort`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt can't eliminate the sort by default in some cases, but it can eliminate the sort if we exclude `LimitPushDown`(`SET spark.sql.optimizer.excludedRules=org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.LimitPushDown`). This is because it can't eliminate the sort if the limit is pushed through a join. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT *                                \r\nFROM   (SELECT *                        \r\n        FROM   testdata                 \r\n        ORDER  BY key) t1               \r\n       CROSS JOIN (SELECT *             \r\n                   FROM   testdata2     \r\n                   ORDER  BY a) t2      \r\nLIMIT  2                                \r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nGlobalLimit 2\r\n+- LocalLimit 2\r\n   +- Join Cross\r\n      :- LocalLimit 2\r\n      :  +- Sort [key#13 ASC NULLS FIRST], true\r\n      :     +-

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd subquery partitioning pruning support to V2 file sources, and subsequently DPP as well because that mechanism is used for the subquery partition pruning. To do this, a new API is added, `SupportsRuntimeCatalystFilters`, similar to `SupportsPushDownCatalystFilters`. File sources implement this interface and return partition columns as runtime filterable attributes. This inherently adds support for DPP. BatchScanExec is updated to first check if a scan supports runtime catalyst filters and pushes those down before checking for runtime v2 filters.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, subquery filters on partition columns are wrapped in `DynamicPruningExpression` to automatically get used as runtime filters. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo support V1 file source features in the V2 implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, adds subquery partitioning pruning and DPP to V2 file source.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nA new test was added for the subquery behavior, and the `DynamicPartitionPruningSuite` was updated with a new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd code to defensively check if the pre-allocated result array is big enough to handle the next element in a date or timestamp sequence.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`InternalSequenceBase.getSequenceLength` is a fast method for estimating the size of the result array. It uses an estimated step size in micros which is not always entirely accurate for the date/time/time-zone combination. As a result, `getSequenceLength` occasionally overestimates the size of the result array and also occasionally underestimates the size of the result array.\r\n\r\n`getSequenceLength` sometimes overestimates the size of the result array when the step size is in months (because `InternalSequenceBase` assumes 28 days per month). This case is handled: `InternalSequenceBase` will slice the array, if needed.\r\n\r\n`getSequenceLength` sometimes underestimates the size of the result array when the sequence crosses a DST \"spring forward\" without a corresponding \"fall backward\". This case is not handled (thus, this PR).\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nselect sequence(\r\n  timestamp'2022-03-13 00:00:00',\r\n  timestamp'2022-03-14 00:00:00',\r\n  interval 1 day) as x;\r\n```\r\nIn the America/Los_Angeles time zone, this results in the following error:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 1\r\n\tat scala.runtime.ScalaRunTime$.array_update(ScalaRunTime.scala:77)\r\n```\r\nThis happens because `InternalSequenceBase` calculates an estimated step size of 24 hours. If you add 24 hours to 2022-03-13 00:00:00 in the America/Los_Angeles time zone, you get 2022-03-14 01:00:00 (because 2022-03-13 has only 23 hours due to \"spring forward\"). Since 2022-03-14 01:00:00 is later than the specified stop value, `getSequenceLength` assumes the stop value is not included in the result. Therefore, `getSequenceLength` estimates an array size of 1.\r\n\r\nHowever, when actually creating the sequence, `InternalSequenceBase` does not use a step of 24 hours, but of 1 day. When you add 1 day to 2022-03-13 00:00:00, you get 2022-03-14 00:00:00. Now the stop value *is* included, and we overrun the end of the result array.\r\n\r\nThe new unit test includes examples of problematic date sequences.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds code to to handle the underestimation case: it checks if we're about to overrun the array, and if so, gets a new array that's larger by 1.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-14T16:23:27Z","updated_at":"2022-08-29T15:21:01Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T08:54:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2653bb4dc4cd677740212c8d24a7dbe24584bf2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37513/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37513/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37513/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5d1748f9def2b5814e49d5aaaa1dfdcd6273a326","head":{"label":"bersprockets:date_sequence_array_size_issue","ref":"date_sequence_array_size_issue","sha":"5d1748f9def2b5814e49d5aaaa1dfdcd6273a326","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn this PR, we propose to revert #37325 [SPARK-39902](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39902) to replace newly added `Scan#name()` with existing `Table#name()` API to populate the BatchScan node with table in SparkUI.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n[SPARK-39902](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39902) introduced new public API `Scan#name()`. However, the same can be achieved using the already existing `Table#name()` API and some code refactoring, thereby making the newly added API moot.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nTechnically no, since [SPARK-39902](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39902) already introduced the Table name in the BatcnScan node in SparkUI. This is just an alternate implementation\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n- Tested this change using existing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis fixes a bug where ConfigMap is not mounted on executors if they are under a non-default resource profile.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen `spark.kubernetes.executor.disableConfigMap` is `false`, expected behavior is that the ConfigMap is mounted regardless of executor's resource profile. However, it is not mounted if the resource profile is non-default.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExecutors with non-default resource profile will have the ConfigMap mounted that was missing before if `spark.kubernetes.executor.disableConfigMap` is `false` or default. If certain users need to keep that behavior for some reason, they would need to explicitly set `spark.kubernetes.executor.disableConfigMap` to `true`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nA new test case is added just below the existing ConfigMap test case.","created_at":"2022-08-13T01:50:33Z","updated_at":"2022-08-20T01:30:32Z","closed_at":"2022-08-19T19:29:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"473e8176318f9c05361a4703b15ffdba2241731f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37504/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37504/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37504/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/de5c8e514189a22567cd5d3dea9ced6434d91afb","head":{"label":"nsuke:SPARK-40065","ref":"SPARK-40065","sha":"de5c8e514189a22567cd5d3dea9ced6434d91afb","user":{"login":"nsuke","id":3064114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjQxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3064114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke","html_url":"https://github.com/nsuke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":524237341,"node_id":"R_kgDOHz86HQ","name":"spark","full_name":"nsuke/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nsuke","id":3064114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjQxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3064114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke","html_url":"https://github.com/nsuke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nsuke/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nChange the syntax of map column access under ANSI mode: always return null results instead of throwing `MAP_KEY_DOES_NOT_EXIST`  errors.\r\nThis PR also remove an internal `spark.sql.ansi.strictIndexOperator`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSince https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30386, Spark always throws an error on invalid access to a map column. There is no such syntax in the ANSI SQL standard since there is no Map type in it. There is a similar type `multiset` which returns null on non-existing element access.\r\nAlso, I investigated PostgreSQL/Snowflake/Biguqery and all of them returns null return on map(json) key not exists.\r\nI suggest loosen the the syntax here. When users get the error, most of them will just use `try_element_at()` to get the same syntax or just turn off the ANSI SQL mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, see above\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix a bug in column DEFAULT support for non-vectorized Parquet scans, where inserting explicit NULL values to a column with a DEFAULT and then selecting the column back would sometimes erroneously return the default value. \r\n\r\nTo exercise the behavior:\r\n\r\n```\r\nset spark.sql.parquet.enableVectorizedReader=false;\r\ncreate table t(a int) using parquet;\r\ninsert into t values (42);\r\nalter table t add column b int default 42;\r\ninsert into t values (43, null);\r\nselect * from t;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should return two rows:\r\n\r\n`(42, 42) and (43, NULL)`\r\n\r\nBut instead the scan missed the inserted NULL value, and returned the existence DEFAULT value of \"42\" instead:\r\n\r\n`(42, 42) and (43, 42)`.\r\n\r\nAfter this bug fix, Spark now returns the former correct result.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis fixes the correctness of SQL queries using Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe PR includes unit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to add `ReplaceNullWithFalseInPredicateWithAQEEndToEndSuite ` i.e. test cases of `ReplaceNullWithFalseInPredicateEndToEndSuite` with AQE (Adaptive Query Execution) turned on.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently `ReplaceNullWithFalseInPredicateEndToEndSuite` assumes that AQE is always turned off. We should also test with AQE turned on\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded an AQE version tests along with the non

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRefactor path filter logic in HadoopFSUtils to avoid the same filter logic is applied to a file multiple time. Method listLeafFiles is called recursively. Especially, this filter will be used in single thread on all files at driver side. This will lead to a performance issue when the filter logic is heavy. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nApply filter only on filestatus as soon as they are firstly met.\r\n\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, V2 expressions missing the default `toString` and lead to unexpected result or duplicate code.\r\nThis PR creates a new abstract class `AbstractExpression` so as we can add default `toString` using `ToStringSQLBuilder`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe default `toString` could reuse `ToStringSQLBuilder` so that avoid duplicate code.\r\nThe default `toString` also let developers no need implement `toString`, when creating a new V2 expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nJust update the inner implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

2|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR it returns the expected result:\r\n```\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  a|  a|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  1|  1|\r\n|  1|  2|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, fixes a correctness issue.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UTs.","created_at":"2022-08-12T08:06:52Z","updated_at":"2022-08-15T00:02:29Z","closed_at":"2022-08-15T00:02:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"13e61979a26abf1ee796879f5ffcf1c97a155d5d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37491/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37491/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37491/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a56c75aea053884af9deb36abe414e5aa0e0b2d1","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-39887-keep-attributes-of-unions-first-child-3.2","ref":"SPARK-39887-keep-attributes-of-unions-first-child-3.2","sha":"a56c75aea053884af9deb36abe414e5aa0e0b2d1","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr add some `assume` conditions to dynamic ingored cases which requiring Python runtime environment:\r\n\r\n- \"UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE: Using Python UDF with unsupported join condition\" in `QueryCompilationErrorsSuite` should be ignored when `shouldTestPythonUDFs` is false\r\n- Split \"Check source for different kind of UDFs\" in `ExpressionInfoSuite` into two cases, \"Check source for Python UDF\" should be ignored when `shouldTestPythonUDFs` is false\r\n- All test in `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` should be ignored when `isPythonVersionAtLeast` is false, additionally, this PR simplifies the filter conditions of `testingVersions` in `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` due to EOL versions has been deleted from https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/spark\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe tests which requiring Python runtime environment should not `ABORTED` when python running

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor the following query\r\n```\r\nSET spark.sql.ansi.enabled=true;\r\nSELECT try_cast(1/0 AS string); \r\n```\r\nSpark 3.3 will throw an exception for the division by zero error. In the current master branch, it returns null after the refactoring PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36703\r\n\r\nThis PR is to restore the previous error handling syntax.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. Restore the behavior of try_cast()\r\n2. The previous syntax is more reasonable. Users can cleanly catch the exception from the child of `try_cast`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37293. The patch proposes to use `hasArray()` API to check if a `ByteBuffer` has an underlying array that could be leveraged for direct access.\r\n\r\nIf the condition is not met, the code falls back to the original way of handling things using `ByteBuffer` API instead of an array.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes a potential issue of using direct byte buffers in Parquet-MR and makes the code forward-compatible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. This is an internal change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI have updated ParquetDeltaEncodingSuite to check both direct and non-direct byte buffers. I verified that the tests fail before the fix with ` java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException:` and pass with the fix.\r\n\r\nI reran `DataSourceReadBenchmark` to ensure this `if-else` does not have a significant impact on performance.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark was rerun on the same machine for both cases sequentially (each of them used a different JVM process).\r\n\r\nBenchmarks show that `if` statement does not have significant impact for on-heap `ByteBuffers` backed with an array so there should not be any performance regression for the use case being addressed by @LuciferYang.\r\n\r\n###

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nImprovements for `TO_BINARY`:\r\n- `base64` behaves more strictly, i.e. does not allow symbols not included in base64 dictionary (A-Za-z0-9+/) and verifies correct padding and symbol groups (see RFC 4648 § 4). Whitespaces are ignored. Current implementation allows arbitrary strings and invalid symbols are skipped.\r\n- `hex` converts only valid hexadecimal strings and throws errors otherwise. Whitespaces are not allowed.\r\n- `utf-8` and `utf8` are interchangeable.\r\n- Correct errors are thrown and classified for invalid input (CONVERSION_INVALID_INPUT) and invalid format (CONVERSION_INVALID_FORMAT)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBetter handling for malformed input. Improve parity with implementation done by other engines.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, this changes existing function behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit test, `SQLQueryTestSuite`\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-11T23:10:26Z","updated_at":"2023-05-26T01:56:43Z","closed_at":"2022-09-01T02:18:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6897671060e8491078ab7506280571fcf858a5e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37483/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37483/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37483/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0ea0d27a6b6836bd55c5b7266786e0472a04c4af","head":{"label":"vitaliili-db:SC-89850","ref":"SC-89850","sha":"0ea0d27a6b6836bd55c5b7266786e0472a04c4af","user":{"login":"vitaliili-db","id":104398294,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjj91g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104398294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db","html_url":"https://github.com/vitaliili-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":486365104,"node_id":"R_kgDOHP1XsA","name":"spark","full_name":"vitaliili-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vitaliili-db","id":104398294,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjj91g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104398294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db","html_url":"https://github.com/vitaliili-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vitaliili-db/spark","description":"Apache

base has not been updated for 5 years, so can't solve by upgrading `xalan`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe vulnerability is described is [CVE-2022-34169](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9339-86wc-4qgf), better to exclude it although it's just test dependency for Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

Why are the changes needed?\r\n```\r\nselect id, data FROM testcat.ns1.ns2.table\r\nwhere id =2\r\nand md5(data) = '8cde774d6f7333752ed72cacddb05126'\r\nand trim(data) = 'a' \r\n```\r\nBased on the SQL, we currently get the filters in the following order:\r\n```\r\n// `(md5(cast(data#23 as binary)) = 8cde774d6f7333752ed72cacddb05126)) AND (trim(data#23, None) = a))` comes before `(id#22L = 2)`\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n *(1) Project [id#22L, data#23]\r\n +- *(1) Filter ((((isnotnull(data#23) AND isnotnull(id#22L)) AND (md5(cast(data#23 as binary)) = 8cde774d6f7333752ed72cacddb05126)) AND (trim(data#23, None) = a)) AND (id#22L = 2))\r\n    +- BatchScan[id#22L, data#23] class org.apache.spark.sql.connector.InMemoryTable$InMemoryBatchScan\r\n```\r\nIn this predicate order, all data needs to participate in the evaluation, even if some data does not meet the later filtering criteria and it may causes spark tasks to execute slowly.\r\n\r\nSo i think that filtering predicates that need to be evaluated should automatically be placed to the far right to avoid data that does not meet the criteria being evaluated.\r\n\r\nAs shown below:\r\n```\r\n//  `(id#22L = 2)` comes before `(md5(cast(data#23 as binary)) = 8cde774d6f7333752ed72cacddb05126)) AND (trim(data#23, None) = a))`\r\n== Physical Plan == \r\n*(1) Project [id#22L, data#23]\r\n +- *(1) Filter ((((isnotnull(data#23) AND isnotnull(id#22L)) AND (id#22L = 2) AND (md5(cast(data#23 as binary)) = 8cde774d6f7333752ed72cacddb05126)) AND (trim(data#23, None) = a)))\r\n    +- BatchScan[id#22L, data#23] class org.apache.spark.sql.connector.InMemoryTable$InMemoryBatchScan\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Add new test\r\n2. manually test：the stage execution time for reading data dropped from 6min+ to 24s\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94670132/184080594-4dc74a30-edac-4ffd-acc5-ca11c9918806.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94670132/184080424-e7c828de-2f35-461c-96f6-85c7ddfc87e1.png)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-11T06:54:24Z","updated_at":"2023-02-06T02:33:30Z","closed_at":"2023-02-06T02:33:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ff56a8e5811814f2245cd4d87f65ffc6d993aec8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

It is safe to push down because without join condition is actually a cross join.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove query performance.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently on S3 the checkpoint file manager (called `FileContextBasedCheckpointFileManager`) is available which is based on the rename operation. So when a file is opened for an atomic stream a temporary file will be used behind the scenes and when the stream is committed the file is renamed to its final location.\r\n\r\nBut on S3 the rename operation will be a file copy so it has some serious performance implication.\r\n\r\nOn Hadoop 3 there is new interface introduce called [Abortable](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/api/org/apache/hadoop/fs/Abortable.html) and S3AFileSystem has this capability. When the file is small (<= the block size) this will be a single PUT as commit and no operation if it is aborted. When the file is bigger then S3's multipart upload is used: so when the file is committed [a POST is sent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CompleteMultipartUpload.html) and when aborted [a DELETE will be sent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_AbortMultipartUpload.html) (asynchronously).\r\n\r\nThis avoids the file copying altogether.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor improving streaming performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n#### Unit test\r\n\r\nI have refactored the existing `CheckpointFileManagerTests` and run against a test filesystem which supports the `Abortable` interface (see `AbortableFileSystem` which is based on `RawLocalFileSystem`). \r\nThis way we have a unit test.\r\n\r\n#### Integration test\r\n\r\nMoreover the same test can be run against AWS S3 by using an integration test (see `AwsS3AbortableStreamBasedCheckpointFileManagerSuite`):\r\n\r\n```\r\n-> S3_PATH=<..> AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<..> AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<..> AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<..>  ./build/mvn install -pl hadoop-cloud  -Phadoop-cloud,hadoop-3,integration-test\r\n\r\nDiscovery starting.\r\nDiscovery completed in 346 milliseconds.\r\nRun starting. Expected test count is: 1\r\nAwsS3AbortableStreamBasedCheckpointFileManagerSuite:\r\n- mkdirs, list, createAtomic, open, delete, exists\r\nCommitterBindingSuite:\r\nAbortableStreamBasedCheckpointFileManagerSuite:\r\nRun completed in 14 seconds, 407 milliseconds.\r\nTotal number of tests run: 1\r\nSuites: completed 4, aborted 0\r\nTests: succeeded 1, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0\r\nAll tests passed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Performance test\r\n\r\nI have run a [small performance app](https://github.com/attilapiros/spark-ss-perf/blob/ab4c6004caffc38a218fa81fd5482a6cc07ca14f/src/main/scala/perf.scala) which uses a rate stream and foreach sink with an empty body.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nKeep the output attributes of a `Union` node's first child in the `RemoveRedundantAliases` rule to avoid correctness issues.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the result of the following query:\r\n```\r\nSELECT a, b AS a FROM (\r\n  SELECT a, a AS b FROM (SELECT a FROM VALUES (1) AS t(a))\r\n  UNION ALL\r\n  SELECT a, b FROM (SELECT a, b FROM VALUES (1, 2) AS t(a, b))\r\n)\r\n```\r\nBefore this PR the query returns the incorrect result: \r\n```\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  a|  a|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  1|  1|\r\n|  2|  2|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR it returns the expected result:\r\n```\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  a|  a|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  1|  1|\r\n|  1|  2|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, fixes a correctness issue.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UTs.","created_at":"2022-08-10T17:55:19Z","updated_at":"2022-08-12T13:44:37Z","closed_at":"2022-08-12T02:42:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"939f1f8f7b6f0439670c2c9ac6ba1d4f221d5485","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37472/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37472/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37472/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8aeeb53cf46603e35b356d38a87788467bfd02b5","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-39887-keep-attributes-of-unions-first-child-3.3","ref":"SPARK-39887-keep-attributes-of-unions-first-child-3.3","sha":"8aeeb53cf46603e35b356d38a87788467bfd02b5","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to fix the incorrect target type in the error message of the cast overflow. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select CAST(9223372036854775807L AS INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH);\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: [CAST_OVERFLOW] The value 9223372036854775807L of the type \"BIGINT\" cannot be cast to \"INTERVAL MONTH\" due to an overflow. \r\n```\r\nThe target type is **\"INTERVAL MONTH\"** instead of **\"INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH\"**.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL, and do not confuse users by incorrect error messages.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it changes user-facing error messages.\r\n\r\nAfter the changes, for the example above:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select CAST(9223372036854775807L AS INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH);\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: [CAST_OVERFLOW] The value 9223372036854775807L of the type \"BIGINT\" cannot be cast to \"INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH\" due to an

That would be possible once hadoop 3.3.5 is out...\r\n\r\nUses the StreamCapabilities probe in MAPREDUCE-7403 to identify when a\r\nPathOutputCommitter is compatible with dynamic partition overwrite.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nHadoop 3.3.5 adds a new committer in mapreduce-core which works fast and correctly on azure and gcs. (it would also work on hdfs, but its optimised for the cloud stores).\r\n\r\nThe stores and the committer do meet the requirements of Spark SQL Dynamic Partition Overwrite, so it is OK to for spark to work through it.\r\n\r\nSpark does not know this; MAPREDUCE-7403 adds a way for any PathOutputCommitter to declare that they are compatible; the IntermediateManifestCommitter will do so.\r\n(https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/4728)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nThere is documentation on the feature in the hadoop [manifest committer](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/82372d0d22e696643ad97490bc902fb6d17a6382/hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/src/site/markdown/manifest_committer.md) docs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. Unit tests in hadoop-cloud which work with hadoop versions with/without the matching change.\r\n2. New integration tests in https://github.com/hortonworks-spark/cloud-integration which require spark to be built against hadoop with the manifest committer declaring compatibility\r\n\r\nThose new integration tests include\r\n\r\n* spark sql test derived from spark's own [CloudRelationBasicSuite.scala#L212](https://github.com/hortonworks-spark/cloud-integration/blob/master/cloud-examples/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/sources/CloudRelationBasicSuite.scala#L212)\r\n* Dataset tests extended to verify support for/rejection of dynamic partition overwrite

needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL, and to conform to the SQL standard.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, it just extends existing behavior of casts.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT CAST(1.001002BD AS INTERVAL SECOND);\r\nError in query: cannot resolve 'CAST(1.001002BD AS INTERVAL SECOND)' due to data type mismatch: cannot cast decimal(7,6) to interval second; line 1 pos 7;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> SELECT CAST(1.001002BD AS INTERVAL SECOND);\r\n0 00:00:01.001002000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z cast.sql\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *CastWithAnsiOffSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a follow up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37442 that fixes the codegen of casting integrals to ANSI intervals w/ multi units. The PR removes the assert: \r\n```scala\r\nassert(it.startField == it.endField)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make codegen consistent to interpreted code, and fix the assert.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\n> select cast(dt as interval hour to second) from values(100Y) as t(dt);\r\njava.lang.AssertionError\r\nassertion failed\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\n> select cast(dt as interval hour to second) from values(100Y) as t(dt);\r\n0 00:01:40.000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z cast.sql\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-08-10T09:17:32Z","updated_at":"2022-08-10T14:46:21Z","closed_at":"2022-08-10T14:46:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b08ba7fca82826b46dc42b5ab7694f69f99c2e7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37464/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37464/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37464/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2a7064d3cb4a5fec52c44cb11b4a016e34c26c76","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:cast-integral-to-interval-followup","ref":"cast-integral-to-interval-followup","sha":"2a7064d3cb4a5fec52c44cb11b4a016e34c26c76","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd element_at in SelectedFiled and ProjectionOverSchema\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe semantics of element_at is similar with GetArrayItem and GetMapValue, so we can support do nested schema pruning if the inside data type is struct.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nFor a column schema: `c: array<struct<s1: int, s2: string>>`\r\nWith the query: `SELECT element_at(c, 1).s1`\r\nThe final pruned schema should be `c: array<struct<s1: int>>`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, only improve the performance\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen the try_cast() syntax is equivalent to the non-ansi cast,  convert TryCast as Cast without wrapping with \"TryEval\" expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. For better performance. Taking `try_cast(string_col as int)` as example, Spark will have to contact error messages from [SparkThrowableHelper. getMessage ](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ErrorInfo.scala#L86) for every invalid casting. This is actually not necessary in the try_cast function.\r\n2. More accurate nullability. If the child of try_cast is non-nullable and the casting itself is up-cast, the result should be non-nullable too.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting UT + new UT for checking the nullability","created_at":"2022-08-10T06:09:47Z","updated_at":"2022-11-20T00:22:58Z","closed_at":"2022-11-20T00:22:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7554811c217136b2f42c4ba96e6ffe2613fb69b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37460/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37460/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37460/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e2497f7963e3e648b9618b32927a9c91356c370a","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:improveTryCast","ref":"improveTryCast","sha":"e2497f7963e3e648b9618b32927a9c91356c370a","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a partial revert of SPARK-39559 which used `localHostNameForURI` to get `hostName`.\r\nThis PR aims to use INADDR_ANY back on IPv4 and IN6ADDR_ANY on IPv6.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAlthough `localHostNameForURI` works for both IPv4 and IPv6, K8s `port-forward` assumes local loop back address like `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]` instead of PodIP.\r\n```\r\n$ k port-forward pi 4040\r\nForwarding from 127.0.0.1:4040 -> 4040\r\nForwarding from [::1]:4040 -> 4040\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.","created_at":"2022-08-09T23:02:10Z","updated_at":"2022-08-10T03:07:11Z","closed_at":"2022-08-10T02:42:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f012e9b9ba8ee8237ba9b81b45c7139504f9d96c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB
