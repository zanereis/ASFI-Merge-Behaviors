https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23543 fixed an issue for which reports would have to render but not display. However, it failed to hide the FiltersPanel (wrapper of the vertical FilterBar) that gets a fixed width and shows as a blank space in reports.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n\r\n![Clipboard 2023-17-03 at 12 05 28 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/234287132-3bcafda0-efa4-4454-8b4f-343238e7b4c9.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Visit a Dashboard with existing filters\r\n2. Enter reports standalone mode with standalone=3 in the url\r\n3. Make sure the Dashboard loads while the FilterBar is hidden fully and there is no blank space\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nAs already indicated in issue #22548 there is a TypeError when using the Handlebars visualization in the raw record mode. This seems to have been caused by adding the columns as an object instead of the expected array. I have simply taken the relevant code from the table plugin and replaced the invalid code with it.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nFrom  #22548:\r\n![afbeelding](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3202998/234138950-4fd598a6-bb7c-41b3-a8a7-afd97fdcd8d9.png)\r\n\r\nLocal testing after the fix:\r\n![afbeelding](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3202998/234139427-cf15468d-0c57-417c-8fb9-4dc24ac8920b.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n* Load any dataset into a Handlebars chart\r\n* Switch to `raw records` query mode\r\n* Verify that there is no TypeError\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIt seems like packages from `superset-frontend` used to live in [`apache-superset/superset-ui`](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui), but the repository was archived, and content has been imported here.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, they still contain multiple references to the legacy repository, including links in `package.json` that are used by npm. It means that published packages on npm are still linking to the archived repository saying to not use it anymore.\r\n\r\nTo remove that confusion, I've renamed all references to `apache-superset/superset-ui` and cleaned up relevant fields in `package.json` to better support a

https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23269 I misinterpreted the encoding of the dashboard level default values for the non-temporal filters, i.e., in the following `dashboards.json_metadata`,\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"default_filters\": \"{\\\"1\\\": {\\\"baz\\\": [\\\"foo\\\"]}, \\\"2\\\": {\\\"bar\\\": \\\"foo\\\"}\",\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nonly filters which allow multiple selections (`baz`) are encoded as a list whereas non-multiple selections are encoded as a scalar (`bar`), whereas I had initially thought they were all encoded as a list.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nTested locally.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

[superset/sql_parse.py](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/sql_parse.py#L67) sqlparse.keywords.FLAGS is used.\r\nHowever, sqlparse has removed the FLAGS variable from the code [sqlparse/kewords.py](https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/blob/0.4.4/sqlparse/keywords.py).\r\n\r\nThis leads to an AttributeError when running the CLI command\r\n```\r\n$ superset db upgrade\r\nAttributeError: module 'sqlparse.keywords' has no attribute 'FLAGS'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that by replacing the sqlparse.keywords.FLAGS variable in sql_parse.py with the value originally defined in sqlparse.keywords.FLAGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\nFixes #23742 \r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, the charts are experiencing an issue where colors are being repeated even though the color palette has more colors than the chart requires. This is problematic because it can make it difficult for users to distinguish between different data points and can lead to confusion. the code will now check colors in shared label and remove the color for the list.\r\n- add a feature flag \r\n- implement a function to remove shared label color from range  \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n![before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5705598/233516271-2f98eb11-9614-4598-95e3-70e025b2c0dc.gif)\r\nAfter:\r\n![after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5705598/233516283-bde9fa2e-52fc-4e4b-a2a2-53c3154d53ed.gif)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up of [discussion](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23488#pullrequestreview-1379337190), this commit migrates the existing react-query api to redux-toolkit query.\r\n\r\ntl;dr\r\n\r\n> In order to consolidate the multiple state management solution, superset team decided to leverage the redux with toolkit in order to organize the existing redux state.\r\n> Redux toolkit also includes the rdk query package which can replace the existing react-query hooks (which is a similar solution to minimize the state of async api request) with a single solution.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\ntest all sqllab functions that run as expected before\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ]

SUMMARY\r\nThe `options` property of the `DeprecatedSelect` has its type defined from `OptionType` which extends `OptionTypeBase` and allows `any` values. Because of that, this PR adds an explicit string conversion when processing the `label` property to make sure it's a text and prevent rendering exceptions. One example of the necessary conversion is when the options have `BigNumber` as labels.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ]

SUMMARY\r\nSome charts, like Pivot Table (`groupbyRows`, `groupbyColumns`), Mixed Chart (`groupby`, `groupby_b`) or Graph (`source`, `target`) have more than 1 dimensions field in their form data.\r\nIf user started drilling by 1 field (e.g. `groupbyRows`) and then attempted further drilling by another field (e.g. `groupbyColumns`), the drilling would incorrectly apply the selected dimension to the first field instead of the second.\r\nMoreover, if a chart has multiple adhoc filter fields (Mixed Chart - `adhoc_filters` and `adhoc_filters_b`), the same problem would occur - the filter might get applied to the wrong field.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by passing the information about current drilling config to the modal, so that it knows how to construct the form data of the drilled chart.\r\n\r\nAlso, we save the history of drilling configs in the state so that the \"undo\" feature also works correctly.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds resizing to the adhoc column popover, and is based on what's currently used in the metric and filter popovers. This is often needed when writing custom SQL expressions. In addition, the height multiplier of 2 is removed from the metric and filter popovers, as it only makes intuitive sense when the popover placement is set to `left`, in which case the popover grows both upwards and downwards. Since we let AntD decide which placement to use, it makes more sense to not apply multiplier, as the popover often grows out of bounds quickly, causing weird side-effects when the placement changes. This also felt unintuitive, as the vertical movement was doubled, as opposed to horizontal movement, which was not multiplied.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the adhoc column popover is resizable:\r\n<img width=\"806\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/233337423-e379c836-7e38-4f6b-a8cc-638ab1b9c79f.png\">\r\n\r\nAlso, the removed multiplier makes the resize action be in line with the vertical mouse movement:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/233341632-b633fdba-1a5d-40a3-b909-f939c8191569.mp4\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously the adhoc column popover wasn't resizable:\r\n<img width=\"647\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/233339014-04fae34a-7808-473c-aa02-e3f4eb1be536.png\">\r\n\r\nAlso, the multiplier caused the resize action to feel unintuitive with top placement:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/233341488-04728fca-a063-43b8-9109-117801f8ae0c.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhen calling the chart data endpoint with an incorrect post processing operation, the error would get swallowed due to the reraised exception not containing a message. This adds that message from the original exception. I also checked that this was the only instance where a `QueryObjectValidationError` was not passing on a message, either a new one or the one from the original exception. We also add a test that would previously have failed due to the response being a 200 without the error message.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the 400 response of the incorrect request tells what the issue is:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/233009280-aa232b3a-0eb8-4c8c-baea-ee6562b2a189.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously the message was swallowed along with a 200 status

SUMMARY\r\nThe PR changes comment type for license headers in the Helm chart template files.\r\nThe PR does not change any functionality of the chart.\r\n\r\nAccording to [Comments (YAML Comments vs. Template Comments)](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/templates/#comments-yaml-comments-vs-template-comments):\r\n> YAML comments may be used when it is useful for Helm users to (possibly) see the comments during debugging\r\n\r\nSince there is no value in seeing license header during templates debug, it's a good idea to use Template comments instead of YAML comments for license headers.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n#### Before\r\n```shell\r\n$ helm template superset helm/superset\r\n---\r\n# Source: superset/templates/service.yaml\r\n#\r\n# Licensed

SUMMARY\r\nWhen copying SQL Lab results from the query history to the clipboard, the headers are not included in the payload. This PR adds the headers. While updating the tests I noticed that we were missing test cases for what the `columns` array actually looks like; it's usually `columns: { name: string }[]`, not `columns: string[]`. I therefore updated one of the tests to use the object-based `columns` array instead of the string-based one.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow when you copy this:\r\n<img width=\"885\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/232719283-ef009167-4ac6-4a8b-992e-bab757711113.png\">\r\n\r\nYou get this (the headers may appear to be off, but it's because they're tab separated, which isn't appropriately reflected in the code block):\r\n```\r\nds\tgender\tname\tnum\tstate\tnum_boys\tnum_girls\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tboy\tAaron\t369\tCA\t369\t0\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tgirl\tAmy\t494\tCA\t0\t494\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tgirl\tAndrea\t607\tCA\t0\t607\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tboy\tAndrew\t933\tCA\t933\t0\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tgirl\tAngela\t1066\tCA\t0\t1066\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tgirl\tAnna\t564\tCA\t0\t564\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tboy\tAnthony\t1928\tCA\t1928\t0\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tgirl\tBarbara\t922\tCA\t0\t922\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tboy\tBradley\t395\tCA\t395\t0\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tgirl\tBrenda\t961\tCA\t0\t961\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously you got this:\r\n```\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tboy\tAaron\t369\tCA\t369\t0\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tgirl\tAmy\t494\tCA\t0\t494\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tgirl\tAndrea\t607\tCA\t0\t607\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tboy\tAndrew\t933\tCA\t933\t0\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tgirl\tAngela\t1066\tCA\t0\t1066\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tgirl\tAnna\t564\tCA\t0\t564\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tboy\tAnthony\t1928\tCA\t1928\t0\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tgirl\tBarbara\t922\tCA\t0\t922\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tboy\tBradley\t395\tCA\t395\t0\r\n1965-01-01 00:00:00.000000\tgirl\tBrenda\t961\tCA\t0\t961\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nRedshift automatically [converts all text columns to a varchar(256)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_Character_types.html#r_Character_types-text-and-bpchar-types) which means for uploads, and in particular csv uploads for this case, the only way to upload a column with a large text field is to first create the table in sql lab with the correct column definitions and then upload to that existing table and replace the data. This pr adds a new dtype field for the upload, and using the \"string\" property, converts any field of this type to a varchar(max) for redshift. Currently all string types are uploaded as \"object\", so this change shouldn't impact any uploads that aren't explicitly passing the \"string\" property. We could extend this to other dbs, but it looks like the default behavior is for uploaded string columns to be converted to `text`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nAfter: (added a new field)\r\n![_DEV__Superset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5186919/232931480-42631450-1bab-4328-b7ca-8324c8c18f8a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this example, I updated just the column type to nvarchar(max) by passing `{\"Question\":\"string\"}` into the upload form. The other string field remains as varchar(256).\r\n![_DEV__Superset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5186919/232932193-59afc83b-555d-497d-aa38-da4a98b29c79.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThere might be times where after changing the dataset, the `translateToSql` is not just a string but an object and thus you get an error when trying to perform the substring operation. In that case we need to get the label from the `column_name` if present if not just return an empty string instead.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n![error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/232602461-2b3fef28-44a2-49a1-ac2d-01bed6bce8b3.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/232603574-d13dd959-27fb-4dad-87a1-ae1ab5229439.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Load a BigNumber chart\r\n2. Swap the dataset to be something that has a time filter like Vehicle Sales in the examples DB\r\n3. Change the chart type to be area chart\r\n4. You should not get an error, instead, the filters should be populated using the new dataset info\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR migrates the Pivot Table v1 chart to v2. In detail, it does the following:\r\n- Creates a processor for the Pivot Table chart to convert v1 `form_data` to v2\r\n- Augments the base `MigrateViz` class to support migrating generic chart axes related fields given that some legacy plugins only work without generic chart axes\r\n- Creates a database migration that invokes the processor\r\n- Creates a migration test\r\n- Removes the legacy Pivot Table code and unregisters the plugin.\r\n- Removes old plugin references throughout the codebase\r\n- Updates unit tests\r\n- Updates E2E tests\r\n- Updates the example dashboards\r\n- Updates translation files\r\n\r\nThe following table summarizes the differences in the `form_data` structure between the versions:\r\n\r\nv1 | v2 | Notes\r\n-- | -- | --\r\ncolumns | groupbyColumns | ¬†\r\ncombine_metric | combineMetric | ¬†\r\ngranularity_sqla | adhoc_filters.subject | Only if GENERIC_CHART_AXES is enabled\r\ngroupby | groupbyRows | ¬†\r\nnumber_format | valueFormat | ¬†\r\npandas_aggfunc | aggregateFunction | Values changed between versions\r\npivot_margins | rowTotals, colTotals | ¬†\r\nrow_limit | series_limit | ¬†\r\ntime_range | adhoc_filters.comparator | Only if GENERIC_CHART_AXES is enabled\r\ntimeseries_limit_metric | series_limit_metric | ¬†\r\ntranspose_pivot | transposePivot | ¬†\r\n\r\n\\* All other keys are the same or exist only in the target version\r\n\\* The time column type (simple or SQL) affects the `adhoc_filters` value\r\n\r\n### AFTER SCREENSHOT\r\n<img width=\"1065\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-19 at 10 24 26\"

converted to Pivot Table\r\n2 - Make sure Pivot Table (legacy) is not available anymore in the viz picker\r\n3 - Make sure that it's possible to revert the migration by executing `superset db downgrade` and reverting this PR\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [x] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [x] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [x] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [x] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-17T16:38:45Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T21:28:18Z","closed_at":"2023-06-08T13:13:39Z","merged_at":"2023-06-08T13:13:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"522eb97b65dcaceb82f7f1b7de8545997a415253","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eschutho","id":5186919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5186919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho","html_url":"https://github.com/eschutho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"geido","id":60598000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTk4MDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60598000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido","html_url":"https://github.com/geido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jinghua-qa","id":81597121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTk3MTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81597121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa","html_url":"https://github.com/jinghua-qa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1157173956,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTU3MTczOTU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/risk:breaking-change","name":"risk:breaking-change","color":"e67e22","default":false,"description":"Issues

SUMMARY\r\nAlternative solution of #23653\r\n\r\nWhen a schema contains a humorous table list, rendering cost of SqlEditorLeftBar is heavy since it requires to iterate millions items. To avoid the lag of using sql editor, we should avoid the LeftBar rendering while typing.\r\nThis commit fixes the `useSelector` in SqlEditor which triggers the re-rendering of SqlEditorLeftBar anytime redux action triggered.\r\n\r\nP.S. - Found the root cause from https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21320/files#diff-dac1ba995e65dfae7c9aa7a0a794036ace1eb83814e2101d354752da2bb41dfdR166

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nThe added unit tests would fail with the currently used approach.\r\n\r\nThe described cases include:\r\n  - multiple holidays per year (happens for Islamic calendar countries) e.g., \"Eid al-Fitr\" holidays for Saudi Arabia (JAN and DEC of 2000)\r\n  - multiple holidays per lookup name, e.g., \"Independence Day\" for US years after

SUMMARY\r\nIf you have an existing sqllab browser tab open and for whatever reason get disconnected from the vpn and issue a query, that query tab will forever be suck in a \"running/pending\" state and fail to stop.\r\nThe issue is that the query request never reaches the server; whereas, it is recorded in local storage.\r\nThis commit adds the clearInactiveQuery action to clean up the queries that never connected with the server and then batches the action on QueryAutoRefresh logic.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently it's only possible to assign series colors on dashboards based on the color names (e.g. \"red\") or hex codes (e.g. \"#FF0000\"). This tends to be impractical, as it's often only necessary to ensure that the colors stay constant across charts. In addition, assigning fixed hex colors will fail to change if color schemes are updated.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the option to assign colors based on the color scheme index. This ensures that the color will be fixed, but also makes it adapt to whichever color scheme is chosen. This is done by letting the `CategoricalColorScale` objects swap out the index based color reference of the `parentForcedColors` that's passed to it in the constructor (the `parentForcedColors` object is mutated by charts as series are populated, hence it's ok to make changes to the object here, too).\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOT\r\nHere we're using the \"D3 category 10\" scheme, and assign index 2 (=the third value) for \"boy\" and the fixed color \"red\" for \"girl\":\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/231413848-3b6f11c6-51d4-4bcd-a595-c615823f2ad7.png)\r\n\r\nAfter we do that, the charts update accordingly:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/231414101-3fbc6387-96bc-40fd-bec1-11b6da278872.png)\r\n\r\nIf we then change the scale to the \"ECharts 5.0\" scheme, the dashboard updates accordingly (notice \"boy\" turns yellow, which is the third color in that scheme, while \"girl\" stays unchanged):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/231414696-385589d3-0b92-464a-86db-88c1e05b6284.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/231414769-8ad42447-963f-4b47-8024-3ca045304285.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nRather than having a `normalize_indexes` method for normalizing the response of the DB-API `get_indexes` function, the DB engine spec should provide a more flexible utility method named `get_indexes`‚Äîakin to `get_table_names`, `get_column_names`, etc. with access to the database et al. objects and can be overridden. \r\n\r\nThe motivation for the change is at Airbnb for Trino we have both Iceberg and Hive backed tables where the Trino DB-API `get_indexes` method returns an empty list for Iceberg backed tables. Providing a `get_indexes` method within the DB engine spec allows us to easily add custom logic to handle both scenarios within our derived engine spec.\r\n \r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.
