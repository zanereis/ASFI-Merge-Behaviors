ended.\r\n\r\nThe changes to BucketRegionQueue are to not call super.basicDestroy if the queue doesn't contain the key.

removes old-I/O use in TCPConduit peer-to-peer communications.\r\nThis was used for SSL/TLS secure commuications but Java has had an\r\nSSLEngine implementation that allows you to implement secure\r\ncommunications on new-I/O SocketChannels or any other transport\r\nmechanism.\r\n\r\nA new NioSSLEngine class wraps the JDK's SSLEngine and provides the SSL\r\nhandshake as well as encryption/decryption of messages.  SocketCreator\r\nperforms the SSL handshake and returns a NioSslEngine that TCPConduit\r\nthen uses for messaging.\r\n\r\nThe SSL handshake needs to be done in Connection.java now because the\r\nByteBuffer used to do the handshake is also used for reading messages in\r\nReceivers.  Because of this the Handshake pool in TCPConduit became\r\nobsolete and I deleted it.\r\n\r\nI've also done a lot of cleanup of compilation warnings in\r\nConnection.java and removed references to \"NIO\".  The primary SSL/TLS\r\nchanges in that class are in writeFully (renamed from nioWriteFully)\r\nand processBuffer (renamed from processNIOBuffer).\r\n\r\nPorting client/server to use NioSSLEngine will be done under a separate\r\nticket and a different version of NioEngine may be created to secure\r\nUDP messaging.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `develop`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does `gradlew build` run cleanly?\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and\r\nsubmit an update to your PR as soon as possible.

PR consists of two commits. First commit refactors FunctionService so that it is unit testable. Second commit removes PowerMock from the ExecuteFunction unit tests.\r\n\r\nThe commit for GEODE-6171 does expose one new interface (FunctionExecutionService) just for consistency in how FunctionService and its internals are packaged but otherwise the changes are completely internal and the user doesn't see anything different. I'd like to eventually deprecate FunctionService and InternalFunctionService (the static APIs) and add some new API to returns an instance of FunctionExecutionService to the user. \r\n\r\nFunctionExecutionService is identical to FunctionService except the methods are non-static. We could move it to the internal package for now instead of leaving it in the user package.\r\n\r\nI recommend reviewing the changes fro the `Commits` tab instead of the `Files changed` tab.\r\n```\r\ncommit edf7d3c65892e0c3b05fdf25c4c2bfb1cd2bf23a (HEAD -> GEODE-6176-FunctionService-PowerMock, kirklund-fork/GEODE-6176-FunctionService-PowerMock)\r\nAuthor: Kirk Lund

interfaces with a traditional class to be instantiated:\r\n    * FunctionExecutionServiceImpl\r\n    \r\n    Collapse FunctionServiceManager into FunctionExecutionServiceImpl\r\n    \r\n    Change static API classes to delegate to private instance of\r\n    FunctionExecutionServiceImpl:\r\n    * FunctionService (User API) -- only has private internal changes\r\n    * InternalFunctionService -- now extends FunctionService\r\n    \r\n    This should allow unit tests to avoid using
