For example to get a optimal performance or it is necessary to get an certificate.\r\nTherefore admins needs a opportunity to add an volume to certain controller.\r\n\r\n**Implementation:**\r\nDecided to add a VolumeGroup class as an abstract object to manage this feature. \r\nA volume group is a triple of vm id, volume id and group number. \r\n\r\n-  group number == bus number\r\n-  groups are optional, user can work like before\r\n-  groups can only created via api\r\n-  during the attach the group will be create\r\n-  if vm have got mixed volumes with and without groups, \r\n   attach order is: root vol, vol with groups(order by disk seq), vols without groups(order by disk seq).\r\n- for import unmanaged VMs user have got three option:\r\n            1. **can do like before (no groups)** => import with current conf, after restart volumes \r\n                 will be attached on the first controller until max and then second controller and so on.\r\n                 (applied after restart)\r\n            2. **add vol groups to disk offering list** => add groups like user want it (applied after restart)\r\n            3. **set useControllerConfiguration = true** => read current controller conf of unmanaged vm \r\n                and add automatic volumegroups for each volume\r\n\r\n**SQL  for Update:**\r\n```\r\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS `cloud`.`volume_group`;\r\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `cloud`.`volume_group`(\r\n    `id` bigint unsigned PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT COMMENT 'Primary Key',\r\n    `vm_id` bigint unsigned NOT NULL COMMENT 'foreign key to vm table',\r\n    `volume_id` bigint unsigned NOT NULL COMMENT 'foreign key to volume table',\r\n    `group_number` int unsigned NOT NULL COMMENT 'group number of volume',\r\n    FOREIGN KEY(vm_id) REFERENCES vm_instance (id),\r\n    FOREIGN KEY(volume_id) REFERENCES volumes (id)\r\n);\r\n```\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document -->\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-21T08:35:25Z","updated_at":"2024-10-11T15:08:44Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073207,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMyMDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:vmware","name":"component:vmware","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":904051781,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MDQwNTE3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"a9b50e","default":false,"description":"Warning...

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a volume storage plugin for StorPool SDS\r\n\r\nThe main reason all classes are in one module is to provide maximum driver support even when the version is out of support. When installing the CloudsStack the StorPool's driver will come in a separate jar from the main uber jar. This allows us to provide fixes or enhancements before releases or out-of-support versions. It will only be necessary to override the old jar with the new one that carries the fix or the improvement. This decision has no effect or harm on the CloudStack project itself\r\n\r\nSupported operations:\r\n\r\ncreate/resize/delete volumes\r\ntake/revert/delete volume snapshots\r\ntake/revert/delete group snapshots - VM snapshots without the VM's memory\r\nmigrate Ceph/NFS/StorPool volumes to another StorPool primary storage\r\nVM live migration with storage - tested with volumes on NFS/Ceph/StorPool to another StorPool primary storage\r\ncreate a template from volume/snapshot\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to

All tests resulted in the expected behavior, as described in section [2.2](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/5935#2-proposed-changes--22-configuration-proposal) of the spec.\r\n- I tested the listVirtualMachinesMetrics API with different combinations of its new `accumulate` parameter with the global configuration `vm.stats.increment.metrics`, and everything worked as expected. See sections [2.2](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/5935#2-proposed-changes--22-configuration-proposal) and [3.3](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/5935#3-work-items--33-api) of the spec for more details.\r\n- I tested the UI modifications mentioned in section [3.4](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/5935#3-work-items--34-ui) of the spec. The obtained behavior was as follows:\r\n    - When clicking on the \"Metrics\" button only running VMs and their respective stats were listed;\r\n    - Then it was possible to \"force\" the listing of stopped VMs by changing the filter from \"All\" to \"Stopped\".\r\n- I tested the new listVirtualMachinesUsageHistory API by filtering by different time periods and VMs. All the filtering described in section [2.4](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/5935#2-proposed-changes--24-new-api-proposal) of the spec was successfully tested.","created_at":"2022-02-10T21:13:05Z","updated_at":"2022-07-12T04:09:13Z","closed_at":"2022-04-11T13:42:22Z","merged_at":"2022-04-11T13:42:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"16f2896940cb6ae5557a51b6b439bd71917e1781","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"borisstoyanov","id":13551960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTUxOTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13551960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov","html_url":"https://github.com/borisstoyanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843366,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:enhancement","name":"type:enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073134,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMxMzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:management-server","name":"component:management-server","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2238703193,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjM4NzAzMTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/status:needs-testing","name":"status:needs-testing","color":"fc2d98","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/21","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/21","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/21/labels","id":6943953,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjk0Mzk1Mw==","number":21,"title":"4.17.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":383,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-14T02:05:05Z","updated_at":"2022-06-06T14:02:44Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2022-06-06T14:02:44Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5984/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5984/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/5984/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/914ba7576a5eaaf7d5b7ac61dbc0e8271bd27fbc","head":{"label":"scclouds:persistence-of-vm-stats","ref":"persistence-of-vm-stats","sha":"914ba7576a5eaaf7d5b7ac61dbc0e8271bd27fbc","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_

Description\r\n\r\nWhen I was trying to upload volumes using CloudMonkey + cURL, the upload would always timeout and the SSVM would not receive the volume's data, even though it was receiving the HTTP headers. By adding this log line, it was possible to find out that cURL sends, by default, a 'Expect: 100-continue' with the HTTP request, and then wait the SSVM response, which never happens. Therefore, this PR proposes to add this log line in case any problems like that in the future happens, they would be more easily discovered by enabling the TRACE log level in the SSVM.\r\n\r\n###

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is a GSoC project: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/4814\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a feature to L2 persitent networks, where resources of the persistent networks are created at hostConnect phase of DefaultHostListener, and cleaned up at hostAboutToBeRemoved phase.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a bug, where rebooting the hosts removes the persistent network's resources, without readding them when the host is readded to the zone.\r\n\r\nContinuation of PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/5195\r\nFixes:

XenServer and VmWare setup on a local machine. \r\n\r\nDifferent manual test scenarios:\r\n1. When the persistent network is created and the host is added afterwards, the newly added host has the persistent network's resources.\r\n2. When a host within a zone with a persistent network is removed from the zone, its resources will be cleaned up.\r\n3. When a host with a running VM is removed from the zone, the running VM will migrate before the resources are cleaned up.\r\n4. When a host is rebooted, it still has access to the persistent network's resources.\r\n\r\nA Marvin component test under \r\ntest/integration/component/test_persistent_networks.py\r\nadded that tests the following steps for a KVM environment.\r\n1. identify hosts in the zone, and remove the first\r\n2. create a L2 persistent network\r\n3. add the host back to the zone\r\n\r\nValidation steps:\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue that the IPs are associated to wrong interfaces when reboot a VR on vmware/xen environment.\r\nHowever, VR will be broken if it is rebooted in vCenter or XenCenter (not in cloudstack).\r\n\r\nsteps to reproduce the issue\r\n(1) create vpc, and a vpc tier\r\n(2) acquire an ip in additional ip range, enable static nat or pf/lb\r\n(3) stop VR in cloudstack, start it in vCenter; OR restart VR in vCenter\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to

Description\r\n\r\nHello! \r\n\r\nI wanted to use dark red as the `@primary-color`, but after I'd set it, some elements turned grayish-red, which wasn't suitable for me. I decided to introduce some new optional variables for `config.json`.\r\n \r\nThis PR adds features that allow users to stylize:\r\n-  selected menu item & hovered table rows via `@primary-color-light`, \r\n-  gauges on Root-domain admin dashboard via `@dashboard-graph-`,\r\n-  tiles on custom-domain admin dashboard via `@dashboard-tile-`.\r\n\r\nIntroduced all new variables in the `ui/docs/customize.md`.\r\n\r\nTested it with and without the variables set.\r\n\r\nFocused on unchanging the default behavior (color palettes), so that default bg-colors will be the same as before.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-02-04

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the UI component of dynamically scale of KVM VMs partially implemented in the [PR](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/5703). The component Scale VM was showing all compute offering, which would lead the users to trial and error processes. Therefore, we changed it to display only the current compute offer for KVM VMs when the VM is running. If the VM is running and has a fixed offering, then it is displayed an error message. Furthermore, when a compute offering has a CPU Speed field, it defaults to the current speed of the VM offer, as oppose to zero, which is the current default behavior.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42067040/151982251-9f90aa57-5095-4534-9ccb-63f80cedb755.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis was tested in a local lab with VMs using KVM.\r\nVM1:\r\nFixed offering\r\n\r\nVM2:\r\nCustom offering\r\n\r\nWhile VM1 was running, the scale displayed the error message. When it was in the stopped state, the scale showed all available compute offerings.\r\n\r\nWhile VM2 was running, the scale only showed the current compute offering, and it shows the current CPU Speed. When it was in the stopped state, the scale showed all available

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the UI component of dynamically scale of KVM VMs partially implemented in the [PR](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/5703). The component Scale VM was showing all compute offering, which would lead the users to trial and error processes. Therefore, we changed it to display only the current compute offer for KVM VMs when the VM is running. If the VM is running and has a fixed offering, then it is displayed an error message. Furthermore, when a compute offering has a CPU Speed field, it defaults to the current speed of the VM offer, as oppose to zero, which is the current default behavior.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42067040/151982251-9f90aa57-5095-4534-9ccb-63f80cedb755.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis was tested in a local lab with VMs using KVM.\r\nVM1:\r\nFixed offering\r\n\r\nVM2:\r\nCustom offering\r\n\r\nWhile VM1 was running, the scale displayed the error message.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #5716 where isolated network VR failed to deploy when Vmxnet3 adapter type is used and when router.extra.public.nics is not 0. This is because of the extra nics that are reserved in the VR based on the global setting router.extra.public.nics.\r\n\r\nTo address the issue we have now implemented nic hot plugging for isolated networks because systemvm templates had open-vm-tools installed and support hot plugging which is what is already used in the case of VPC VR.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Set the global setting vmware.systemvm.nic.device.type to Vmxnet3 and router.extra.public.nics to some value (not 0)\r\n2. Create an isolated network and VM in it.\r\n3. VR will stuck in starting state\r\n\r\nAfter the fix, following are the test cases that are performed\r\n1. Set the global setting vmware.systemvm.nic.device.type to Vmxnet3. router.extra.public.nics is not used in VMware anymore.\r\n2. Create an isolated network N1 and VM in it\r\n3. Add a new IP range with different vlan under \"Physical Network Guest Public\".\r\n4. Aquire an IP from the above range in the network N1\r\n5. Enable staticnat on that IP\r\n6.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR solves issue #5891.\r\n\r\nThe main focus of this PR is to provide a flexible manner for operators to charge and bill their cloud resources. Issue #5891 has more details and flowcharts of all the mapped and affected/changed workflows.\r\n\r\nThe UI compatibility was not addressed in this PR. However, it's mapped to be the next steps.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI added unit tests to several methods, tested the whole CRUD, and the usage calculation.\r\n\r\nTo test the usage calculation I created some activation rules based on the cases described in issue #5891 (doing minor changes, such as changing the UUID to be validated). Then, I manually calculated the results and verified if the output is the same as I obtained in

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR address the `UriUtilsParametrizedTest` need for Internet connection. The unit tests of the class `UriUtilsParametrizedTest` will fail when they are executed without a connection to the Internet. That happens because of the method `getByName` from `InetAdress` class (that, given the host's name, determines its IP address). Therefore, if one executes the build in a network that does not allow Internet access, or if some DNS configuration is not resolving the configure DNS name in the tests, the tests fail. The goal of the test in that class is not to test DNS, but the validation of the accepted formats. Therefore, we should not depend on DNS, Internet connection, and others.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to solve that problem by mocking the object for the `InetAdress` class. That way, when the `getByName` method is called, the mocked object is returned and the tests can proceed normally without needing a healthy and working DNS or Internet connection to use some Internet DNS system. \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI ran the unit tests from the `UriUtilsParametrizedTest` class, before this PR, and without an Internet connection, the tests failed. Afterwards, I ran the tests again (with this PR), without an Internet connection, and they all passed as expected.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen assigning a VM to a Backup Offering, the information of the VM being attached to a Backup Offering is being saved in the DB before performing the assignment operation in Veeam.

fixed.","created_at":"2022-01-26T22:22:51Z","updated_at":"2022-02-18T18:05:30Z","closed_at":"2022-02-18T18:05:30Z","merged_at":"2022-02-18T18:05:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"50955432d41c91ca0c9be7330f46f03b624d33ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3036072822,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDM2MDcyODIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:backup","name":"component:backup","color":"30F036","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/21","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/21","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/21/labels","id":6943953,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjk0Mzk1Mw==","number":21,"title":"4.17.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":383,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-14T02:05:05Z","updated_at":"2022-06-06T14:02:44Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2022-06-06T14:02:44Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5903/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5903/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/5903/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/9f2f220832ceb4b047503b85df1d9cc9c917e639","head":{"label":"scclouds:change-vm-aassign-flow-logic-in-backup-offering","ref":"change-vm-aassign-flow-logic-in-backup-offering","sha":"9f2f220832ceb4b047503b85df1d9cc9c917e639","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nThe default behavior of ACS is to try to use all available public IPs, including those reserved for system VMs; by default when a public IP is reserved to System VM, they are used as preferred to be allocated to system VMs, but not restricted to these type of VMs. This behavior can be changed by changing the value of the global setting `system.vm.public.ip.reservation.mode.strictness` from false to true. However, if an IP reserved for system VMs is already in use for a user VR, the parameter change will make the IP to be hidden from the user, which can lead to all sorts of confusion. Therefore, this PR is intended to address these situations.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested in a local lab:\r\n1. I allocated a range of 10 IPs to System VMs with `system.vm.public.ip.reservation.mode.strictness` as false;\r\n2. I allocated all the other IPs to another network;\r\n3. I created a new network and started a new VM with this network;\r\n4. Then I changed the `system.vm.public.ip.reservation.mode.strictness` to true;\r\n5.

Description\r\n\r\nThe 'platform' setting is retrieved after a VM is stopped with the platform parameters obtained from Xen/XCP for a certain VM. If a user added the setting 'cpu.corespersocket', it was ignored and the setting was never applied as it was mutually exclusive with the platform 'setting'.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the previous behavior, in the following way:\r\n- If 'cpu.corespersocket'=X AND the 'platform' setting does not contain 'cores-per-socket' -> 'cores-per-socket:X' parameter is added to the 'platform' setting which is sent to Xen/XCP\r\n- If 'cpu.corespersocket'=X AND the 'platform' setting contains 'cores-per-socket:Y' -> The 'platform' setting is updated, containing: 'cores-per-socket:X'\r\n- If 'cpu.corespersocket' is not set, nothing changes\r\n\r\nFixes: #5695 \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature

using an offering with 2 CPUs (use >=2 CPUs for tests)\r\n- Stop VM -> Settings -> Check the 'platform' setting is visible and does not contain the 'cores-per-socket' parameter\r\n- Add the setting

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes issues on mounting secondary storage from XCP hosts, controlling the NFS version set.\r\n\r\n- The NFS version is set at the `secstorage.nfs.version` setting of an image store, or if it is not set, the global value is used\r\n- Mount commands will append the NFS version to the mount options, for example: `mount -o vers=4....`\r\n- Each time the value is changed, the management server has to be restarted for the NFS version to take effect\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTested on a NFS 3 server as image store\r\n- Deploy the environment\r\n- Set image store 'secstorage.nfs.version' = 4\r\n- Restart the management server\r\n\r\n- Deploy VM -->

Description\r\nWhen deleting a domain, the UI shows an error, but successfully deletes the domain. This happens because the UI does not refresh the domain list and requests the deleted domain's information, thus ACS would return an error. This was partially fixed on PR #5710, but the changes were insufficient.\r\n\r\nIn case there is only 2 domains, for example: 'ROOT' and 'A', when deleting 'A' the UI does not show the previous error, but it still shows the deleted domain's information. The proposed solution to this problem is to force the UI to refresh the component that shows the domain information. Therefore, this PR is intended to introduce these changes.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ]

have only the ROOT and any other domain;\r\n - Delete the domain;\r\n - The ROOT information should be shown, and the ROOT should be selected.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-20T14:00:10Z","updated_at":"2022-02-11T19:45:17Z","closed_at":"2022-02-11T19:45:17Z","merged_at":"2022-02-11T19:45:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"7aa9d3cd51fa1f3974af79a470f08612c4498cf7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"shwstppr","id":153340,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzM0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr","html_url":"https://github.com/shwstppr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/21","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/21","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/21/labels","id":6943953,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjk0Mzk1Mw==","number":21,"title":"4.17.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":383,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-14T02:05:05Z","updated_at":"2022-06-06T14:02:44Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2022-06-06T14:02:44Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5882/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5882/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/5882/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/0d3f252ff04bd94c6ea50e5bfb5f91d8c8794aaa","head":{"label":"scclouds:Fix-delete-domain-error","ref":"Fix-delete-domain-error","sha":"0d3f252ff04bd94c6ea50e5bfb5f91d8c8794aaa","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","

Description\r\n\r\nWhen configuring domain resource limits in the UI, writing a value (but not saving) into the input field and then selecting another domain would make the value written in the previous domain resource limits tab appear for the newly selected domain as well. This bug can cause the user to unintentionally change values in the wrong domain, for example:\r\nSetting the \"Max. Memory\" field in domain A, switching to domain B, setting the \"Max. User Vms\" field, and then clicking submit would cause both fields to be submitted for domain B.\r\n\r\nThe proposed change is to reset the fields after calling the API's `listResourceLimits`.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds

Description\r\n\r\nWhen creating a new firewall egress rule, the source and destination CIDRs are considered invalid if they begin or end with a white space, which might happen if the user copy and pastes the CIDRs from somewhere else. This PR aims to remove/clean white spaces from CIDRs, thus making the user experience more fluid. The proposed change is to trim the CIDRs before checking if they are valid.\r\nI extracted the CIDR validation method and also created unit tests for it.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [X] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n- New unit tests were created to test the behavior of the new method.\r\n- It was also tested in a local lab, by creating new firewall egress rules and inputting source and destination CIDRs with leading or ending with whitespaces.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-14T14:36:50Z","updated_at":"2022-02-11T17:06:02Z","closed_at":"2022-02-11T17:06:01Z","merged_at":"2022-02-11T17:06:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"2d8f070ea4a2c0ab396c581a7de34dc03c2c507e","assignee":{"login":"JoaoJandre","id":48719461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzE5NDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48719461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre","html_url":"https://github.com/JoaoJandre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"JoaoJandre","id":48719461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzE5NDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48719461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre","html_url":"https://github.com/JoaoJandre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoaoJandre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843364,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:bug","name":"type:bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":""},{"id":592559219,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTI1NTkyMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:networking","name":"component:networking","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/21","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/21","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/21/labels","id":6943953,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjk0Mzk1Mw==","number":21,"title":"4.17.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":383,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-14T02:05:05Z","updated_at":"2022-06-06T14:02:44Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2022-06-06T14:02:44Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5867/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5867/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/5867/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/6ddebc4909b64d8a7bc1d2969ea012b9f099bc31","head":{"label":"scclouds:source-and-destination-CIDR-trimming","ref":"source-and-destination-CIDR-trimming","sha":"6ddebc4909b64d8a7bc1d2969ea012b9f099bc31","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the features to provide high availability using Ceph RBD-based Primary Storage.\r\n\r\nThe KVM Host HA feature uses NFS Primary Storage. However, an additional storage consideration in KVM is Ceph RBD. This PR considers the following two to provide HA using RBD.\r\n\r\n1. Must use the multi-monitor server feature of Ceph RBD.\r\n2. The RBD-based HA function should be provided in the same way as the NFS-based HA.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the feature to enter multiple monitor addresses separated by commas in the RADOS Monitor item when registering RBD Primary Storage.\r\n\r\nAnd it includes adding code to provide HA based on RBD Primary Storage.\r\n\r\nTo support RBD-based HA, add RBDStoragePool class to KVMHABase and use it to perform heartbeat check and activity check in the same way as NFS. Similar to how NFS writes hb and ac files to a KVMHA directory, RADOS commands are used to put hb and ac files into the RBD pool registered as primary storage.\r\n\r\nTo perform this heartbeat and activity check, kvmheartbeat_rbd.sh and kvmvmactivity_rbd.sh files were added. This is to clearly distinguish roles from the same shell file for nfs.\r\n\r\nThis PR is necessary to support agent-free HA based on Ceph RBD like NFS, even if the related PR #4978 is merged.\r\n\r\nThe execution result of the function can be checked in the attached image.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL -
