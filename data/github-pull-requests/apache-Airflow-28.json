Goal\r\n\r\nSet-up authentication using JWT token in UI API. The UI API should be protected hy authentication using JWT token. This PR creates the logic behind JWT token authentication.\r\n\r\n## What is done?\r\n\r\n- Authentication logic using JWT token\r\n\r\n## What has been done but is not in this PR?\r\n\r\n- Authentication done for the 2 endpoints in `airflow/api_fastapi/views/public/dags.py`. I am aware this is the public API and not the UI API but this is just for testing.\r\n- Manual testing using these 2 endpoints\r\n\r\nThe reason why I did not include these changes in the PR is we need first the UI to pass down the token to the API. Otherwise all APIs will fail. I'll create follow-up PRs once the new UI handle the token.\r\n\r\n## What is not done?\r\n\r\nThe actual JWT auth-backend. This can be done in a separate PR once this one is merged so for the sake of keeping a PR as small as possible, I'll do it in a separate PR\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

tracks asset orphaning like the old is_orphaned flag (but in the other direction, as the name suggests). The difference is that this table also serves as a unique constraint on both the name and URI used by the user is unique across a DAG deployment. This is different from the unique constraint on Asset, which only ensures the name-URI combination is unique.\r\n\r\nI also took the chance to also change AssetAlias’s `name` length limit to 1500 to match Asset’s.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/42581\r\n### Problem Description\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acd6da8b-c1d8-4ac1-b1e2-4899195f1c78)\r\nThe trigger_rule of `task_one_success` is `one_success`. When the upstream node of `task_one_success` has not yet run, `task_one_success` is skipped. According to the semantics of `one_success`, `task_one_success` should be able to run.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, Airflow turns on the `schedule_after_task_execution` parameter, which means that after the upstream node finishes running, it will try to schedule the downstream node in the current worker.\r\n\r\nThis problem may occur when `task_1` runs faster than `task_run`. More specifically, it occurs when `task_1` finishes running and successfully schedules downstream tasks in the current worker.\r\n\r\n### Related Code\r\nBelow is the code in question\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07adfa4f-ce38-4e37-ac02-42a000fb107c)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a9bc36c-f431-4650-821e-044a471c713a)\r\nWhen `task_1` is finished, it will try to schedule downstream tasks. First, a partial dag will be generated.\r\n```python\r\npartial_dag = task.dag.partial_subset(\r\n                task.downstream_task_ids,\r\n                include_downstream=True,\r\n                include_upstream=False,\r\n                include_direct_upstream=True,\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n`task => \"task_1\"`\r\n`task.downstream_task_ids => \"task_2\"`\r\n\r\n`include_downstream=True => [\"task_2\"]`\r\n`include_upstream=False => [\"task_2\"]`\r\n`include_direct_upstream=True => [\"task_2\", \"task_skip\", \"task_one_success\", \"task_1\"]`\r\n\r\nSo the final `partial_dag` is `[\"task_2\", \"task_skip\", \"task_one_success\", \"task_1\"]`\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73f2bc6a-d790-4a29-9256-a70c8968f30b)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/789cedfb-8d62-420d-b74b-3deedaf4ea30)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis partial_dag is incomplete because `task_one_success`'s other upstream node `task_run` is not in it.Specifically, the `include_upstream` parameter should not be false\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nThe correct subgraph division should be as follows, `include_upstream=True`:\r\n```python\r\npartial_dag = task.dag.partial_subset(\r\n                task.downstream_task_ids,\r\n                include_downstream=True,\r\n                include_upstream=True,\r\n                include_direct_upstream=True,\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n`task => \"task_1\"`\r\n`task.downstream_task_ids => \"task_2\"`\r\n\r\n`include_downstream=True => [\"task_2\"]`\r\n`include_upstream=True =>[\"task_2\", \"task_skip\", \"task_one_success\", \"task_1\", \"task_run\", \"branch\"]`\r\n`include_direct_upstream=True => [\"task_2\", \"task_skip\", \"task_one_success\", \"task_1\", \"task_run\", \"branch\"]`\r\n\r\nSo the final partial_dag is `[\"task_2\", \"task_skip\", \"task_one_success\", \"task_1\", \"task_run\", \"branch\"]`\r\n\r\nThe final partial_dag should be as follows:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7832ea16-2eeb-4e0c-bcb2-9b1b84a7ac7b)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5092f9f4-9093-43de-98d8-c6980fef2757)\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgraph pruning will only be performed when the `schedule_after_task_execution` parameter is turned on. Normal scheduler scheduling will not have this problem.","created_at":"2024-09-30T12:32:23Z","updated_at":"2025-01-10T07:30:22Z","closed_at":"2024-10-23T08:35:24Z","merged_at":"2024-10-23T08:35:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"3fceaa69260be80bc2123cd4664db79d96142b9f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

Summary of Changes\r\nCloses: #40966 by updating the `EmrCreateJobFlowOperator` logic to ensure that the deferral trigger is activated only when `wait_for_completion` is set to `True`. Previously, the deferral trigger was applied regardless of the `wait_for_completion` setting, causing unintended behavior.\r\n\r\n# Changes Made:\r\n- **Modified `EmrCreateJobFlowOperator` logic:**\r\n  - Now checks both `deferrable` and `wait_for_completion` flags before activating the deferral trigger.\r\n  \r\n- **Added a new unit test case `TestEmrCreateJobFlowOperatorExtended`:**\r\n  - Verifies the new logic where the deferral trigger is only set when both `deferrable` and `wait_for_completion` are `True`.\r\n  - Confirms the `defer`

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

Of course I don't know if this is a good name, but I'll explain what I wanted to achieve within Airflow 2.x.\r\n\r\nAt our company we have some DAG's that have to process a lot of paged results, which are returned as indexed XCom's.\r\nIf those indexed XCom's aren't that many, it's easily possible to process those using the MappedOperator with the partial and expand functionality.  But once you have like more than 1k indexed XComs, processing those becomes very hard (unless maybe you have a beefy Postgres database behind it due to the high number of dynamic task being created).\r\n\r\nWe are using the KubernetesExecutor, which means that each taskinstance runs on a dedicated worker, and of course you can use parallelism to process multiple tasks at once, but when there are too many dynamic tasks for one operator, this become's more a problem than a solution.   Processing is actually slower and the UI has also trouble monitoring all those dynamic tasks (see screenshot which shows difference in execution time between expand and iterate).  As you can see, the difference in performance is huge when you compare the expand vs iterate solution.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79cee79e-6d33-47e2-a790-f68954183d33)\r\n\r\nSo to bypass those issues, I've thought of an operator which instead of expanding all mapped arguments, \"streams\" them. \r\nThe reason why I call it stream (and implemented it as a IterableOperator) is because I inspired this solution from the Java 8 stream API, which allows you to process a list or an iterable in a lazy way, and if wanted, apply parallelism to it.  Here of course it's not completely the same, but the idea behind it is.  The advantage of this is that for Airflow, all mapped arguments which are translated to multiple task instances, are actually processed as one within one operator, the IterableOperatorthat is.\r\nYou could see this solution as some kind of a conccurent for loop within an operator for mapped parameters.\r\n\r\nBut as opposed to the MappedOperator, the IterableOperatorwill execute the partial operator within the same operator and task instance using asynchronous code and a semaphore, the later one is being used to limit to number of threads being used simultaneously.  This can be done by specifying the 'max_active_tis_per_dag' parameter, but if not specified it will use the number of cpu's available withing that worker.  If you don't want parallelism, you can set it to 1 so that each task gets executed sequentially. Sometimes this can be handy if you don't want to \"DDOS\" a REST endpoint and so avoid being throttled.  I a tasks fail, it will use the do same as with dynamic tasks mapping an retry it until it's number of retries are exceeded.  Also the retry_delay will work the same way, of course only failed tasks will be retried.  You will notice that most of the code is actually re-used code from Airflow, except the async part execution and the complete evaluation of all values in the ExpandInput instance is new code.\r\n\r\nAlso async operators, which use a trigger, will be executed that way, so all processing happens asynchronously within the same operator and thus task instance and thus worker.  Of course this can be perceived a bit as hackish code to achieve this way of working within Airflow, but this allowed me to easily patch our own Airflow installation and allowed me to \"easily\" add this functionality.  This functionality could also be implemented as an alternative strategy within the expand method using a parameter to decide which one to use, still I personally found a dedicated stream method more elegant.\r\n\r\nOf course the code could still use some refactoring, but I tried to implement it as clean as possible.  This is still a draft, so I still need to add some unit tests, which shouldn't be that big of a challenge. It would also be a solution of the question asked [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/26093) without the need of custom code.\r\n\r\nHere a simple example of a DAG using the iterate functionality:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    \"streamed_operator_performance_test\",\r\n    default_args=DEFAULT_ARGS,\r\n    schedule_interval=timedelta(hours=24),\r\n    max_active_runs=5,\r\n    concurrency=5,\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n) as dag:\r\n    distinct_users_ids_task = SQLExecuteQueryOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"distinct_users_ids\",\r\n        conn_id=\"odbc_dev\",\r\n        sql=\"SELECT TOP 1000 ID FROM USERS\",\r\n        dag=dag,\r\n    )\r\n \r\n    user_registered_devices_task = MSGraphAsyncOperator.partial(\r\n        task_id=\"user_registered_devices\",\r\n        conn_id=\"msgraph_api\",\r\n        url=\"users/{userId}/registeredDevices\",\r\n        retry_delay=60,\r\n        dag=dag,\r\n    ).iterate(path_parameters=distinct_users_ids_task.output.map(lambda u: {\"userId\": u[0]}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

This change simply lowers the saturation and contrast to soften the overall appearance, potentially reducing eyestrain for people with eyes that are sensitive to such high contrast.\r\n\r\nAdjusting the contrast also emphasizes the styling between alternating rows in the DAG list. \r\n\r\nOpen to suggestions to better tweak it for a broader audience.

#42502\r\n \r\nThe Kafka ConsumeFromTopicOperator and ProduceToTopicOperator are failing to resolve callable template fields. For a callable to work with template functions, it must accept both the context and jinja_env.\r\n\r\nIf we include `producer_function` and `apply_function` in the template fields, all current users will need to modify their scripts to accept both `context` and `jinja_env`. and some minor updates require in kafka operator.\r\n\r\nI also tested another scenario where the function does accept context and jinja_env, but in the UI template field, it appears as a generated type object(please check below screenshot). Since there isn’t much value in displaying this field as a generated type object, I believe it's better to remove these from the template fields altogether.\r\n\r\nAny other suggestion please?\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1345\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c957818c-81e7-4d56-bbbc-303270287b4a\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRemoved the fields and executed kafka system test.\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d593b8f-9b1f-4557-8130-8f7d7edd9754)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Since we want to get rid of FAB, we need to make these tests agnostic from FAB. In this PR, they are now using simple auth manager.\r\n\r\nI did two things:\r\n- Any test that do not need granular permissions, keep them in `tests/api_connexion/endpoints/` and make them agnostic from FAB\r\n- Any test using granular permissions, move them to FAB provider\r\n\r\nThis PR is quite big but I could not find a way to make it smaller. Here are some tips for a quicker review:\r\n- Code change in `tests/api_connexion/endpoints/` is removing tests that use granular permissions\r\n- Code change in `tests/providers/fab/auth_manager/api_endpoints/` is tests being copy pasted from `tests/api_connexion/endpoints/` that use granular permissions (the ones that are removed in the previous step)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

serialized DAG dictionary is not ordered correctly when creating hashes, and that causes inconsistent hashes, leading to\r\nfrequent update of the serialized DAG table.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\nImplemented sorting for serialized DAG dictionaries and nested structures to ensure consistent and predictable serialization order for hashing. Using `sort_keys` in `json.dumps` is not enough to sort the nested structures in the serialized DAG.\r\n\r\nAdded serialize and deserialize methods for DagParam and ArgNotSet to allow for more structured serialization.\r\n\r\nUpdated serialize_template_field to handle objects that implement the serialize method.
