#5510, I added an unsafe (but probably fine in practice) equals/hashCode to the Windows hierarchy.\r\n\r\nI believe that this approach is better since:\r\n* It includes no non-deprecated mutable state in equals/hashCode\r\n* It avoids the subclass-return-type builder issues\r\n* It restricts the public interface to only the things that need to be known about all Windows. That is, all Windows need to offer a `gracePeriodMs()`. They do *not* all need to offer a builder method to set it. See `UnlimitedWindows`, for which \"grace period\" is nonsense. It does not need to allow setting it, and it can return `0`, which is always correct. In contrast, consider `UnlimitedWindows#until(long)`, which has to throw a runtime exception because the interface unnecessarily requires this method to be implemented.\r\n\r\nIn general, this PR sets a direction in which, once we drop the deprecated members from `Windows`, all the members will be abstract, and `Windows` itself will basically be an interface, which offers a much cleaner and more consistent implementation target.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

patch fixes two issues:\r\n\r\n1) Currently if a broker received StopReplicaRequest with delete=true for the same offline replica, the first StopRelicaRequest will show KafkaStorageException and the second StopRelicaRequest will show ReplicaNotAvailableException. This is because the first StopRelicaRequest will remove the mapping (tp -> ReplicaManager.OfflinePartition) from ReplicaManager.allPartitions before returning KafkaStorageException, thus the second StopRelicaRequest will not find this partition as offline.\r\n\r\nThis result appears to be inconsistent. And since the replica is already offline and broker will not be able to delete file for this replica, the StopReplicaRequest should fail without making any change and broker should still remember that this replica is offline. \r\n\r\n2) Currently if broker receives StopReplicaRequest with delete=true, the broker will attempt to remove future replica for the partition, which will cause KafkaStorageException in the StopReplicaResponse if this replica does not have future replica. It is problematic to always return KafkaStorageException in the response if future replica does not exist.","created_at":"2018-08-20T07:06:26Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T02:46:20Z","closed_at":"2018-11-06T19:43:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"87fea7c8b7a032f9729f61514152fcb03fb5e942","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5533/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5533/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5533/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/d30ed3ceb06247062d7776864f632a1326fbdfdc","head":{"label":"lindong28:KAFKA-7313","ref":"KAFKA-7313","sha":"d30ed3ceb06247062d7776864f632a1326fbdfdc","user":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21054638,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTA1NDYzOA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"lindong28/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28/kafka","description":"Mirror

never resets the next batch expiry time. Its always computed as the min of the current value and the expiry time for all batches being processed. This means that its always set to the expiry time of the first batch, and once that time has passed Sender starts spinning on epoll with a timeout of 0, which consumes a lot of CPU. This patch updates Sender to reset the next batch expiry time on each poll loop so that a new value reflecting the expiry time for the current set of batches is computed.\r\n\r\ncc @guozhangwang

Key Join:\r\n================================\r\nAllows for a KTable to map its value to a given foreign key and join on another KTable keyed on that foreign key. Applies the joiner, then returns the tuples keyed on the original key. This supports updates from both sides of the join.\r\n\r\nDesign Philosophy:\r\n================================\r\nThe intent of this design was to build a totally encapsulated function that operates very similarly to the regular join function. No further work is required by the user to obtain their foreignKeyJoin results after calling the function. That being said, there is increased cost in some of the topology components, especially due to resolving out-of-order arrival due to foreign key changes. I would appreciate any and all feedback on this approach, as my understanding of the Kafka Streams DSL is to provide higher level functionality without requiring the users to know exactly what's going on under the hood. \r\n\r\nSome points of note:\r\n1) Requires an additional materialized State Store for the prefixScanning of the repartitioned CombinedKey events.\r\n\r\n2) ReadOnlyKeyValueStore interface was modified to contain prefixScan. This requires that all implementations support this, but follows an existing precedent where some store functions are already stubbed out with exceptions.\r\n\r\n3) Currently limited to Inner Join (can do more join logic in future - just limiting the focus of this KIP).\r\n\r\n4) Application Reset does not seem to delete the new internal topics that I have added. (only tested with Kafka 1.0).\r\n\r\n5) Only works with identical number of input partitions at the moment, though it may be possible to get it working with KTables of varying input partition count.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n================================\r\nTesting is covered by a two integration tests that exercises the foreign key join. \r\nThe first test exercises the out-of-order resolution and partitioning strategies by running three streams instances on three partitions. This demonstrates the scalability of the proposed solution.\r\n\r\n*important* The second test (KTableKTableForeignKeyInnerJoinMultiIntegrationTest) attempts to join using foreign key twice. This results in a NullPointerException regarding a missing task, and must be resolved before committing this.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-17T18:27:07Z","updated_at":"2020-06-12T23:59:17Z","closed_at":"2019-10-03T22:59:32Z","merged_at":"2019-10-03T22:59:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"c87fe9402cbebc460b42cd3dd7c268e5e6e659d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null},{"id":2129035451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTI5MDM1NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kip","name":"kip","color":"a01d16","default":false,"description":"Requires

Add `keySerde` and `valSerde` in the `AbstractStream`, which are null-able.\r\n2. For all classes extending `AbstractStream`, including `KStream/KTable/KGroupedStream/KGroupedTable/TimeWindowedKStream/SessionWindowedKStream`-impl classes, try to pass the serdes specified from `Materialized / Serialized / Joined` to children nodes. Note here I've only done the forward-inheritance, but not backward-inheritance, which is left for future works (thinking about this, only `Produced / Serialized` serdes are worth passing backwards to parent nodes, so the scope of it may not be too large).\r\n3. Removed a bunch of unchecked annotations to strengthen the typing system.\r\n4.

controller failover and broker changes, it sends out UpdateMetadataRequest to all brokers in the cluster containing the states for all partitions and live brokers. The current implementation will instantiate the UpdateMetadataRequest object and its serialized form (Struct) for `# of brokers` times, which causes OOM if the memory exceeds the configure JVM heap size before GC kicks in. We have seen this issue in the production environment for multiple times. \r\n\r\nFor example, if we have 100 brokers in the cluster and each broker is the leader of 2k partitions, the extra memory usage introduced by controller trying to send out UpdateMetadataRequest is around:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<memory used by UpdateMetadataRequest Structs> * <# of brokers> * <total # of leader parittions>\r\n= 250B * 100 * 200k = 5GB\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR avoids the recreation of UpdateMetadataReuqest and struct objects if the same builder object is used to build the request. This can significantly reduce memory footprint in Controller based on the above calculation.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

the only producer state left in the log is a transaction marker, then we do not know the next expected sequence number. This can happen if there is a call to DeleteRecords which arrives prior to the writing of the marker. Currently we raise an OutOfOrderSequence error when this happens, but this is treated as a fatal error by the producer. Raising UnknownProducerId instead allows the producer to check for truncation using the last acknowledged sequence number and reset if possible.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

in the Scala streams API is currently unusable in `2.0.0` as reported by @mowczare:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/5019#issuecomment-412632207\r\n\r\nThis due to an overload of it with the same signature in the first curried parameter.\r\nSee compiler issue that didn't catch it: https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-2628\r\n\r\nI don't see many options here:\r\n- Keeping only one `join` with the `Materialized` as implicit like we did with `aggregate`... (this PR currently implements)\r\n- Renaming the materialized `join` to something like `joinMat`.\r\n- Uncurrying one of the 2 or both `join` and loosing the type inference.\r\n\r\nI will add all the needed tests once we agree on an option.\r\n\r\nThe current workarounds are:\r\n- Monkey patching KTable.scala in your code with the implementation in this PR.\r\n- Rolling back to

the KIP-263 discussion, we think we can improve broker restart time by avoiding performing costly disk operations when sanity checking index files for segments below recovery point on broker startup.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the following changes:\r\n1. Mmap the index file and populate fields of the index file on-demand rather than performing costly disk operations when creating the index object on broker startup.\r\n2. Skip sanity checks on the time index and offset index of segments.\r\n   1) For segment with offset below the flushed point (recovery point), these segments are safely flushed so we don't need to sanity check the index files. if there are indeed data corruption on disk, given that we don't sanity check the segment file, sanity checking only the indexes adds little benefit.\r\n   2) For segment with offset above the flushed point (recovery point), we will recover these segments in `recoveryLog()` (Log.scala) in any case so sanity checking the index files for these segments is redundant.\r\n\r\nWe did experiments on a cluster with 15 brokers, each of which has ~3k segments (and there are 31.8k partitions with RF=3 which are evenly distributed across brokers; total bytes-in-rate is around 400 MBps). The results show that rolling bounce time reduces from 135 minutes to 55 minutes.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

As titled, add a `rewriteTopology` that 1) sets application id, 2) maybe disable caching, 3) adjust for source KTable. This optimization can hence be applied for both DSL or PAPI generated Topology.\r\n\r\n2. Defer the building of globalStateStores in `rewriteTopology` so that we can also disable caching. But we still need to build the state stores before `InternalTopologyBuilder.build()` since we should only build global stores once for all threads.\r\n\r\n3. Added withCachingDisabled to StoreBuilder, it is a public API change.\r\n\r\n4. [Optional] Fixed unit test config setting functionalities, and set the necessary config to shorten the unit test latency (now it reduces from 5min to 3.5min on my laptop).\r\n\r\n### Committer

updates currently  get `(currentAcls, currentVersion)` for the resource from ZK and do a conditional update using `(currentAcls+newAcl, currentVersion)`. This supports concurrent atomic updates if the resource path already exists in ZK. If the path doesn't exist, we currently do a conditional createOrUpdate using `(newAcl, -1)`. But `-1` has a special meaning in ZooKeeper for update operations - it means match any version. So two brokers adding acls using `(newAcl1, -1)` and `(newAcl2, -1)` will result in one broker creating the path and setting `newAcl1`, while the other broker can potentially update the path with `(newAcl2, -1)`, losing `newAcl1`. The timing window is very small, but we have seen intermittent failures in `SimpleAclAuthorizerTest.testHighConcurrencyModificationOfResourceAcls` as a result of this window. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the version used for conditional updates in ZooKeeper. It also replaces the confusing `ZkVersion.NoVersion=-1` used for set(any-version) and get(return not-found) with `ZkVersion.MatchAnyVersion` for set(any-version) and `ZkVersion.UnknownVersion` for

actions such as a reconfiguration, the task configs are obtained\r\nvia `Worker.connectorTaskConfigs` and then subsequently saved into an\r\ninstance of `ClusterConfigState`.  The values of the properties that are saved\r\nare post-transformation (of variable references) when they should be\r\npre-transformation.  This is to avoid secrets appearing in plaintext in\r\nthe `connect-configs` topic, for example.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to change the 2 clients of `Worker.connectorTaskConfigs` to\r\nperform a reverse transformation (values converted back into variable\r\nreferences) before saving them into an instance of `ClusterConfigState`.\r\nThe 2 places where the save is performed are\r\n`DistributedHerder.reconfigureConnector` and\r\n`StandaloneHerder.updateConnectorTasks`.\r\n\r\nThe way that the reverse transformation works is by using the\r\n\"raw\" connector config (with variable references still intact) from\r\n`ClusterConfigState` to convert config values back into variable\r\nreferences for those keys that are common between the task config\r\nand the connector config.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 additional small changes that only affect `StandaloneHerder`:\r\n\r\n1) `ClusterConfigState.allTasksConfigs` has been changed to perform a\r\ntransformation (resolution) on all variable references.  This is\r\nnecessary because the result of this method is compared directly to\r\n`Worker.connectorTaskConfigs`, which also has variable references\r\nresolved.\r\n\r\n2) `StandaloneHerder.startConnector` has been changed to match\r\n`DistributedHerder.startConnector`.  This is to fix an issue where\r\nduring `StandaloneHerder.restartConnector`, the post-transformed\r\nconnector config would be saved back into `ClusterConfigState`.\r\n\r\nI also performed an analysis of all other code paths where configs are\r\nsaved back into `ClusterConfigState` and did not find any other\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

PR adds the optimization of eliminating multiple repartition topics when the `KStream` resulting from a key-changing operation executes other methods using the new key and reduces the repartition topics to one.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR leaves in place the optimization for re-using a source topic as a changelog topic for source `KTable` instances.  I'll have another follow-up PR to move the source topic optimization to a method within `InternalStreamsBuilder` so it can be performed in the same area of the code.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the current value of `StreamsConfig.OPTIMIZE` is `all` and we'll need to have another KIP to change the value to `2.1`.   \r\n\r\nAn integration test `RepartitionOptimizingIntegrationTest` which asserts the same results for an optimized topology with one repartition topic as the un-optimized version with four repartition topics.\r\nMore tests will be added, but I wanted to get reviews on the approach now.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including
