SSD takes precedence in data access, which speeds up computing\r\n2. Only 1 SSD is added, the cost is under control\r\n3. HDDs are still the backup storage, users no need worry about capacity\r\n\r\n**How it works**\r\nWhen Spark core allocates blocks (either for shuffle or RDD cache), it stores blocks in SSDs first, and when the SSD’s free space is less than some threshold, starting to use HDDs.\r\n\r\n**Performance Evaluation**\r\n1. At the best case, our solution performs the same as all SSDs.\r\n2. At the worst case, like all data are spilled to HDDs, no performance regression.\r\n3. Compared with all HDDs, tiered store improves `+x2` for machine learning workload and `+x1.7` for SparkSQL workload.\r\n\r\n**Usage**\r\n1. Enable tiered storage in spark-default.conf.\r\n```\r\nspark.diskStore.allocator      tiered\r\n```\r\n2. Configure storage hierarchy, for Yarn user, see below example:\r\n```\r\n  <property>\r\n    <name>yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs</name>\r\n    <value>/mnt/DP_disk1/yucai/yarn/local,/mnt/DP_disk2/yucai/yarn/local,\r\n           /mnt/DP_disk3/yucai/yarn/local,/mnt/DP_disk4/yucai/yarn/local,\r\n           /mnt/DP_disk5/yucai/yarn/local,/mnt/DP_disk6/yucai/yarn/local,\r\n    </value>\r\n  </property>\r\n  <property>\r\n    <name>yarn.nodemanager.spark-dirs-tiers</name>\r\n    <value>001111</value>\r\n  </property>\r\n```\r\nIt means DP_disk[1-2] are in tier1 and DP_disk[2-6] make up tier2.\r\n \r\n**More tiers**\r\nIn our implementation, we support to build any number tiers cross various storage medias (NVMe, SSD, HDD etc.). For example:\r\n```\r\n  <property>\r\n    <name>yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs</name>\r\n    <value>/mnt/DP_disk1/yucai/yarn/local,/mnt/DP_disk2/yucai/yarn/local,\r\n           /mnt/DP_disk3/yucai/yarn/local,/mnt/DP_disk4/yucai/yarn/local,\r\n           /mnt/DP_disk5/yucai/yarn/local,/mnt/DP_disk6/yucai/yarn/local,\r\n    </value>\r\n  </property>\r\n  <property>\r\n    <name>yarn.nodemanager.spark-dirs-tiers</name>\r\n    <value>001122</value>\r\n  </property>\r\n```\r\nIt means DP_disk[1-2] are in tier1, DP_disk[3-4] are in tier2 and DP_disk[5-6] make up tier3.","created_at":"2015-12-09T13:04:00Z","updated_at":"2020-04-17T09:07:57Z","closed_at":"2018-12-10T22:51:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"950e75b76ba78a4e96d1ece0ec8223ef2dadb8ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10225/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10225/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10225/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/507c506d1d8cdc1674bece4e4d149334b4ccf8b0","head":{"label":"yucai:hs","ref":"hs","sha":"507c506d1d8cdc1674bece4e4d149334b4ccf8b0","user":{"login":"yucai","id":2989575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODk1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2989575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai","html_url":"https://github.com/yucai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47689234,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzY4OTIzNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"yucai/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yucai","id":2989575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODk1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2989575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai","html_url":"https://github.com/yucai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yucai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yucai/spark","description":"Mirror

JDBC filters are not tested properly. All the tests pass even if the filters are not pushed down due to Spark-side filtering.\n\nIn this PR, \nFirstly, I corrected the tests to properly check the pushed down filters by removing Spark-side filtering.\nAlso, `!=` was being tested which is actually not pushed down. So I removed them.\nLastly, I moved the `stripSparkFilter()` function to `SQLTestUtils` as this functions would be shared for all tests for pushed down filters. This function would be also shared with ORC datasource as the filters for that are also not being tested properly.\n","created_at":"2015-12-09T07:39:24Z","updated_at":"2016-09-23T18:28:13Z","closed_at":"2015-12-16T01:03:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d7fbaf2019b39b5bf1950c1f08a44aa60d446117","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10221/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10221/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10221/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3294b31303d4f67d6a7e7b9125c3f38df0f01fda","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-12236","ref":"SPARK-12236","sha":"3294b31303d4f67d6a7e7b9125c3f38df0f01fda","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

this PR, I added the support to drop multiple columns by reference. This was only supported with the string names.\n\nAs `varargs` does not recognise the type for multuple variables, I changed `drop(colNames: String*)` to `drop(colName: String, colNames: String*)` correspondingly to `orderBy(sortCol: String, sortCols: String*)` and `sort(sortCol: String, sortCols: String*)`.\n\nAccordingly, the call in `drop(colName: String)` was changed.\n","created_at":"2015-12-09T06:38:28Z","updated_at":"2016-09-23T18:28:12Z","closed_at":"2015-12-11T03:07:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5b50af817a659f779b39fa68a6a8024a9522d674","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10218/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10218/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10218/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/22235269995f5c525da0d9aef948803883ca91ae","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-12227","ref":"SPARK-12227","sha":"22235269995f5c525da0d9aef948803883ca91ae","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

underflow.\n    at com.esotericsoftware.kryo.io.Input.require(Input.java:156)\n    at com.esotericsoftware.kryo.io.Input.skip(Input.java:131)\n    at com.esotericsoftware.kryo.io.Input.skip(Input.java:264)\n```\n\nThis is caused by a bug of kryo's `Input.skip(long count)`(https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo/issues/119) and we call this method in `KryoInputDataInputBridge`.\n\nInstead of upgrade kryo's version, this pr bypass the  kryo's `Input.skip(long count)` by directly call another `skip` method in kryo's Input.java(https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo/blob/kryo-2.21/src/com/esotericsoftware/kryo/io/Input.java#L124), i.e. write the bug-fixed version of `Input.skip(long count)` in

join types and conditions imply that the join keys cannot be NULL and\ncan be filtered out by the children. This patch does this for inner joins\nand introduces a mechanism to generate predicates. The complex part of doing\nthis is to make sure the transformation is stable. The problem that we want\nto avoid is generating a filter in the join, having that pushed down and then\nhaving the join regenerate the filter.\n\nThis patch solves this by having the join remember predicates that it has\ngenerated. This mechanism should be general enough that we can infer other\npredicates, for example \"a join b where a.id = b.id AND a.id = 10\" could\nalso use this mechanism to generate the predicate \"b.id = 10\".\n","created_at":"2015-12-08T23:55:10Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T09:27:12Z","closed_at":"2016-05-12T09:27:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3a34a3da0b983ad8c16568b04e766ee59a8ea621","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10209/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10209/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10209/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fb562fb67a761276456b14a81513f3fc69a6ead8","head":{"label":"nongli:spark-9372","ref":"spark-9372","sha":"fb562fb67a761276456b14a81513f3fc69a6ead8","user":{"login":"nongli","id":242468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjQ2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/242468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli","html_url":"https://github.com/nongli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":30051398,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDA1MTM5OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"nongli/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nongli","id":242468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjQ2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/242468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli","html_url":"https://github.com/nongli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nongli/spark","description":"Mirror

is, in a way, the basics to enable SPARK-529 (which was closed as\nwon't fix but I think is still valuable). In fact, Spark SQL created\nsomething for that, and this change basically factors out that code\nand inserts it into SparkConf, with some extra bells and whistles.\n\nTo showcase the usage of this pattern, I modified the YARN backend\nto use the new config keys (defined in the new `config` package object\nunder `o.a.s.deploy.yarn`). Most of the changes are mechanic, although\nlogic had to be slightly modified in a handful of

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12203\n\nCurrently, we have DirectKafkaInputDStream, which directly pulls messages from Kafka Brokers without any receivers, and KafkaInputDStream, which pulls messages from a Kafka Broker using receivers with zookeeper.\n\nAs we observed, because DirectKafkaInputDStream retrieves messages from Kafka after each batch finishes, it posts a latency compared with KafkaInputDStream that continues to pull messages during each batch window.\n\nSo we try to add KafkaDirectInputDStream that directly pulls messages from Kafka Brokers as DirectKafkaInputDStream, but it uses receivers as KafkaInputDStream and pulls messages as blocks during each batch window.\n","created_at":"2015-12-08T10:06:12Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:32:35Z","closed_at":"2015-12-29T02:56:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"847b0e41191ab03b6bc1c082e5082777a1426efc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10197/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10197/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10197/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e5d0a2b47e5930ded9b728bcb994872a579f9823","head":{"label":"viirya:kafka-direct-receiver","ref":"kafka-direct-receiver","sha":"e5d0a2b47e5930ded9b728bcb994872a579f9823","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

patch fixes a bug in the eviction of storage memory by execution.\n## The bug:\n\nIn general, execution should be able to evict storage memory when the total storage memory usage is greater than `maxMemory * spark.memory.storageFraction`. Due to a bug, however, Spark might wind up evicting no storage memory in certain cases where the storage memory usage was between `maxMemory * spark.memory.storageFraction` and `maxMemory`. For example, here is a regression test which illustrates the bug:\n\n``` scala\n    val maxMemory = 1000L\n    val taskAttemptId = 0L\n    val (mm, ms) = makeThings(maxMemory)\n    // Since we used the default storage fraction (0.5), we should be able to allocate 500 bytes\n    // of storage memory which are immune to eviction by execution memory pressure.\n\n    // Acquire enough storage memory to exceed the storage region size\n    assert(mm.acquireStorageMemory(dummyBlock, 750L, evictedBlocks))\n    assertEvictBlocksToFreeSpaceNotCalled(ms)\n    assert(mm.executionMemoryUsed === 0L)\n    assert(mm.storageMemoryUsed === 750L)\n\n    // At this point, storage is using 250 more bytes of memory than it is guaranteed, so execution\n    // should be able to reclaim up to 250 bytes of storage memory.\n    // Therefore, execution should now be able to require up to 500 bytes of memory:\n    assert(mm.acquireExecutionMemory(500L, taskAttemptId, MemoryMode.ON_HEAP) === 500L) // <--- fails by only returning 250L\n    assert(mm.storageMemoryUsed === 500L)\n    assert(mm.executionMemoryUsed === 500L)\n    assertEvictBlocksToFreeSpaceCalled(ms, 250L)\n```\n\nThe problem relates to the control flow / interaction between `StorageMemoryPool.shrinkPoolToReclaimSpace()` and `MemoryStore.ensureFreeSpace()`. While trying to allocate the 500 bytes of execution memory, the `UnifiedMemoryManager` discovers that it will need to reclaim 250 bytes of memory from storage, so it calls `StorageMemoryPool.shrinkPoolToReclaimSpace(250L)`. This method, in turn, calls `MemoryStore.ensureFreeSpace(250L)`. However, `ensureFreeSpace()` first checks whether the requested space is less than `maxStorageMemory - storageMemoryUsed`, which will be true if there is any free execution memory because it turns out that `MemoryStore.maxStorageMemory = (maxMemory - onHeapExecutionMemoryPool.memoryUsed)` when the `UnifiedMemoryManager` is used.\n\nThe control flow here is somewhat confusing (it grew to be messy / confusing over time / as a result of the merging / refactoring of several components). In the pre-Spark 1.6 code, `ensureFreeSpace` was called directly by the `MemoryStore` itself, whereas in 1.6 it's involved in a confusing control flow where `MemoryStore` calls `MemoryManager.acquireStorageMemory`, which then calls back into `MemoryStore.ensureFreeSpace`, which, in turn, calls `MemoryManager.freeStorageMemory`.\n## The solution:\n\nThe solution implemented in this patch is to remove the confusing circular control flow between `MemoryManager` and `MemoryStore`, making the storage memory acquisition process much more linear / straightforward. The key changes:\n- Remove a layer of inheritance which made the memory manager code harder to understand (53841174760a24a0df3eb1562af1f33dbe340eb9).\n- Move some bounds checks earlier in the call chain (13ba7ada77f87ef1ec362aec35c89a924e6987cb).\n- Refactor `ensureFreeSpace()` so that the part which evicts blocks can be called independently from the part which checks whether there is enough free space to avoid eviction (7c68ca09cb1b12f157400866983f753ac863380e).\n- Realize that this lets us remove a layer of overloads from `ensureFreeSpace` (eec4f6c87423d5e482b710e098486b3bbc4daf06).\n- Realize that `ensureFreeSpace()` can simply be replaced with an `evictBlocksToFreeSpace()` method which is called [after we've already figured out](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/2dc842aea82c8895125d46a00aa43dfb0d121de9/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/memory/StorageMemoryPool.scala#L88) how much memory needs to be reclaimed via eviction; (2dc842aea82c8895125d46a00aa43dfb0d121de9).\n\nAlong the way, I fixed some problems with the mocks in `MemoryManagerSuite`: the old mocks would [unconditionally](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/80a824d36eec9d9a9f092ee1741453851218ec73/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/memory/MemoryManagerSuite.scala#L84) report that a block had been evicted even if there was enough space in the storage pool such that eviction would be avoided.\n\nI also fixed a problem where `StorageMemoryPool._memoryUsed` might become negative due to freed memory being double-counted when excution evicts storage. The problem was that `StorageMemoryPoolshrinkPoolToFreeSpace` would [decrement `_memoryUsed`](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/7c68ca09cb1b12f157400866983f753ac863380e#diff-935c68a9803be144ed7bafdd2f756a0fL133) even though `StorageMemoryPool.freeMemory` had already decremented it as each evicted block was freed.

`LocalRelation`) are warpped with SubQueries, they can't invoke the right `sameResult` function in their own implementation. So we need to eliminate SubQueries first and then try to invoke `sameResult` function in their own implementation.\nLike:\nWhen plan is `Subquery(LogicalRelation(relation:ParquetRelation[hdfs://9.91.8.131:9000/user/hive/warehouse/src_p], expectedOutputAttributes:Some(ArrayBuffer(key#0, value#1))))`, first eliminate SubQueries, and then will invoke the `sameResult` function in `LogicalRelation` instead of `LogicalPlan`.\n","created_at":"2015-12-07T04:00:39Z","updated_at":"2015-12-07T07:16:23Z","closed_at":"2015-12-07T07:16:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"494000ca6f4e6c33549519aba851399ea7f36b53","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10169/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10169/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10169/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f1ef856ee4fa45bcd2143bf164dab61f6f17ce63","head":{"label":"watermen:patch-2","ref":"patch-2","sha":"f1ef856ee4fa45bcd2143bf164dab61f6f17ce63","user":{"login":"watermen","id":1400819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDA4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1400819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen","html_url":"https://github.com/watermen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26309097,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjMwOTA5Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"watermen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"watermen","id":1400819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDA4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1400819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen","html_url":"https://github.com/watermen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/watermen/spark","description":"Mirror

PR improves `LogicalPlan.sameResult` so that semantically equivalent queries with different order of predicates are still matched. \n\nConsider an example:\nQuery 1: CACHE TABLE first AS SELECT \\* FROM table A where A.id >100 AND A.id < 200;\nQuery 2: SELECT \\* FROM table A where A.id < 200 AND A.id > 100;\nCurrently in SparkSQL, Query 2 cannot utilize the cache result of query 1, although query 1 and query 2 are the same if ignoring the order of the predicates.\nWe modified the compare function `LogicalPlan.sameResult`. The idea is to split the condition of filter into a sequence of expressions and wrap it into a set. Now we can easily compare the sets rather than literally compare the conditions, thus ignoring the order of the

`jsonFile` has been deprecated by Spark SQL and will be removed at Spark 2.0. So we mark `jsonFile` deprecated and use `read.json` at SparkR side.\n- Replace all `jsonFile` with `read.json` at test_sparkSQL.R, but still keep jsonFile test case.\n- If this PR is accepted, we

uses `MapObjects` to extract Scala objects from `InternalRow`s. During the process, `MapObjects.completeFunction` plays the role of a lambda function within the SQL space.  However, there lies an contradiction:\n1.  `completeFunction` is not a constructor argument of `MapObjects`. This stops `ExpressionEncoder.resolve` to transform inner `NewInstance` expressions within `completeFunction` to fill in outer pointers for nested classes.\n2.  On the other hand, once we make `completeFunction` a constructor arguments, it will be eagerly resolved by the analyzer. But this \"lambda\" function should only be resolved while being \"applied\" within the generated code.\n\nThis PR tries to fix this issue by specializing `MapObjects` in `ExpressionEncoder.resolve`, and adding an extra argument list to the constructor to pass in an optional copy of the transformed `completeFunction`.\n","created_at":"2015-12-03T17:10:39Z","updated_at":"2015-12-10T05:45:51Z","closed_at":"2015-12-10T05:45:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1ca893911cbb503a8e741eb123d2eb4c42c4633a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10133/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10133/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10133/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b73f3c9c2bfd3e8a2e4009e44370f4f8c1ecf3e0","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-12131.encoder-for-array-of-inner-class","ref":"spark-12131.encoder-for-array-of-inner-class","sha":"b73f3c9c2bfd3e8a2e4009e44370f4f8c1ecf3e0","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

expressions` are only allowed in `Project` or `Filter`,And only when we use nondeterministic expressions in `UnaryNode` can be pulled out.\n\nBut,Sometime in many case,we will use nondeterministic expressions to process `join keys` avoiding data skew.for example:\n\n```\nselect * \nfrom tableA a \njoin \n(select * from tableB) b \non upper((case when (a.brand_code is null or a.brand_code = '' ) then cast( (-rand() * 10000000 ) as string ) else a.brand_code end ))  = b.brand_code\n\n```\n\nThis PR introduce a mechanism to pull out nondeterministic expressions from `Join`,so we can use nondeterministic expression in `Join` appropriately.\n","created_at":"2015-12-03T10:20:59Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T22:46:18Z","closed_at":"2016-06-15T22:46:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d96d18b2b95e8797db63b3ae659b28c430b16cee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10128/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10128/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10128/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b2a4a6bd193033512b400bb9434a92864d4553a8","head":{"label":"zhonghaihua:pulloutJoinNondeterministic","ref":"pulloutJoinNondeterministic","sha":"b2a4a6bd193033512b400bb9434a92864d4553a8","user":{"login":"zhonghaihua","id":4409429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDk0Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4409429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua","html_url":"https://github.com/zhonghaihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":30346856,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDM0Njg1Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"zhonghaihua/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhonghaihua","id":4409429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDk0Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4409429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua","html_url":"https://github.com/zhonghaihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhonghaihua/spark","description":"Mirror
