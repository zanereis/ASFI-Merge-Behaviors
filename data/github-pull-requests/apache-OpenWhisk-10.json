Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nOn invoking an action blocking, a ResultMessage and afterwards a CompletionMessage will be sent from the invoker to the controller. The CompletionMessage is always very small. Currently those two messages are sent asynchronously. If log-collection is very fast, they are sent to Kafka at the same point in time.\r\nThis could result into the condition, that the loadbalancer receives the completion-ack before the result ack. This will make the response to the customer slower, as the controller first needs to go against Kafka.\r\n\r\nThis PR will ensure, that the completion message will be sent after the reult message has been published successfully to Kafka.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n## Description\r\nWhen performing `KindRestrictor.check()`, merge the contents of both the namespace's `allowedKinds` limit with the system's default `whitelist` of allowed kinds.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the namespace's value for the `allowedKinds` limit was used _instead of_ the value of the default `whitelist` set for the system. However, while crafting a deployment plan enabling whitelist support, we ran into concerns around maintaining these per-namespace whitelists as the system and user/namespace population grows.\r\n\r\nThe most notable scenario of concern is when a kind is added or removed from the OW system's runtime manifest. After these are added to the manifest, any existing default `whitelist` will need to be updated to include/exclude the new kind. This is an expected maintenance operation. However, in addition to this, _all **existing** limits_ for namespaces' `allowedKinds` additionally have to be modified.\r\n\r\nAs new kinds enter the system, enabling access to new kinds (which are _already accessible_ for those _without_ an explicit namespace `allowedKinds` limit) will require a batch operation (or similar migration) to update all existing `allowedKinds` namespace limits. This becomes a particularly unnecessary operation that can grow over time.\r\n\r\nThe solution outlined in this PR is to reduce the need to perform updates per-namespace when the default whitelist can be merged together with the namespace limit.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [X] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

negative auth responses to avoid going to the DB with every identical call \r\n\r\n## Description\r\nSince negative auth responses (Identity.get) are not cached, \r\nall requests with a non existing namespace or an invalid authkey will perform queries to the subject db.\r\nA user can influence OW performance by issuing a high number of those calls.\r\n\r\nThIs PR changes that behavior in the way, that negative auth results are cached as None value.\r\nSubsequent Identical calls will only use the cache (for the 5 minutes cache period).\r\nThe external interface and behavior of the Identity.get methods stays unchanged.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change \r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (generally a non-breaking change which closes an issue).\r\n- [x] Enhancement or new feature (adds new functionality).\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (a bug fix or enhancement which changes existing behavior).\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] I signed an [Apache CLA](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [x] I reviewed the [style guides](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/wiki/Contributing:-Git-guidelines#code-readiness) and followed the recommendations (Travis CI will check :).\r\n- [x] I added tests to cover my changes.\r\n- [ ] My changes require further changes to the documentation.\r\n- [ ] I updated the documentation where necessary.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-08T13:22:08Z","updated_at":"2018-11-15T10:32:19Z","closed_at":"2018-11-15T05:49:38Z","merged_at":"2018-11-15T05:49:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"536ce94af92a9b72ae1b82b16242d2c8177478b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/pulls/4104/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/pulls/4104/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4104/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/statuses/cccedc2d03f539de82061c0c5b0e47fb256b4255","head":{"label":"mhenke1:identity_cache_improvement","ref":"identity_cache_improvement","sha":"cccedc2d03f539de82061c0c5b0e47fb256b4255","user":{"login":"mhenke1","id":15377852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzc3ODUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15377852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1","html_url":"https://github.com/mhenke1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"775b757ac7555c8371a5e03497622531984bf4f4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52039373,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjAzOTM3Mw==","name":"openwhisk","full_name":"apache/openwhisk","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk","description":"Apache

an user invokes an action blockingly today, the invoker executes the activation and sends back the result to the controller, which passes it back to the client. If it is not possible to pass the result back to the controller, it will try to get it from the database. And here's the problem. If the controller receives the result of the activation from the invoker, there are no logs included. If it polls it from the database, the logs are included.

and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nWhen the execute _send()_ on the Kafka producer from the underlying java library fails, there is bunch of Kafka exceptions we do not catch. In some cases the Callback is not executed as a result of the call and it could be the reason of the consumer hangup https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/issues/4076. Since we still do not fully understand the nature of the failures, the main aim of this PR is to expose the exceptions that happen in the producer. \r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] The issues is already here https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/issues/4076\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [x] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

newSize = 1000\r\n  val fraction = 0.99\r\n  val managed = Math.max(1, Math.ceil(newSize.toDouble * (1 - fraction)).toInt)\r\n  val blackboxes = Math.max(1, Math.floor(newSize.toDouble * fraction).toInt)\r\n```\r\nThe manged number in above codes will be `11`\r\nThe blackboxes number will be `990`\r\nObviously, the correct manged number should be `10`.\r\nSo i think use `Math.round` may be more reasonable\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change

Description\r\n\r\nThese two tests are failing intermittently in our pipeline and travis. But unfortunately I'm not able to reproduce the problem locally.\r\nBut my theory, why these tests fail is the following:\r\nThe two commands `suspend` and `resume` are returning Futures. My theory is, that these asynchronous calls are not finished, when we check if the methods inside these methods have been called.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

more diagnostic information for Docker command failures as well as timeouts. Also emit new counter metrics for timed out Docker commands.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis change improves diagnostic information for failing Docker commands as well as timed out Docker commands:\r\n    * For all failures (including timeouts), a textual representation for exit status values is logged.\r\n    * Timeouts are explicitly detected and reported using a specialized exception allowing for a better timeout handling on higher layers of the Docker container implementation.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a set of new counter metrics that are emitted if a Docker command is terminated because of a timeout. A high number of such timeout occurrences is usually an indication for highly loaded invokers. The new metrics help to identify such invokers.\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [X] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

may return more results than those specified by `limit`\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n`CosmosDBArtifactStore` query can return more results than those specified via limit. This would happen for the case involving join operation which can result in more than 1 result for a given input.\r\n\r\nThis can happen when a subject is queried by name. For example consider a subject having 2 namespaces\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"_id\": \"team1\",\r\n  \"_rev\": \"1-c3fa3d69b8474f97dbbee70cde821802\",\r\n  \"namespaces\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"team1\",\r\n      \"key\": \"k1\",\r\n      \"uuid\": \"uuid1\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"team1-dev\",\r\n      \"key\": \"k2\",\r\n      \"uuid\": \"uuid2\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"subject\": \"team1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen we query this via \r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT r AS view \r\nFROM root r \r\nJOIN n in r.namespaces \r\nWHERE \r\n  (NOT(IS_DEFINED(r.blocked)) OR r.blocked = false) \r\n    AND (r.subject = 'team1' OR n.name = 'team1')\r\n```\r\nFor such queries the limit is not passed on to the db as some of the checks related to subjects are not possible via query. Hence we fetch more results than limit. In this case it would result in 2 entries referring to same `team1`. \r\n\r\nFor such cases we need to ensure that stream result in entries under specified `limit`\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [x] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

current setup reading code attachment more than 8 MB results in error (#4028). Increase `max-content-length` to 50 MB allows reading code attachments upto maximum allowed 48 MB\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nAkka uses [max-content-length][1] to ensure limits on incoming request entities. By default it is 8 MB while OpenWhisk allows max code upto 48 MB. To enable such large action code as attachment increase the max-content-length to 50 MB\r\n\r\n### Basic Test\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a system basic test to ensure that such large actions can be created. Due to constrained resource on travis test only create action code upto 10 MB. However it can be increased via config by setting system property `whisk.action.size.max` (in MB)\r\n\r\nThis test would also help to validate if the proxy and other settings are properly configured. See #3712 for details on which all settings need to be configured\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#4028)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

inconsistent log output (compared to DockerToActivationLogStore)\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses these by:\r\n- adding a config to indicate the splunk query offset, where query will be `<activation start> - offset` and `<activation end> + offset`\r\n- refactoring splunk api results to be formatted same as DockerToActivationLogStore\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a

summarized in #4045, the previous #4010 PR, which changed Access-Control-Allow-Headers from a 2-element list to a wildcard was misguided. Despite whatwg introducing wildcard support in 2016, only Chrome as of yet supports this feature. So, for now, we need to back off to a specifically enumerated list of allowed headers. This PR reverts the wildcard change, but expands the list from the initial 2 to include a few more common headers, e.g. User-Agent.\r\n\r\nFixes #4045\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#4045)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

now, an active-ack is sent before logs of a container are collected. If one customer writes a lot of logs or if log-collection is slow for some other reason, the invoker already gets new activations, that are queueing up.\r\nThis PR changes the behavior, to send the active-ack (for non-blocking) activations after log collection is finished. For blocking actions, there are two active acks now.

KAFKA_MESSAGE_MAX_BYTES should be larger than whisk.activation.payload.max to account for data being added to the activation record when it is serialized by the Kafka producer.

PR extends #3984 by adding support for passing base64 encoded config via environment variable\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nWith #3984 support was added for passing in typesafe config as env variable.

PR enables to use the REST based test helpers with bearer token based authentication.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis change enables use the existing REST based test helpers also for test cases using  \r\nbearer token based authentication.\r\nWhen flagged as such in `WskProps` the key used by the REST test helpers is returned as\r\nOauth bearer token instead of a Basic Authentication header.\r\n\r\nAs described above the fix leverages the existing WskProps and WskRestOperations infrastructure to enable the testing with minimal changes.\r\nA future (better) solution - which I was not able to target now - would refactor WskProps to contain the GenericAuthKey instead of a simple `authKey` string. This solution does require much more effort, since the usage of the authkey has to be de-tangled first from non authentication related usages.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I opened an

It appears this functionality is covering up a bug in the controller/invoker/Kafka path. The Kafka `completed` topic is not configured to handle non-default action response sizes. As a result, all action responses that exceed the Kafka default message payload size are retrieved via DB polling. Given that the controller polls the database for a blocking invocation's response every ~15 seconds, actions that generate large responses may appear to be very slow to complete.\r\n\r\n\r\nDepends on https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/pull/4040\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [x] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [x] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

make use of [Request Units (RU)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/request-units) for throughput provisioning. This PR emits the charged RU as a metric which helps in monitoring the resource consumption based on collection and action performed.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nEach request made to CosmosDB incurs some change in the form of RU spent for that request processing. This charge info is provided via response header `x-ms-request-charge`\r\n\r\n```\r\nx-ms-session-token: 4:3\r\nx-ms-request-charge: 5.24\r\nx-ms-serviceversion: version=2.0.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR expose the charge as a metric named `cosmosdb_ru_used`. It also associates some tags like\r\n\r\n- `mode` - `read` or `write`\r\n- `collection` - Name of collection i.e. `activations`, `whisks` and `subjects`\r\n- `action` - Type of operation performed. Example `get`, `put` etc\r\n\r\nIf tags are not enabled the metric name is generated like `cosmosdb.ru.<collecton name>.<action>`\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [x] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nThe bugs are not critical, but could hit at some point in edge cases: \r\n* When the invoker sends a Ping message and never changes its state to Healthy after that, its name contains only the id without unique and displayed names\r\n* `instanceToRef` Map contains the mapping from InstanceId to Actor ref. This accumulates stale data if some invokers get restarted and register under new ids.\r\n\r\nI fixed the issues by:\r\n* store the full name after registering a new invoker into internal bookkeeping\r\n* replaced the mapping in `instanceToRef` to use Int instead of InstanceId. \r\nThe unit tests coving those change are in place as well.\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

change upgrades caffeine to the [latest version 2.6.2](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/releases)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis change upgrades caffeine to the latest version.\r\nMain reason for this change is to make the expiration per entry interfaces available\r\nwith the latest fixes. Though openwhisk does not exploit this feature (yet),\r\nauthentication SPI implementations can use this feature to cache tokens based on their\r\nexpiry date.\r\n\r\nThe selected version is also the one required by the latest version of `scaffeine`\r\nwhich might be a worthwhile way to scala-fy the usage of caffeine in openwhisk.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [x] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (generally a non-breaking change which closes an issue).\r\n- [x] Enhancement or new feature (adds new functionality).\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (a bug fix or enhancement which changes existing behavior).\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] I signed an [Apache

PR enhances the [wskadmin-next](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/tools/admin/README-NEXT.md) tooling with `--force` and `--revoke` flags that allow updating user auth key.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nCurrently wskadmin (and next) allow adding a namespace with or without specific auth key.\r\nIn some cases, it is handy to allow updating existing namespace with specific auth key, or regenerating new key.\r\nThere are 2 flags being added in this PR:\r\n- `--revoke`, abbreviated `-r`: regenerate a new key for the user / namespace, UUID remains the same\r\n- `--force`, abbreviated `-f`:\r\n    - with `--auth uuid:key`: the new auth value is updated for the user\r\n    - without `--auth`: an auth of new UUID and key is randomly generated\r\n\r\n## Related issue and

With the use of a forwarder, the entities written to file can be stored in external logging services such as ElasticSearch, etc. External services that specialize in logging provide better search capabilities than OpenWhisk offers for activations and user logs. In addition, forwarding activations and user log to an external service will reduce pressure on the artifact store, helping scalability.\r\n\r\nThese changes are similar to `DockerToActivationFileLogStore`, but also allow the controller to write activations and user logs to file (needed for triggers, sequences, conductors).\r\n\r\nHere is an example what gets written to file for an action that writes two log lines. Note that activation result is not written as the result may contain sensitive information that should not be stored.\r\n```\r\ncat invoker0/userlogs-1535483579922.log | grep 033b3f0b04af4ba8bb3f0b04af1ba8c8 | jq\r\n{\r\n  \"message\": \"2018-08-28T19:13:21.468643245Z stdout: First log line\",\r\n  \"activaitonId\": \"033b3f0b04af4ba8bb3f0b04af1ba8c8\",\r\n  \"namespaceId\": \"ca55b4aa-36bb-4c13-8f49-e0269c944256\",\r\n  \"type\": \"user_log\"\r\n}\r\n{\r\n  \"message\": \"2018-08-28T19:13:21.468877412Z stdout: Second log line\",\r\n  \"activaitonId\": \"033b3f0b04af4ba8bb3f0b04af1ba8c8\",\r\n  \"namespaceId\": \"ca55b4aa-36bb-4c13-8f49-e0269c944256\",\r\n  \"type\": \"user_log\"\r\n}\r\n{\r\n  \"duration\": 52,\r\n  \"name\": \"logs\",\r\n  \"namespaceId\": \"ca55b4aa-36bb-4c13-8f49-e0269c944256\",\r\n  \"subject\": \"user@openwhisk\",\r\n  \"path\": \"user@openwhisk/logs\",\r\n  \"waitTime\": 212,\r\n  \"activationId\": \"033b3f0b04af4ba8bb3f0b04af1ba8c8\",\r\n  \"publish\": false,\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"response\": {\r\n    \"success\": true,\r\n    \"status\": \"success\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"end\": 1535483601470,\r\n  \"message\": \"Activation record '033b3f0b04af4ba8bb3f0b04af1ba8c8' for entity 'logs'\",\r\n  \"kind\": \"nodejs:6\",\r\n  \"start\": 1535483601418,\r\n  \"limits\": {\r\n    \"timeout\": 60000,\r\n    \"memory\": 256,\r\n    \"logs\": 10\r\n  },\r\n  \"initTime\": 43,\r\n  \"namespace\": \"user@openwhisk\",\r\n  \"type\": \"activation_record\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: with this SPI activation results are stored in the backing database, but not writing to the user log file.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [x] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
