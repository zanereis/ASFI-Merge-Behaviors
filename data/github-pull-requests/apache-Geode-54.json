problems have been addressed:\r\n  First, the recursive reconnect logic in InternalDistributedSystem was\r\n  broken.  After recursion created a new cache the higher up reconnect()\r\n  method did not handle things correctly and called things like\r\n  createAndStartCacheServers() on the defunct cache and notifying\r\n  reconnect-listeners that the defunct DistributedSystem had been\r\n  successfully created.  The test for\r\n  reconnecting after role-loss was also messed up and needed to have\r\n  its end conditions changed a bit.\r\n\r\n  Second, the execution of role-loss actions was being done under a\r\n  synchronization on the distribution advisor.  That was periodically\r\n  causing a deadlock if we receive an update for the distribution advisor.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

several tests, a listener calls disconnectFromDS() to disconnect its member when a certain event occurs.\r\n\r\nThe tests do not wait for the listener to finish disconnecting.\r\n\r\nWhen the tests end, the cleanup also calls `disconnectFromDS()` to disconnect the same member.\r\n\r\nWithin `disconnectFromDS()`, `InternalDistributedSystem.disconnect()` is called twice, once on the system the test framework knows about, and once on whatever system `InternalDistributedSystem.getConnectedInstance()` returns.\r\n\r\nIf two calls to `disconnect()` are in progress at the same time, one blocks until the other finishes.\r\n\r\nIf the test ends before the listener finishes, the listener appears to wait until a later test reuses the same VM, at which time it disconnects whatever system it finds there. We do not know why it waits. We suspect that multiple calls to `disconnect()` (from the listener and from the framework's normal cleanup routine) are interacting in some way.\r\n\r\nThe later test fails if the listener's second call to `disconnect()` occurs after the test has started a member in the same VM.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the problem, we:\r\n* Wait for the listener to finish before ending the test.\r\n* Remove the listener at the end of the test, so that it does not\r\nrespond to events in later tests.\r\n\r\nSigned-Off-By: Helena Bales <hbales@pivotal.io>\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

AlertAppender\r\nGEODE-2644: Cleanup LocalizedMessageTest\r\n\r\nThis last commit for LocalizedMessageTest might conflict with Bruce's PR https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/2562 but the end result would just be to delete LocalizedMessageTest.\r\n\r\nAfter this cleanup, the remaining commits for GEODE-2644 that haven't yet been committed are the new Appenders, wiring them in and deleting the old Appenders.","created_at":"2018-10-05T20:12:04Z","updated_at":"2018-10-05T22:53:07Z","closed_at":"2018-10-05T22:53:04Z","merged_at":"2018-10-05T22:53:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"f8bb38acf0109e9fe1711189167c1363b4c21053","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jdeppe-pivotal","id":5313410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTM0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5313410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/jdeppe-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"sboorlagadda","id":7171016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNzEwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7171016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda","html_url":"https://github.com/sboorlagadda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bschuchardt","id":7441204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDEyMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7441204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/bschuchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/2573/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/2573/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/2573/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/baad4f0f730186fec16add42391a93f99b9f6340","head":{"label":"kirklund:GEODE-2644-cleanup","ref":"GEODE-2644-cleanup","sha":"baad4f0f730186fec16add42391a93f99b9f6340","user":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58218609,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODIxODYwOQ==","name":"geode","full_name":"kirklund/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_ur

have a lot of Awaitility calls in our tests. Each test was picking\r\nits own timeout. That lead to some tests picking too small of a timeout\r\nand failing spuriously.\r\n\r\nWith this change, all tests will use a new factory,\r\nGeodeAwaility.await(), rather than Awaitility.await(). This new factory\r\nsets a default timeout of 5 minutes. It also sets a sensible pollDelay\r\nand pollInterval.\r\n\r\nThe custom timeouts used in all tests have been removed, in favor of\r\nthis new factory, except for a couple of tests that had waits greater\r\nthan 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Deprecate PDX Persistence on Client\r\n\r\nCurrently, even when set, the PDX metadata is not persisted on the\r\nclient side (to avoid dealing with problems that might arise if the\r\nclient's PDX data is inconsistent with the server).\r\n\r\n- Methods `setPdxPersistent` and `setPdxDiskStore` from\r\n  `ClientCacheFactory` have been deprecated.\r\n- Attributes `persistent` and `disk-store-name` from the element `pdx`\r\n  have been deprecated (new complex type `client-pdx-type` has been\r\n  added to avoid messing with the pdx definition used for non-clients).\r\n- A `warning` message will now be logged when creating the cache if we\r\n  detect that PDX persistence has been configured for a client cache.\r\n- Added test methods to `ClientCacheFactoryJUnitTest`, also replaced\r\n  the usage of `junit.Assert` by `assertj`, and manual file\r\n  manipulation/cleanup by `TemporaryFolder` rule.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline

internal class `DefaultHashMap` was designed as an internal\r\nworkaround to return a default value whenever the value returned by\r\n`Map.get(K)` was `null`. Starting with Java 8 the `Map` interface\r\nadded the method `getOrDefault`, which does something similar in a more\r\nefficient way but it returns the default only if the key doesn't exist.\r\nAfter inspecting the code, we don't insert `null` values into the\r\n`statsMap`, so it is safe to delete the old `DefaultHashMap` class and\r\nreplace its usaged by `Map.getOrDefault`.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

to make handling of EOFException and SocketException consistent.  This exception handling and an Assert were the only differences between readDataSerializable(DataInput) and readDataSerializableFixedID(DataInput), so we refactored that and were able to delete the FixedID version of the method.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't make sense that we would handle EOFException and SocketException in readDataSerializable(DataInput), but not in readDataSerializableFixedID(DataInput).  Looking back at the history of the original EOFException handling in readDataSerializable(DataInput), it looks like this was a quick patch fix because this exception was seen/unhandled in readDataSerializable(DataInput), but there is no reason the same issue couldn't happen in the readDataSerializableFixedID(DataInput) method as well.\r\n\r\nIn TCPServer, we were swallowing EOFExceptions, so it makes sense to do the same for SocketExceptions since they can also be caused by the client closing their socket.  This has no functional implications other than we won't log an info (or fatal, depending on if the socket is closed) error message.  We still will loop back around and accept new connections with this change.
