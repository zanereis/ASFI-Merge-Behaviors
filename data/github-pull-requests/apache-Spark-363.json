What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds pagination support for the Job Tables in the Jobs tab. Pagination is provided for all of the three Job Tables (active, completed, and failed). Interactions (jumping, sorting, and setting page size) for paged tables are also included.\n\nThe diff didn't keep track of some lines based on the original ones. The function `makeRow`of the original `AllJobsPage.scala` is reused. They are separated at the beginning of the function `jobRow` (L427-439) and the function `row`(L594-618) in the new `AllJobsPage.scala`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested manually by using checking the Web UI after completing and failing hundreds of jobs.\nGenerate completed jobs by:\n\n``` scala\nval d = sc.parallelize(Array(1,2,3,4,5))\nfor(i <- 1 to 255){ var b = d.collect() }\n```\n\nGenerate failed jobs by calling the following code multiple times:\n\n``` scala\nvar b = d.map(_/0).collect()\n```\n\nInteractions like jumping, sorting, and setting page size are all tested.\n\nThis shows the pagination for completed jobs:\n![paginate success jobs](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5558370/15986498/efa12ef6-303b-11e6-8b1d-c3382aeb9ad0.png)\n\nThis shows the sorting works in job tables:\n![sorting](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5558370/15986539/98c8a81a-303c-11e6-86f2-8d2bc7924ee9.png)\n\nThis shows the pagination for failed jobs and the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, `AFTAggregator` is not being merged correctly. For example, if there is any single empty partition in the data, this creates an `AFTAggregator` with zero total count which causes the exception below:\n\n```\nIllegalArgumentException: u'requirement failed: The number of instances should be greater than 0.0, but got 0.'\n```\n\nPlease see [AFTSurvivalRegression.scala#L573-L575](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/6ecedf39b44c9acd58cdddf1a31cf11e8e24428c/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/regression/AFTSurvivalRegression.scala#L573-L575) as well.\n\nJust to be clear, the python example `aft_survival_regression.py` seems using 5 rows. So, if there exist partitions more than 5, it throws the exception above since it contains empty partitions which results in an incorrectly merged `AFTAggregator`.\n\nExecuting `bin/spark-submit examples/src/main/python/ml/aft_survival_regression.py` on a machine with CPUs more than 5 is being failed because it creates tasks with some empty partitions with defualt  configurations (AFAIK, it sets the parallelism level to the number of CPU cores).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAn unit test in `AFTSurvivalRegressionSuite.scala` and manually tested by `bin/spark-submit examples/src/main/python/ml/aft_survival_regression.py`.\n","created_at":"2016-06-11T16:55:10Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:42:42Z","closed_at":"2016-06-12T21:28:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e30d4e923edb307186d5156dfe75a6534a531c06","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13619/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13619/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13619/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2c8adbfe53493b4bcef1a633ab429f6612c67fe5","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-15892","ref":"SPARK-15892","sha":"2c8adbfe53493b4bcef1a633ab429f6612c67fe5","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nReduce `spark.memory.fraction` default to 0.6 in order to make it fit within default JVM old generation size (2/3 heap). See JIRA discussion. This means a full cache doesn't spill into the new gen.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is a pull request adding support for Multilayer Perceptron Regression, the counterpart to the Multilayer Perceptron Classifier (hereafter MLPR and MLPC). \n#### Outline\n1. Major Changes\n2. API Decisions\n3. Automating Scaling\n4. Naming\n5. Features\n6. Reference Resources\n7. Testing\n\nConvenience Link to JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10409\n## Major Changes\n\nThere are two major differences between MLPR and MLPC. The first is the use of an linear (identity) activation function and a sum of squared error cost function in the last layer of the network. The second is the requirement to scale the data to [0,1] and back to make it easy for the weights to fit a value in the proper range. \n#### Linear, Relu, Tanh Activations\n\nIn the forward pass the linear activation passes the value from the fully connected layer through to become the network prediction. In weight adjustment during the backward pass its derivative is one. All regression models will use the linear activation in the last layer, and so there is no option (as there is in MLPC) to use another activation function and cost function in the last layer.\n\nThe Relu and Tanh are activation functions that will benefit the accuracy and convergence speed MLPC and MLPR. Tanh zero-centers the data passed to neurons which aids optimization. Relu avoids saturating the gradients.\n#### Automated Scaling\n\nThe data scaling is done through min-max scaling, where the minimum label is subtracted from every value (leading to a range from [0 to max-min]) and then dividing by max-min to get a scale from 0 to 1. The corner case where max-min = 0 is resolved by omitting the division step. \n#### Motivating Examples\n\n<img width=\"870\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-10 at 11 26 18 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4738024/15983614/d1ef0fe2-2f62-11e6-89f1-dc0c0dd6be94.png\">\n\n![screen shot 2016-06-10 at 11 16 46 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4738024/15983589/86643c60-2f61-11e6-840a-7a26dac9948e.png)\n## API Decisions\n\nThe API is identical to MLPC with the exception of softmaxOnTop - there is no option on the last layer activation function, or on the cost function to be used (MLPC gives a choice between cross entropy and sum of square error). This API has the user call MLPR with a set of layers that represent the topology of the network. The number of hidden layers is inferred by the parameter for the labels and is equal to the total number of layers - 2. Each hidden layer will be a feedforward layer with a sigmoid activation function up to the output layer and its linear activation.\n#### Input/Output Layer Argument\n\nFor MLPR, the output count will always be 1, and the number of inputs will always be equal to the number of features in the training dataset. One API choice could be to omit the input and output counts and only have the user supply the number of neurons in the hidden layers, and automate the input and output counts by looking at the training data. At the very least, it makes sense to validate the user’s layer parameter and display a helpful error message instead of the error in the data stacker that currently appears if the improper number of inputs or outputs is provided.\n#### Modular API\n\nIt also would make sense for the API to be modular. A user will want the flexibility to use the linear layer at different points in the network (as well as in MLPC), and will certainly want to be able to use new activation functions (tanh, relu) that are added to improve the performance of these models. That flexibility allows a user to tune the network to their dataset and will be particularly important for convnets or recurrent nets in future. We should decide on the best way to enable tanh and relu activations in this algorithm and in the classifier for the time being.\n## Automating Scaling\n\nCurrent behavior is to automatically scale the data for the user. This makes a pass over the data. There are a few options. We could:\n1. Scale data internally, always.\n2. Scale data internally unless user provides min/max themselves.\n3. Create argument that turns internal scaling off/on. Default it to one or the other. Warn user if running on unscaled data. \n\nAs well as all the variants between autoscaling or not, adding an argument or not, and warning the user or not. \n\nThe algorithm will run quite poorly on unscaled data, and so it makes sense to safeguard the user from this. But the same will be true of data that is not centered and scaled, and we don’t provide this automatically (though it may not be a bad idea as an option, given how sensitive this non-convex (whenever there are hidden layers) function can be to unscaled data). And so there’s a question of how much we hold the user’s hand. I advocate for helpful defaults that can be overridden, where we scale automatically but give an option to run without scaling and don’t run autoscaling if both the min and max are provided by the user.\n## Naming\n\nLastly there’s the naming of the multiLayerPerceptron/ multilayerPerceptronRegresson function in the FeedForwardTopology class in Layer.scala. For consistency it may make sense to change multiLayerPerceptron to multiLayerPerceptronClassifier. \n## Features\n\nThere are a few features that have been checked:\n1. Integrates cleanly with pipeline API\n2. Model save/load is enabled\n3. The example data is the popular LoadBoston dataset, scaled. \n4. Example code is included\n## Reference Resources\n\nChristopher M. Bishop. Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition.\nPatrick Nicolas. Scala for Machine Learning, Chapter 9.\nIan Goodfellow Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville. Deep Learning, Chapter 6.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe unit tests follow MLPC with the addition of a test for gradient descent. There are unit tests for:\n1. L-BFGS behavior on toy data\n2. Gradient descent on toy data\n3. Input Validation\n4. Set Weights Parameter\n5. Save/Load Functionality working\n6. Read / Write returns a model with similar layers and weights\n7. Support for all Numeric Types\n","created_at":"2016-06-11T06:54:36Z","updated_at":"2019-10-26T21:01:31Z","closed_at":"2019-10-26T21:01:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c201a267ea4601ccff028684a69affcc6638f54","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13617/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13617/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13617/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/16b7bc2f46d30aed0c7d7f7b1b8cb9090116b5fd","head":{"label":"JeremyNixon:dnnr","ref":"dnnr","sha":"16b7bc2f46d30aed0c7d7f7b1b8cb9090116b5fd","user":{"login":"JeremyNixon","id":4738024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzgwMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4738024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon","html_url":"https://github.com/JeremyNixon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50322139,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDMyMjEzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"JeremyNixon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JeremyNixon","id":4738024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzgwMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4738024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon","html_url":"https://github.com/JeremyNixon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremyNixon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JeremyNixon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nContinuousQueries have names that are unique across all the active ones. However, when queries are rapidly restarted with same name, it causes races conditions with the listener. A listener event from a stopped query can arrive after the query has been restarted, leading to complexities in monitoring infrastructure.\n\nAlong with this change, I have also consolidated all the messy code paths to start queries with different sinks.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit tests, and existing unit tests.\n","created_at":"2016-06-10T23:42:13Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T20:46:44Z","closed_at":"2016-06-13T20:46:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"340eb21a9980fe745db3a65753688d523574aa1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13613/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13613/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13613/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4971da3598685ab5c9c0274dda95412bc01bedfe","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-15889","ref":"SPARK-15889","sha":"4971da3598685ab5c9c0274dda95412bc01bedfe","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe way bash script `build/spark-build-info` is called from `core/pom.xml` prevents Spark building on Windows. Instead of calling the script directly we call `bash` and pass the script as an argument. This enables running it on Windows with bash installed which typically comes with Git.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nBuild tested on Windows 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.8

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nRight now, Spark 2.0 does not load hive-site.xml. Based on users' feedback, it seems make sense to still load this conf file.\n\nThis PR adds a `hadoopConf` API in `SharedState`, which is `sparkContext.hadoopConfiguration` by default. When users are under hive context, `SharedState.hadoopConf` will load hive-site.xml and append its configs to `sparkContext.hadoopConfiguration`.\n\nWhen we need to read hadoop config in spark sql, we should call `SessionState.newHadoopConf`, which contains `sparkContext.hadoopConfiguration`, hive-site.xml and sql configs.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew test in `HiveDataFrameSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-06-10T22:18:19Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T21:59:32Z","closed_at":"2016-06-13T21:59:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8fa2e0d70dcf187d3264195d78878ae175ec337a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13611/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13611/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13611/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8b53b226f0347c545bd13525d6d18bcf6f9a097e","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:hive-site","ref":"hive-site","sha":"8b53b226f0347c545bd13525d6d18bcf6f9a097e","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBefore this change, when you turn on blacklisting with `spark.scheduler.executorTaskBlacklistTime`, but you have fewer than `spark.task.maxFailures` executors, you can end with a job \"hung\" after some task failures.\n\nWhenever a taskset is unable to schedule anything on resourceOfferSingleTaskSet, we check whether the last pending task can be scheduled on _any_ known executor.  If not, the taskset (and any corresponding jobs) are failed.\n- Worst case, this is O(maxTaskFailures + numTasks).  But unless many executors are bad, this should be small\n- This does not fail as fast as possible -- when a task becomes unschedulable, we keep scheduling other tasks.  This is to avoid an O(numPendingTasks \\* numExecutors) operation\n- Also, it is conceivable this fails too quickly.  You may be 1 millisecond away from unblacklisting a place for a task to run, or acquiring a new executor.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit test which failed before the change, ran new test 5k times manually, ran all scheduler tests manually, and the full suite via jenkins.\n","created_at":"2016-06-10T16:55:29Z","updated_at":"2016-06-30T18:38:01Z","closed_at":"2016-06-30T18:38:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7b10370e457cd689a5c527f9bb9fd17c89955648","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13603/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13603/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13603/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ed413ceaecff8daa20c57e7272abb0f04ff6355c","head":{"label":"squito:progress_w_few_execs_and_blacklist","ref":"progress_w_few_execs_and_blacklist","sha":"ed413ceaecff8daa20c57e7272abb0f04ff6355c","user":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29212749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTIxMjc0OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"squito/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/squito/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nTo uncache a table, we have three different ways:\n- _SQL interface_: `UNCACHE TABLE`\n- _DataSet API_: `sparkSession.catalog.uncacheTable`\n- _DataSet API_: `sparkSession.table(tableName).unpersist()`\n\nWhen the table is not cached,\n- _SQL interface_: `UNCACHE TABLE non-cachedTable` -> **no error message**\n- _Dataset API_: `sparkSession.catalog.uncacheTable(\"non-cachedTable\")` -> **report a strange error message:**\n  `requirement failed: Table [a: int] is not cached`\n- _Dataset API_: `sparkSession.table(\"non-cachedTable\").unpersist()` -> **no error message**\n\nThis PR will make them consistent. No operation if the table has already been uncached.\n\nIn addition, this PR also removes `uncacheQuery` and renames `tryUncacheQuery` to `uncacheQuery`, and documents it that it's noop if the table has already been uncached\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nImproved the existing test case for verifying the cases when the table has not been cached.\nAlso added test cases for verifying the cases when the table does not exist\n","created_at":"2016-06-10T06:12:11Z","updated_at":"2016-06-14T18:46:44Z","closed_at":"2016-06-14T18:46:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7b06b8eb1e7fb0914d1246af3d0879e71f4c2328","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13593/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13593/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13593/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6999bd279bab6c7f501648f103f4b5757d9357a3","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:uncacheNonCachedTable","ref":"uncacheNonCachedTable","sha":"6999bd279bab6c7f501648f103f4b5757d9357a3","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe typical query may looks like: (part1 is the partition key)\n\n``` sql\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE (part1 = 1 AND id > 12) OR (part1 = 5 AND id < 100)\n```\n\nCurrently, Spark will ignore the partition key in the disjunction, and causes full table scan, however, only 2 partitions required. This PR aims to drop the non-partition keys from the filter and try to extract the partition key expressions for partition pruning.\n\nFor instance:\n\n``` scala\n(part1 = 1 AND id > 12) OR (part1 = 5 AND id < 100) ==> (part1 = 1) OR (part1 = 5)\n(part1 = 1 AND a > 3) OR (part2 = 2 AND a < 5)  ==> (part1 = 1 or part1 = 2)\n(part1 = 1 AND a > 3) OR (a < 100) => None\n(a > 100 AND b < 100) OR (part1 = 10) => None\n(a > 100 AND b < 100 AND part1 = 10) OR (part1 = 2) => (part1 = 10 or part1 = 2)\n```\n\nThis PR will only works for the HiveTableScan, will submit another PR to optimize the data source API back-end scan.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe unit test is also included in this PR.\n","created_at":"2016-06-10T01:06:50Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T01:30:11Z","closed_at":"2017-06-15T01:30:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"89c1f7012d9205790b2736db0bff512e74345ab5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13585/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13585/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13585/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/79f7acbb660c2c398e21a36a7b92f316b7e5037f","head":{"label":"chenghao-intel:partition","ref":"partition","sha":"79f7acbb660c2c398e21a36a7b92f316b7e5037f","user":{"login":"chenghao-intel","id":2367031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjcwMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2367031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel","html_url":"https://github.com/chenghao-intel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18098468,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODA5ODQ2OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"chenghao-intel/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chenghao-intel","id":2367031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjcwMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2367031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel","html_url":"https://github.com/chenghao-intel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chenghao-intel/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently in SparkR, when you load a LibSVM dataset using the sqlContext and then pass it to an MLlib algorithm, the ML wrappers will fail since they will try to create a \"features\" column, which conflicts with the existing \"features\" column from the LibSVM loader. E.g., using the \"mnist\" dataset from LibSVM:\n`training <- loadDF(sqlContext, \".../mnist\", \"libsvm\")`\n`model <- naiveBayes(label ~ features, training)`\nThis fails with:\n\n```\n16/05/24 11:52:41 ERROR RBackendHandler: fit on org.apache.spark.ml.r.NaiveBayesWrapper failed\nError in invokeJava(isStatic = TRUE, className, methodName, ...) : \n  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Output

column once you rename the \"features\" column.\n```\n\nThe cause is, when using `loadDF()` to generate dataframes, sometimes it’s with default column name `“label”` and `“features”`, and these two name will conflict with default column names `setDefault(labelCol, \"label\")` and `setDefault(featuresCol, \"features\")` of `SharedParams.scala`\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTest on my local

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe current implementations of `UnixTime` and `FromUnixTime` do not cache their parser/formatter as much as they could. This PR resolved this issue.\n\nThis PR is a take over from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13522 and further optimizes the re-use of the parser/formatter. It also fixes the improves handling (catching the actual exception instead of `Throwable`). All credits for this work should go to @rajeshbalamohan.\n\nThis PR closes https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13522\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nCurrent

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDuring history server startup, the spark configuration is examined. If security.authentication is\r\nset, log at debug and set the value to false, so that {{SecurityManager}} can be created.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA new test in `HistoryServerSuite` sets the `spark.authenticate` property to true, tries to create a security manager via a new package-private method `HistoryServer.createSecurityManager(SparkConf)`. This is the method used in `HistoryServer.main`. All other instantiations of a security manager in `HistoryServerSuite` have been switched to the new method, for consistency with the production code.\r\n","created_at":"2016-06-09T16:21:16Z","updated_at":"2016-12-12T21:08:57Z","closed_at":"2016-12-12T20:27:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3eda718763277b05bdbb620e9bd5b4513326ff2d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13579/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13579/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13579/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/033f21e8799584c89d5bbac8692765624695b5b3","head":{"label":"steveloughran:history/SPARK-15844-security","ref":"history/SPARK-15844-security","sha":"033f21e8799584c89d5bbac8692765624695b5b3","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32387210,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM4NzIxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"steveloughran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds support for writing in `csv`, `json`, `text` formats in Structured Streaming:\n\n**1. at a high level, this patch forms the following hierarchy**(`text` as an example):\n\n```\n                <OutputWriter>\n                      ↑\n             TextOutputWriterBase\n                 ↗          ↖\nBatchTextOutputWriter   StreamingTextOutputWriter\n```\n\n```\n                    <OutputWriterFactory>\n                        ↗          ↖\nBatchTextOutputWriterFactory   StreamingOutputWriterFactory\n                                              ↑\n                              StreamingTextOutputWriterFactory\n```\n\nThe `StreamingTextOutputWriter` and other 'streaming' output writers would write data **without** using an `OutputCommitter`. This was the same approach taken by [SPARK-14716](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12409).\n\n**2. to support compression, this patch attaches an extension to the path assigned by `FileStreamSink`**, which is slightly different from [SPARK-14716](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12409). For example, if we are writing out using the `gzip` compression and `FileStreamSink` assigns path `${uuid}` to a text writer, then in the end the file written out will be `${uuid}.txt.gz` -- so that when we read the file back, we'll correctly interpret it as `gzip` compressed.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n`FileStreamSinkSuite` is expanded much more to cover the added `csv`, `json`, `text` formats:\n\n``` scala\ntest(\" csv - unpartitioned data - codecs: none/gzip\")\ntest(\"json - unpartitioned data - codecs: none/gzip\")\ntest(\"text - unpartitioned data - codecs: none/gzip\")\n\ntest(\" csv - partitioned data - codecs: none/gzip\")\ntest(\"json - partitioned data - codecs: none/gzip\")\ntest(\"text - partitioned data - codecs: none/gzip\")\n\ntest(\" csv - unpartitioned writing and batch reading - codecs: none/gzip\")\ntest(\"json - unpartitioned writing and batch reading - codecs: none/gzip\")\ntest(\"text - unpartitioned writing and batch reading - codecs: none/gzip\")\n\ntest(\" csv - partitioned writing and batch reading - codecs: none/gzip\")\ntest(\"json - partitioned writing and batch reading - codecs: none/gzip\")\ntest(\"text - partitioned writing and batch reading - codecs:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIt looks like the nightly Maven snapshots broke after we set `JAVA_7_HOME` in the build: https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20Packaging/job/spark-master-maven-snapshots/1573/. It seems that passing `-javabootclasspath` to ScalaDoc using scala-maven-plugin ends up preventing the Scala library classes from being added to scalac's internal class path, causing compilation errors while building doc-jars.\n\nThere might be a principled fix to this inside of the scala-maven-plugin itself, but for now this patch configures the build to omit the `-javabootclasspath` option during Maven doc-jar generation.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested manually with `build/mvn clean install -DskipTests=true` when `JAVA_7_HOME` was set. Also manually inspected the effective POM diff to verify that the final POM changes were scoped correctly: https://gist.github.com/JoshRosen/f889d1c236fad14fa25ac4be01654653\n\n/cc @vanzin and @yhuai

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n~~If the temp table already exists, we should not silently replace it when doing `CACHE TABLE AS SELECT`. This is inconsistent with the behavior of `CREAT VIEW` or `CREATE TABLE`. This PR is to fix this silent drop.~~\n\n~~Maybe, we also can introduce new syntax for replacing the existing one. For example, in Hive, to replace a view, the syntax should be like `ALTER VIEW AS SELECT` or `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW AS SELECT`~~\n\nThe table name in `CACHE TABLE AS SELECT` should NOT contain database prefix like \"database.table\". Thus, this PR captures this in Parser and outputs a better error message, instead of reporting the view already exists.\n\nIn addition, refactoring the `Parser` to generate table identifiers instead of returning the table name string.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n- Added a test case for caching and uncaching qualified table names\n- Fixed a few test cases that do not drop temp table at the end\n- Added the related test case for the issue resolved in this PR\n","created_at":"2016-06-09T06:32:02Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T17:04:15Z","closed_at":"2016-06-16T17:04:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9cce1555b306f13e85798eced88c731c930ba1cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13572/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13572/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13572/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/191889c2dd5acbb856a42553d34c5bceefcdd5ff","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:cacheTableAsSelect","ref":"cacheTableAsSelect","sha":"191889c2dd5acbb856a42553d34c5bceefcdd5ff","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

is an early work in progress / RFC PR to see what interest exists / thoughts are around offering Jython for some PySpark UDF evaluation.\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nTransferring data from the JVM to the Python executor can be a substantial bottleneck. While Jython is not suitable for all UDFs or map functions, it may be suitable for some simple ones. An early draft of this, with a tokenization UDF, found Jython UDF to be ~65% faster than Python UDF and ~2% slower than a native Scala UDF for multiple runs. The first run with a Jython UDF involves starting the Jython interpreter on the workers, but even in those cases it outperforms regular PySpark UDFs by ~20%.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nunit tests, doc tests, and benchmark (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L-F12nVWSLEOW72sqOn6Mt1C0bcPFP9ck7gEMH2_IXE/edit?usp=sharing

existential sub-query predicate contains another embedded sub-query predicate, the RewritePredicateSubquery optimizer rule does not resolve the embedded sub-query expressions into existential joins.For example, the above query has the following optimized plan, which fails during physical plan build.\n\n``` SQL\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\nProject [_1#224 AS c1#227]\n+- Join LeftSemi, (CASE WHEN predicate-subquery#255 [(_2#225 = c2#239)] THEN 2 ELSE 3 END = c2#228#262)\n   :  +- SubqueryAlias predicate-subquery#255 [(_2#225 = c2#239)]\n   :     +- LocalRelation [c2#239]\n   :- LocalRelation [_1#224, _2#225]\n   +- LocalRelation [c2#228#262]\n\n== Physical Plan ==\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.errors.package$TreeNodeException: Binding attribute, tree: c2#239\n```\n\n**Solution:**\nIn RewritePredicateSubquery, before rewriting the outermost predicate sub-query, resolve any embedded existential sub-queries. The Optimized plan for the above query after the changes looks like below.\n\n``` SQL\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\nProject [_1#224 AS c1#227]\n+- Join LeftSemi, (CASE WHEN exists#285 THEN 2 ELSE 3 END = c2#228#284)\n   :- Join ExistenceJoin(exists#285), (_2#225 = c2#239)\n   :  :- LocalRelation [_1#224, _2#225]\n   :  +- LocalRelation [c2#239]\n   +- LocalRelation [c2#228#284]\n\n== Physical Plan ==\n*Project [_1#224 AS c1#227]\n+- *BroadcastHashJoin [CASE WHEN exists#285 THEN 2 ELSE 3 END], [c2#228#284], LeftSemi, BuildRight\n   :- *BroadcastHashJoin [_2#225], [c2#239],

patch fixes a bug in `./dev/test-dependencies.sh` which caused spurious failures when the script was run on a machine with an empty `.m2` cache. The problem was that extra log output from the dependency download was conflicting with the grep / regex used to identify the classpath in the Maven output. This patch fixes this issue by adjusting the regex pattern.\n\nTested manually with the following reproduction of the bug:\n\n```\nrm -rf

adding support for `REFRESH path` that invalidates and refreshes all the cached data (and the associated metadata) for any dataframe that contains the given data source path.\n\nExpected behavior:\n\n``` scala\nval dir = \"/tmp/test\"\nsqlContext.range(1000).write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(dir)\nval df = sqlContext.read.parquet(dir).cache()\ndf.count() // outputs

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThree changes here -- first two were causing failures w/ BlacklistIntegrationSuite\n1. The testing framework didn't include the reviveOffers thread, so the test which involved delay scheduling might never submit offers late enough for the delay scheduling to kick in.  So added in the periodic revive offers, just like the real scheduler.\n2. `assertEmptyDataStructures` would occasionally fail, because it appeared there was still an active job.  This is because in DAGScheduler, the jobWaiter is notified of the job completion before the data structures are cleaned up.  Most of the time the test code that is waiting on the jobWaiter won't become active until after the data structures are cleared, but occasionally the race goes the other way, and the assertions fail.\n3. `DAGSchedulerSuite` was not stopping all the inner parts it was setting up, so each test was leaking a number of threads.  So we stop those parts too.\n4. Turns out that `assertMapOutputAvailable` is not terribly useful in this framework -- most of the places I was trying to use it suffer from some race.\n5. When there is an exception in the backend, try to improve the error msg a little bit.  Before the exception was printed to the console, but the test would fail w/ a timeout, and the logs wouldn't show anything.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI ran all the tests in `BlacklistIntegrationSuite` 5k times and everything in `DAGSchedulerSuite` 1k times on my laptop.  Also I ran a full jenkins build with `BlacklistIntegrationSuite` 500 times and `DAGSchedulerSuite` 50 times, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13548.  (I tried more times but jenkins timed out.)\n\nTo check for more leaked threads, I added some code to dump the list of all threads at the end of each test in DAGSchedulerSuite, which is how I discovered the mapOutputTracker and eventLoop were leaking threads.  (I removed that code from the final pr, just part of the testing.)\n\nAnd I'll run Jenkins on this a couple of times to do one more

SBT build currently uses a fork of the sbt-pom-reader plugin but depends on that fork via a SBT subproject which is cloned from https://github.com/scrapcodes/sbt-pom-reader/tree/ignore_artifact_id. This unnecessarily slows down the initial build on fresh machines and is also risky because it risks a build breakage in case that GitHub repository ever changes or is deleted.\n\nIn order to address these issues, I have published a pre-built binary of our forked sbt-pom-reader plugin to Maven Central under the `org.spark-project` namespace and have updated Spark's build to use that artifact. This published artifact was built from https://github.com/JoshRosen/sbt-pom-reader/tree/v1.0.0-spark, which contains the contents of @ScrapCodes's branch plus an additional patch to configure the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe help function 'toStructType' in the AttributeSeq class doesn't include the metadata when it builds the StructField, so it causes this reported problem https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15804?jql=project%20%3D%20SPARK when spark writes the the dataframe with the metadata to the parquet datasource.  \n\nThe code path is when spark writes the dataframe to the parquet datasource through the InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand, spark will build the WriteRelation container, and it will call the help function 'toStructType' to create StructType which contains StructField, it should include the metadata there, otherwise, we will lost the user provide metadata. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nadded test case in ParquetQuerySuite.scala\n\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove this)\n","created_at":"2016-06-08T07:27:28Z","updated_at":"2016-06-09T16:52:06Z","closed_at":"2016-06-09T16:52:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e19b2f71b1c3af618039d5f22ab5c1fa1ab79f40","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13555/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13555/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13555/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/229ca27bb376452127c40345210c99105f6ceee3","head":{"label":"kevinyu98:spark-15804","ref":"spark-15804","sha":"229ca27bb376452127c40345210c99105f6ceee3","user":{"login":"kevinyu98","id":7550280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTAyODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7550280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinyu98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38393679,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODM5MzY3OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"kevinyu98/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kevinyu98","id":7550280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTAyODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7550280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinyu98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kevinyu98/spark","description":"Mirror

`DatasetAggregatorSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-06-08T06:02:29Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T17:00:53Z","closed_at":"2016-06-13T17:00:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"494b95488fbafdb163669d9a2781d5e7242d5af7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13553/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13553/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13553/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/34711996028e595a3e42d373a03594404f364802","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:agg-null","ref":"agg-null","sha":"34711996028e595a3e42d373a03594404f364802","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen the output mode is complete, then the output of a streaming aggregation essentially will contain the complete aggregates every time. So this is not different from a batch dataset within an incremental execution. Other non-streaming operations should be supported on this dataset. In this PR, I am just adding support for sorting, as it is a common useful functionality. Support for other operations will come later.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdditional unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhole stage codegen often creates `isNull` variable initialized with constant _false_, like\n`boolean mapelements_isNull = false || false;`\n\nIf there is no further assignment for this `isNull` variable, whole stage codegen can do more optimizations by assuming `isNull` as a compile-time constant.\n\nIn the example below, which is generated for a dataset map operation, `mapelements_isNull` defined at line 115 can be assumed by a compile-time constant (false). \nBy assuming this as a constant, the whole stage codegen eliminates `zeroOutNullBytes` at line 119 and an if-statement at line 121.\nIn addition to the benefits of improved readability of generated code, eliminating `zeroOutNullBytes` will give performance advantage since it is difficult to remove for Java JIT compiler.\n\nwithout this patch\n\n```\n/* 107 */       // CONSUME: Project [id#0L AS l#3L]\n/* 108 */       // CONSUME: DeserializeToObject l#3: bigint,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWith very wide tables, e.g. thousands of fields, the plan output is unreadable and often causes OOMs due to inefficient string processing. This truncates all struct and operator field lists to a user configurable threshold to limit performance impact.\n\nIt would also be nice to optimize string generation to avoid these sort of O(n^2) slowdowns entirely (i.e. use StringBuilder everywhere including expressions), but this is probably too large of a change for 2.0 at this point, and truncation has other benefits for usability.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a microbenchmark that covers this case particularly well. I also ran the microbenchmark while varying the truncation threshold.\n\n```\nnumFields = 5\nwide shallowly nested struct field r/w:  Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR makes sure the typed Filter doesn't change the Dataset schema.\n\n**Before the change:**\n\n```\nscala> val df = spark.range(0,9)\nscala> df.schema\nres12: org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType = StructType(StructField(id,LongType,false))\nscala> val afterFilter = df.filter(_=>true)\nscala> afterFilter.schema   // !!! schema is CHANGED!!! Column name is changed from id to value, nullable is changed from false to true.\nres13: org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType = StructType(StructField(value,LongType,true))\n\n```\n\nSerializeFromObject and DeserializeToObject are inserted to wrap the Filter, and these two can possibly change the schema of Dataset.\n\n**After the change:**\n\n```\nscala> afterFilter.schema   // schema is NOT changed.\nres47: org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType = StructType(StructField(id,LongType,false))\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen `--packages` is specified with `spark-shell` the classes from those packages cannot be found, which I think is due to some of the changes in `SPARK-12343`. In particular `SPARK-12343` removes a line that sets the `spark.jars` system property in client mode, which is used by the repl main class to set the classpath.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested manually.\n\nThis system property is used by the repl to populate its classpath. If\nthis is not set properly the classes for external packages cannot be\nfound.\n\n@tgravescs @vanzin as you may be familiar with this part of the code.\n","created_at":"2016-06-06T16:55:28Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T21:28:45Z","closed_at":"2016-06-15T21:09:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b9d7fa3ff60ef224f8566b7ac7d84e2dd19dae00","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13527/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13527/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13527/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c4be22bd01684172bb0d1981c0f07d5305be545e","head":{"label":"nezihyigitbasi:repl-fix","ref":"repl-fix","sha":"c4be22bd01684172bb0d1981c0f07d5305be545e","user":{"login":"nezihyigitbasi","id":1223839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM4Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi","html_url":"https://github.com/nezihyigitbasi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51940309,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTk0MDMwOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"nezihyigitbasi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nezihyigitbasi","id":1223839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM4Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi","html_url":"https://github.com/nezihyigitbasi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nezihyigitbasi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nezihyigitbasi/spark","description":"Mirror
