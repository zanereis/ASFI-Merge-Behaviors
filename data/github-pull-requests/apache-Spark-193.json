What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTO FIX flaky tests:\r\n\r\nhttps://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/132345/testReport/\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.HiveThriftHttpServerSuite.JDBC query

float\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe root cause here is a jar conflict issue.\r\n`NewCookie.isHttpOnly` is not defined in the `jsr311-api.jar` which conflicts\r\nThe transitive artifact `jsr311-api.jar` of `hadoop-client` is excluded at the maven side. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27179.\r\n\r\nThe Jenkins PR builder and Github Action use `SBT` as the compiler tool.\r\n\r\nFirst, the exclusion rule from maven is not followed by sbt, so I was able to see `jsr311-api.jar` from maven cache to be added to the classpath directly. **This seems to be a  bug of `sbt-pom-reader` plugin but I'm not that sure.**\r\n\r\nThen I added an `ExcludeRule` for the `hive-thriftserver` module at the SBT side and did see the `jsr311-api.jar` gone, but the CI jobs still failed with the same error.\r\n\r\nI added a trace log in ThriftHttpServlet\r\n\r\n```s\r\nERROR ThriftHttpServlet: !!!!!!!!! Suspect???????? --->\r\nfile:/home/jenkins/workspace/SparkPullRequestBuilder/assembly/target/scala-2.12/jars/jsr311-api-1.1.1.jar\r\n```\r\nAnd the log pointed out that the assembly phase copied it to `assembly/target/scala-2.12/jars/` which will be added to the classpath too. With the help of SBT `dependencyTree` tool, I saw the `jsr311-api` again as a transitive of `jersery-core` from `yarn` module with a `test` scope. So **This seems to be another bug from the SBT side of the `sbt-assembly` plugin.**  It copied a test scope transitive artifact to the assembly output.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I defined some rules in SparkBuild.scala to bypass the potential bugs from the SBT side.\r\n\r\nFirst, exclude the `jsr311` from all over the project and then add it back separately to the YARN module for SBT.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the HiveThriftServerSuites was reflected for reducing flakiness too, but not related to the bugs I have found so far.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7.

But for\r\nCTAS, if the sub-query can't be resolved, preprocess it will cause \"Invalid call to toAttribute on unresolved\r\nobject\" (instead of a user-friendly error msg: \"table or view not found\").\r\nThis PR fixes this wrongly preprocess for CTAS using V2 catalog.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nbug fix\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe error message for CTAS with a non-exists table changed from:\r\n`UnresolvedException: Invalid call to toAttribute on unresolved object, tree: xxx` to\r\n`AnalysisException: Table or view not found: xxx`\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR introduces `UnresolvedView` in the resolution framework to resolve the identifier.\r\n\r\nThis PR then migrates `DROP VIEW` to use `UnresolvedView` to resolve the table/view identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo use `UnresolvedView` for view resolution. Note that there is no resolution behavior change with this PR.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR removes `-Djava.version=11` from the build command for Scala 2.13 in the GitHub Actions' job.\r\n\r\nIn the GitHub Actions' job, the build command for Scala 2.13 is defined as follows.\r\n```\r\n./build/sbt -Pyarn -Pmesos -Pkubernetes -Phive -Phive-thriftserver -Phadoop-cloud -Pkinesis-asl -Djava.version=11 -Pscala-2.13 compile test:compile\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough, Scala 2.13 build uses Java 8 rather than 11 so let's remove `-Djava.version=11`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo build with consistent configuration.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nShould be done by GitHub Actions'

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPreprocess the partition spec passed to the V1 SHOW PARTITIONS implementation `ShowPartitionsCommand`, and normalize the passed spec according to the partition columns w.r.t the case sensitivity flag  **spark.sql.caseSensitive**.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nV1 SHOW PARTITIONS is case sensitive in fact, and doesn't respect the SQL config **spark.sql.caseSensitive** which is false by default, for instance:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE tbl1 (price int, qty int, year int, month int)\r\n         > USING parquet\r\n         > PARTITIONED BY (year, month);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO tbl1 PARTITION(year = 2015, month = 1) SELECT 1, 1;\r\nspark-sql> SHOW PARTITIONS tbl1 PARTITION(YEAR = 2015, Month = 1);\r\nError in query: Non-partitioning column(s) [YEAR, Month] are specified for SHOW PARTITIONS;\r\n```\r\nThe `SHOW PARTITIONS` command must show the partition `year = 2015, month = 1` specified by `YEAR = 2015, Month = 1`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the command above works as expected:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SHOW PARTITIONS tbl1 PARTITION(YEAR = 2015, Month = 1);\r\nyear=2015/month=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.HiveCatalogedDDLSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2020-12-06T16:01:48Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T20:29:32Z","closed_at":"2020-12-06T22:24:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c876489d1416de22be6121aa8c059e0eb4f871ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30627/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30627/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30627/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e45f11b1df9d733065a1b282fc39cacb6da1489b","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:show-partitions-case-sensitivity-test-2.4","ref":"show-partitions-case-sensitivity-test-2.4","sha":"e45f11b1df9d733065a1b282fc39cacb6da1489b","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPreprocess the partition spec passed to the V1 SHOW PARTITIONS implementation `ShowPartitionsCommand`, and normalize the passed spec according to the partition columns w.r.t the case sensitivity flag  **spark.sql.caseSensitive**.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nV1 SHOW PARTITIONS is case sensitive in fact, and doesn't respect the SQL config **spark.sql.caseSensitive** which is false by default, for instance:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE tbl1 (price int, qty int, year int, month int)\r\n         > USING parquet\r\n         > PARTITIONED BY (year, month);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO tbl1 PARTITION(year = 2015, month = 1) SELECT 1, 1;\r\nspark-sql> SHOW PARTITIONS tbl1 PARTITION(YEAR = 2015, Month = 1);\r\nError in query: Non-partitioning column(s) [YEAR, Month] are specified for SHOW PARTITIONS;\r\n```\r\nThe `SHOW PARTITIONS` command must show the partition `year = 2015, month = 1` specified by `YEAR = 2015, Month = 1`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the command above works as expected:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SHOW PARTITIONS tbl1 PARTITION(YEAR = 2015, Month = 1);\r\nyear=2015/month=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.HiveCatalogedDDLSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2020-12-06T15:48:08Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T20:29:33Z","closed_at":"2020-12-06T22:22:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"006e19c50a1ca01d85412b73a40e155b43cbd408","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30626/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30626/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30626/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ff7bf27b4c2a8e5215579bfc5f524aa8b2edd301","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:show-partitions-case-sensitivity-test-3.0","ref":"show-partitions-case-sensitivity-test-3.0","sha":"ff7bf27b4c2a8e5215579bfc5f524aa8b2edd301","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

To have the same behavior as V1 `ALTER TABLE ..

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `GitHub Action` job to publish daily snapshot for **master** branch.\r\n- https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots/org/apache/spark/spark-core_2.12/3.2.0-SNAPSHOT/\r\n\r\nFor the other branches, I'll make adjusted backports.\r\n- For `branch-3.1`, we can specify the checkout `ref` to `branch-3.1`.\r\n- For `branch-2.4` and `branch-3.0`, we can publish at every commit since the traffic is low.\r\n  - https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30630 (branch-3.0)\r\n  - https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30629 (branch-2.4 LTS)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAfter this series of jobs, this will reduce our maintenance burden permanently from AmpLab Jenkins by removing the following completely.\r\n\r\nhttps://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20Packaging/\r\n\r\nFor now, AmpLab Jenkins doesn't have a job for `branch-3.1`. We can do it by ourselves by `GitHub Action`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe snapshot publishing is tested here at PR trigger. Since this PR adds a scheduled job, we cannot test in this PR.\r\n- https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark/runs/1505792859\r\n\r\nApache Infra team finished the setup here.\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds few lines about docstring style to document that PySpark follows [NumPy documentation style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html). We all completed the migration to NumPy documentation style at SPARK-32085.\r\n\r\nIdeally we should have a page like https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/contributing_docstring.html but I would like to leave it as a future work.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo tell developers that PySpark now follows NumPy documentation style.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's a change in unreleased branches yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested via `make clean html` under `python/docs`:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is to show Slowpoke notifications in the log when running tests using SBT.\r\n\r\nFor example, the test case \"zero sized blocks\" in ExternalShuffleServiceSuite enters the infinite loop. After this change, the log file will have a notification message every 5 minute when the test case running longer than two minutes. Below is an example message. \r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] ExternalShuffleServiceSuite:\r\n[info] - groupByKey without compression (101 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - shuffle non-zero block size (3 seconds, 186 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - shuffle serializer (3 seconds, 189 milliseconds)\r\n[info] *** Test still running after 2 minute, 1 seconds: suite name: ExternalShuffleServiceSuite, test name: zero sized blocks. \r\n[info] *** Test still running after 7 minute, 1 seconds: suite name: ExternalShuffleServiceSuite, test name: zero sized blocks. \r\n[info] *** Test still running after 12 minutes, 1 seconds: suite name: ExternalShuffleServiceSuite, test name: zero sized blocks. \r\n[info] *** Test still running after 17 minutes, 1 seconds: suite name: ExternalShuffleServiceSuite, test name: zero sized blocks. \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen the tests/code has bug and enters the infinite loop, it is hard to tell which test cases hit some issues from the log, especially when we are running the tests in parallel. It would be nice to show the Slowpoke notifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual testing in my local dev environment.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-06T04:30:01Z","updated_at":"2020-12-06T14:38:00Z","closed_at":"2020-12-06T14:37:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"060c8c20d6dce5dc5187ddf636e93d4e8722d16d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30621/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30621/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30621/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f8b7b783f94dc6fd764e3eac92c7602a22b48760","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:addSlowpoke","ref":"addSlowpoke","sha":"f8b7b783f94dc6fd764e3eac92c7602a22b48760","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

It would be great to avoid using a global executorSourceLocalModeOnly to save a state of a specific executor. Can we move this to SparkEnv so that a state of one test won't be leaked to other tests?\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR moves `executorSourceLocalModeOnly` from Executor to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change make InterruptedIOException to be treated as InterruptedException when closing YarnClientSchedulerBackend, which doesn't log error with \"YARN application has exited unexpectedly xxx\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor YarnClient mode, when stopping YarnClientSchedulerBackend, it first tries to interrupt Yarn application monitor thread. In MonitorThread.run() it catches InterruptedException to gracefully response to stopping request.\r\n\r\nBut client.monitorApplication method also throws InterruptedIOException when the hadoop rpc call is calling. In this case, MonitorThread will not know it is interrupted, a Yarn App failed is returned with \"Failed to contact YARN for application xxxxx;  YARN application has exited unexpectedly with state xxxxx\" is logged with error level. which confuse user a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nvery simple patch, seems no

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPreprocess the partition spec passed to the V1 SHOW PARTITIONS implementation `ShowPartitionsCommand`, and normalize the passed spec according to the partition columns w.r.t the case sensitivity flag  **spark.sql.caseSensitive**.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nV1 SHOW PARTITIONS is case sensitive in fact, and doesn't respect the SQL config **spark.sql.caseSensitive** which is false by default, for instance:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE tbl1 (price int, qty int, year int, month int)\r\n         > USING parquet\r\n         > PARTITIONED BY (year, month);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO tbl1 PARTITION(year = 2015, month = 1) SELECT 1, 1;\r\nspark-sql> SHOW PARTITIONS tbl1 PARTITION(YEAR = 2015, Month = 1);\r\nError in query: Non-partitioning column(s) [YEAR, Month] are specified for SHOW PARTITIONS;\r\n```\r\nThe `SHOW PARTITIONS` command must show the partition `year = 2015, month = 1` specified by `YEAR = 2015, Month = 1`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the command above works as expected:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SHOW PARTITIONS tbl1 PARTITION(YEAR = 2015, Month = 1);\r\nyear=2015/month=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n- `v1/ShowPartitionsSuite`\r\n- `v2/ShowPartitionsSuite`","created_at":"2020-12-05T07:19:47Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T15:04:03Z","closed_at":"2020-12-06T10:56:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d957bd4e1b25d2620c49fb35857acbc423f9e144","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30615/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30615/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30615/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/603823a31291491914fd4a9548ac558b6e0a9d71","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:show-partitions-case-sensitivity-test","ref":"show-partitions-case-sensitivity-test","sha":"603823a31291491914fd4a9548ac558b6e0a9d71","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSuggest users using Datetime conversion functions in the error message of invalid ANSI explicit casting.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn ANSI mode, explicit cast between DateTime types and Numeric types is not allowed.\r\nAs of now, we have introduced new functions `UNIX_SECONDS`/`UNIX_MILLIS`/`UNIX_MICROS`/`UNIX_DATE`/`DATE_FROM_UNIX_DATE`, we can show suggestions to users so that they can complete these type conversions precisely and easily in ANSI mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, better error messages\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR add an option to keep container after DockerJDBCIntegrationSuites (e.g. DB2IntegrationSuite, PostgresIntegrationSuite) finish.\r\nBy setting a system property `spark.test.docker.keepContainer` to `true`, we can use this option.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf some error occur during the tests, it would be useful to keep the container for debug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, when a client requests FETCH_PRIOR to Thriftserver, Thriftserver reiterates from the start position. Because Thriftserver caches a query result with an array when THRIFTSERVER_INCREMENTAL_COLLECT feature is off, FETCH_PRIOR can be implemented without reiterating the result. A trait FeatureIterator is added in order to separate the implementation for iterator and an array. Also, FeatureIterator supports moves cursor with absolute position, which will be useful for the implementation of FETCH_RELATIVE, FETCH_ABSOLUTE.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor better performance of Thriftserver.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis changes `DeleteFromTableExec` to also refresh caches referencing the original table, by passing the `refreshCache` callback to the class. Note that in order to construct the callback, I have to change `DataSourceV2ScanRelation` to contain a `DataSourceV2Relation` instead of a `Table`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently DSv2 delete from table doesn't refresh caches. This could lead to correctness issue if the staled cache is queried later.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Now delete from table in v2 also refreshes cache.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a test case.","created_at":"2020-12-04T01:18:02Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:53:30Z","closed_at":"2020-12-06T09:14:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"486d958e2f90a94feaa42706440ba60a04a2daa4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30597/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30597/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30597/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eb5646fd21aeb4e1e65aa8307eb398a2f5fba0e7","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-33652","ref":"SPARK-33652","sha":"eb5646fd21aeb4e1e65aa8307eb398a2f5fba0e7","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR removes the restriction and allows CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE with LOCATION for data source tables. It also moves the check from the analyzer rule `ResolveSessionCatalog` to `SessionCatalog`, so that v2 session catalog can overwrite it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's an unnecessary behavior difference that Hive serde table can be created with `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` if LOCATION is present, while data source table doesn't allow `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` at all.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ... USING ... LOCATION ...` is allowed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

ADD/DROP PARTITION` command, and perform the general check (does the table support partition management at all) before specific checks.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe error message for the table which doesn't support partition management can mislead users:\r\n```java\r\nPartitionSpecs are not resolved;;\r\n'AlterTableAddPartition [UnresolvedPartitionSpec(Map(id -> 1),None)], false\r\n+- ResolvedTable org.apache.spark.sql.connector.InMemoryTableCatalog@2fd64b11, ns1.ns2.tbl, org.apache.spark.sql.connector.InMemoryTable@5d3ff859\r\n```\r\nbecause it says nothing about the root cause of the issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the change, the error message will be:\r\n```\r\nTable ns1.ns2.tbl can not alter partitions\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suite

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd new functions DATE_FROM_UNIX_DATE and UNIX_DATE for conversion between Date type and Numeric types.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. Explicit conversion between Date type and Numeric types is disallowed in ANSI mode. We need to provide new functions for users to complete the conversion.\r\n\r\n2. We have introduced new functions from Bigquery for conversion between Timestamp type and Numeric types: TIMESTAMP_SECONDS, TIMESTAMP_MILLIS, TIMESTAMP_MICROS , UNIX_SECONDS, UNIX_MILLIS, and UNIX_MICROS. It makes sense to add functions for conversion between Date type and Numeric types as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, two new datetime functions are added.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR extends the connection timeout to the DB server for DB2IntegrationSuite and its variants.\r\n\r\nThe container image ibmcom/db2 creates a database when it starts up.\r\nThe database creation can take over 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nDB2IntegrationSuite and its variants use the container image but the connection timeout is set to 2 minutes so these suites almost always fail.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make `spark.archives` configuration working in Kubernates.\r\nIt works without a problem in standalone cluster but there seems a bug in Kubernates.\r\nIt fails to fetch the file on the driver side as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n20/12/03 13:33:53 INFO SparkContext: Added JAR

correctly. The changes here fix it by adding and resolving URIs correctly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`spark.archives` feature can be leveraged for many things such as Conda support. We should make it working in Kubernates as well.\r\nThis is a bug fix too.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this feature is not out yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI manually tested with Minikube 1.15.1. For an environment issue (?), I had to use a custom namespace, service account and roles. `default` service account does not work for me and complains it doesn't have permissions to get/list pods, etc.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nminikube delete\r\nminikube start --cpus 12 --memory 16384\r\nkubectl create namespace spark-integration-test\r\ncat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a followup to add missing `labelsArray` to PySpark `StringIndexer`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`labelsArray` is for multi-column case for `StringIndexer`. We should provide this accessor at PySpark side too.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, `labelsArray` was missing in PySpark `StringIndexer` in Spark 3.0.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a followup to add missing `labelsArray` to PySpark `StringIndexer`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a way to inject data source rewrite rules.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRight now `SparkSessionExtensions` allow us to inject optimization rules but they are added to operator optimization batch. There are cases when users need to run rules after the operator optimization batch (e.g. cases when a rule relies on the fact that expressions have been optimized). Currently, this is not possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR comes with a new test.","created_at":"2020-12-02T21:24:36Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T23:32:36Z","closed_at":"2020-12-07T23:32:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"db1e3a9620c47e8a04c191f2b65cf1fb9570edb5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30577/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30577/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30577/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6b38928a7a72862a9b2408dfc931d0ef5961b466","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:spark-33621-v3","ref":"spark-33621-v3","sha":"6b38928a7a72862a9b2408dfc931d0ef5961b466","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30289. It removes the hack in `View.effectiveSQLConf`, by putting the max nested view depth in `AnalysisContext`. Then we don't get the max nested view depth from the active SQLConf, which keeps changing during nested view resolution.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nremove hacks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nIf I just remove the hack, `SimpleSQLViewSuite.restrict the nested level of a view` fails. With this fix, it passes again.","created_at":"2020-12-02T17:01:15Z","updated_at":"2020-12-04T22:47:05Z","closed_at":"2020-12-04T14:01:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"521c1b50368a231eecf31ab0f81648bb63101718","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30575/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30575/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30575/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/82e50297ae797e4a0d724538c6c57ffad1a7f9ed","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:view","ref":"view","sha":"82e50297ae797e4a0d724538c6c57ffad1a7f9ed","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen partitions are tracked by the catalog, that will compute all custom partition locations, especially when dynamic partitions, and the field staticPartitions is empty.\r\n\r\nThe poor performance of the method listPartitions results in a long period of no response at the Driver.\r\n\r\nFor example in InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nif (partitionsTrackedByCatalog) {\r\n  matchingPartitions = sparkSession.sessionState.catalog.listPartitions(\r\n    catalogTable.get.identifier, Some(staticPartitions))\r\n  initialMatchingPartitions = matchingPartitions.map(_.spec)\r\n  customPartitionLocations = getCustomPartitionLocations(\r\n    fs, catalogTable.get, qualifiedOutputPath, matchingPartitions)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Improve list metastore partitions performance, 200 times better in our production environment\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30504. It proposes:\r\n\r\n- Rename `NoSideEffect` to `NoThrow`, and use `Expression.deterministic` together where it is used.\r\n- Clarify, in the docs in the expressions, that it means they don't throw exceptions\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`NoSideEffect` virtually means that `Expression.eval` does not throw an exception, and the expressions are deterministic.\r\nIt's best to be explicit so `NoThrow` was proposed -  I looked if there's a similar name to represent this concept and borrowed the name of [nothrow](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#nothrow).\r\nFor determinism, we already have a way to note it under `Expression.deterministic`. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually ran the existing unittests written.","created_at":"2020-12-02T11:28:48Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:05:05Z","closed_at":"2020-12-02T16:03:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6b05e0345f6b6523159f914a01e6d1fb5d14dfd5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30570/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30570/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30570/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/36d280577ebcf888ca9ed91ca7f62a45da07db97","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-33544","ref":"SPARK-33544","sha":"36d280577ebcf888ca9ed91ca7f62a45da07db97","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, in spark, the temp view is saved as its analyzed logical plan, while the permanent view\r\nis kept in HMS with its origin SQL text. As a result, permanent and temporary views have\r\ndifferent behaviors in some cases. In this PR we store the SQL text for temporary view in order\r\nto unify the behavior between permanent and temporary views.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nto unify the behavior between permanent and temporary views\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, with this PR, the temporary view will be re-analyzed when it's referred.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAs https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28534 adds functions from [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/timestamp_functions) for converting numbers to timestamp, this PR is to add functions UNIX_SECONDS, UNIX_MILLIS and UNIX_MICROS for converting timestamp to numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. Symmetry of the conversion functions\r\n2. Casting timestamp type to numeric types is disallowed in ANSI mode, we should provide functions for users to complete the conversion.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n3 new functions UNIX_SECONDS, UNIX_MILLIS and UNIX_MICROS for converting timestamp to long type.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPer request from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30395#issuecomment-735028698, here we remove `Windowed` from methods names `setupWindowedJoinWithRangeCondition` and `setupWindowedSelfJoin` as they don't join on time window.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere's no such official name for `windowed join`, so this is to help avoid confusion for future developers.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests.","created_at":"2020-12-02T02:01:55Z","updated_at":"2020-12-02T07:30:06Z","closed_at":"2020-12-02T06:28:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1759a0f435c33e6cfa0c59bf76be5340bf46c34d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe only way to support delete statements right now is to implement ``SupportsDelete``. According to its Javadoc, that interface is meant for cases when we can delete data without much effort (e.g. like deleting a complete partition in a Hive table).\r\n\r\nThis PR actually provides us with a way to check if a data source is going to reject the delete via `deleteWhere` at planning time instead of just getting an exception during execution. In the future, we can use this functionality to decide whether Spark should rewrite this delete and execute a distributed query or it can just pass a set of filters.\r\n\r\nConsider an example of a partitioned Hive table. If we have a delete predicate like `part_col = '2020'`, we can just drop the matching partition to satisfy this delete. In this case, the data source should return `true` from `canDeleteWhere` and use the filters it accepts in `deleteWhere` to drop the partition. I consider this as a delete without significant effort. At the same time, if we have a delete predicate like `id = 10`, Hive tables would not be able to execute this delete using a metadata only operation without rewriting files. In that case, the data source should return `false` from `canDeleteWhere` and we should use a more sophisticated row-level API to find out which records should be removed (the API is yet to be discussed, but we need this PR as a basis).\r\n\r\nIf we decide to support subqueries and all delete use cases by simply extending the existing API, this will mean all data sources will have to implement a lot of Spark logic to determine which records changed. I don't think we want to go that way as the Spark logic to determine which records should be deleted is independent of the underlying data source. So the assumption is that Spark will execute a plan to find which records must be deleted for data sources that return `false` from `canDeleteWhere`.\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes but it is backward compatible. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR comes with a new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCode Gen bug fix that introduced by SPARK-33460\r\n\r\n```\r\nGetMapValueUtil\r\n\r\ns\"\"\"throw new NoSuchElementException(\"Key \" + $eval2 + \" does not exist.\");\"\"\"\r\n\r\nSHOULD BE\r\n\r\ns\"\"\"throw new java.util.NoSuchElementException(\"Key \" + $eval2 + \" does not exist.\");\"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the reason why SPARK-33460 failed to detect this bug via UT,  it was because that `checkExceptionInExpression ` did not work as expect like `checkEvaluation` which will try eval expression with BOTH `CODEGEN_ONLY` and `NO_CODEGEN` mode, and in this PR, will also fix this Test bug, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBug Fix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd UT and Existing

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nRight now, we have a special place in the optimizer where we construct v2 scans. As time shows, we need more rewrite rules that would be executed after the operator optimization and before any stats-related rules for v2 tables. Not all rules will be specific to reads. One option is to rename the current batch into something more generic but it would require changing quite some places. That's why it seems better to introduce a new batch and use it for all rewrites. The name is generic so that we don't limit ourselves to v2 data sources only.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis creates a `hadoop-aws-shaded` jar within `hadoop-cloud` module, which shades Guava and relocate them to the `org.apache.hadoop.shaded` namespace used by the Hadoop side.\r\n\r\nA large portion of the change involves moving `hadoop-aws`, `hadoop-azure` and `hadoop-openstack` under the new `hadoop-2.7` profile. This is to make sure they are not included when the default `hadoop-3.2` profile is active, since otherwise we'd have both `hadoop-aws` and `hadoop-aws-shaded` after build.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nDue to [HADOOP-15387](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-15387), `hadoop-aws` module currently doesn't work with shaded Hadoop clients, namely `hadoop-client-api` and `hadoop-client-runtime`, because the former references some private API from `hadoop-common` which uses Guava and is shaded in `hadoop-client-api`. Consequently, when talking to S3 Spark users may encounter the following error:\r\n```\r\n: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 'void org.apache.hadoop.util.SemaphoredDelegatingExecutor.<init>(com.google.common.util.concurrent.ListeningExecutorService, int, boolean)'\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem.create(S3AFileSystem.java:772)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem.create(FileSystem.java:1118)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem.create(FileSystem.java:1098)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem.create(FileSystem.java:987)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem.create(FileSystem.java:975)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.deploy.SparkHadoopUtil$.createFile(SparkHadoopUtil.scala:510)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR mitigate the issue by shading `hadoop-aws` within Spark itself, and replace the existing `hadoop-aws` jar with `hadoop-aws-shaded` jar. This, however, shall be treated as a temporary fix and should eventually be replaced by the shaded jar from Hadoop side, once [HADOOP-15387](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-15387) is resolved.\r\n\r\n**Also note that, with this PR, `hadoop-aws-shaded` jar becomes a hard dependency, and shall be included even if `hadoop-provided` is specified by Spark users.**\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, the newly introduced `hadoop-aws-shaded` jar becomes a hard dependency, and shall be included even if `hadoop-provided` is specified by Spark users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds logic to handle DELETE/UPDATE/MERGE plans in `PullupCorrelatedPredicates`.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRight now, `PullupCorrelatedPredicates` applies only to filters and unary nodes. As a result, correlated predicates in DELETE/UPDATE/MERGE are not rewritten.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe PR adds 3 new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor CRETE TABLE [AS SELECT] command, creates native Parquet table if neither USING nor STORE AS is specified and `spark.sql.legacy.createHiveTableByDefault` is false.\r\n\r\nThis is a retry after we unify the CREATE TABLE syntax. It partially reverts https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/d2bec5e265e0aa4fa527c3f43cfe738cdbdc4598 \r\n\r\nThis PR allows `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` when `LOCATION` is present. This was not allowed for data source tables before, which is an unnecessary behavior different with hive tables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nChanging from Hive text table to native Parquet table has many benefits:\r\n1. be consistent with `DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable`.\r\n2. better performance\r\n3. better support for nested types (Hive text table doesn't work well with nested types, e.g. `insert into t values struct(null)` actually inserts a null value not `struct(null)` if `t` is a Hive text table, which leads to wrong result)\r\n4. better interoperability as Parquet is a more popular open file format. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo by default. If the config is set, the behavior change is described below:\r\n\r\nBehavior-wise, the change is very small as the native Parquet table is also Hive-compatible. All the Spark DDL commands that works for hive tables also works for native Parquet tables, with two exceptions: `ALTER TABLE SET [SERDE | SERDEPROPERTIES]` and `LOAD DATA`.\r\n\r\nchar/varchar behavior has been taken care by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30412, and there is no behavior difference between data source and hive tables.\r\n\r\nOne potential issue is `CREATE TABLE ... LOCATION ...` while users want to directly access the files later. It's more like a corner case and the legacy config should be good enough.\r\n\r\nAnother potential issue is users may use Spark to create the table and then use Hive to add partitions with different serde. This is not allowed for Spark native tables.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRe-enable the

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen running Spark behind a reverse proxy(e.g. Nginx, Apache HTTP server), the request URL can be encoded twice if we pass the query string directly to the constructor of `java.net.URI`:\r\n```\r\n> val uri = \"http://localhost:8081/test\"\r\n> val query = \"order%5B0%5D%5Bcolumn%5D=0\"  // query string of URL from the reverse proxy\r\n> val rewrittenURI = URI.create(uri.toString())\r\n\r\n> new URI(rewrittenURI.getScheme(),\r\n      rewrittenURI.getAuthority(), \r\n      rewrittenURI.getPath(),\r\n      query, \r\n      rewrittenURI.getFragment()).toString\r\nresult: http://localhost:8081/test?order%255B0%255D%255Bcolumn%255D=0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Spark's stage page, the URL of \"/taskTable\" contains query parameter order[0][dir]. After encoding twice, the query parameter becomes `order%255B0%255D%255Bdir%255D` and it will be decoded as `order%5B0%5D%5Bdir%5D` instead of `order[0][dir]`. As a result, there will be NullPointerException from https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/status/api/v1/StagesResource.scala#L176\r\nOther than that, the other parameter may not work as expected after encoded twice.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix the bug by calling the method `URI.create(String URL)` directly. This convenience method can avoid encoding twice on the query parameter.\r\n```\r\n> val uri = \"http://localhost:8081/test\"\r\n> val query = \"order%5B0%5D%5Bcolumn%5D=0\"\r\n> URI.create(s\"$uri?$query\").toString\r\nresult: http://localhost:8081/test?order%5B0%5D%5Bcolumn%5D=0\r\n\r\n> URI.create(s\"$uri?$query\").getQuery\r\nresult: order[0][column]=0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix a potential bug when Spark's reverse proxy is enabled.\r\nThe bug itself is similar to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29271.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new unit test.\r\nAlso, Manual UI testing for master, worker and app UI with an nginx proxy\r\n\r\nSpark

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPerform partition spec normalization in `ShowTablesCommand` according to the table schema before getting partitions from the catalog. The normalization via `PartitioningUtils.normalizePartitionSpec()` adjusts the column names in partition specification, w.r.t. the real partition column names and case sensitivity.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEven when `spark.sql.caseSensitive` is `false` which is the default value, v1 `SHOW TABLE EXTENDED` is case sensitive:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE tbl1 (price int, qty int, year int, month int)\r\n         > USING parquet\r\n         > partitioned by (year, month);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO tbl1 PARTITION(year = 2015, month = 1) SELECT 1, 1;\r\nspark-sql> SHOW TABLE EXTENDED LIKE 'tbl1' PARTITION(YEAR = 2015, Month = 1);\r\nError in query: Partition spec is invalid. The spec (YEAR, Month) must match the partition spec (year, month) defined in table '`default`.`tbl1`';\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the `SHOW TABLE EXTENDED` command respects the SQL config. And for example above, it returns correct result:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SHOW TABLE EXTENDED LIKE 'tbl1' PARTITION(YEAR = 2015, Month = 1);\r\ndefault\ttbl1\tfalse\tPartition Values: [year=2015, month=1]\r\nLocation: file:/Users/maximgekk/spark-warehouse/tbl1/year=2015/month=1\r\nSerde Library: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.serde.ParquetHiveSerDe\r\nInputFormat:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPerform partition spec normalization in `ShowTablesCommand` according to the table schema before getting partitions from the catalog. The normalization via `PartitioningUtils.normalizePartitionSpec()` adjusts the column names in partition specification, w.r.t. the real partition column names and case sensitivity.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEven when `spark.sql.caseSensitive` is `false` which is the default value, v1 `SHOW TABLE EXTENDED` is case sensitive:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE tbl1 (price int, qty int, year int, month int)\r\n         > USING parquet\r\n         > partitioned by (year, month);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO tbl1 PARTITION(year = 2015, month = 1) SELECT 1, 1;\r\nspark-sql> SHOW TABLE EXTENDED LIKE 'tbl1' PARTITION(YEAR = 2015, Month = 1);\r\nError in query: Partition spec is invalid. The spec (YEAR, Month) must match the partition spec (year, month) defined in table '`default`.`tbl1`';\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the `SHOW TABLE EXTENDED` command respects the SQL config. And for example above, it returns correct result:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SHOW TABLE EXTENDED LIKE 'tbl1' PARTITION(YEAR = 2015, Month = 1);\r\ndefault\ttbl1\tfalse\tPartition Values: [year=2015, month=1]\r\nLocation: file:/Users/maximgekk/spark-warehouse/tbl1/year=2015/month=1\r\nSerde Library: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.serde.ParquetHiveSerDe\r\nInputFormat:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs described in SPARK-33557, `HeartbeatReceiver` and `MesosCoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` will always use

is different from the relationship described in `configuration.md`.\r\n\r\nTo fix this problem，the main change of this pr as follow:\r\n\r\n- Remove the explicitly default value of `STORAGE_BLOCKMANAGER_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT`\r\n\r\n- Use actual value of `NETWORK_TIMEOUT` as `STORAGE_BLOCKMANAGER_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT` when `STORAGE_BLOCKMANAGER_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT` not configured in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that the histogram and timeline aren't rendered in the `Streaming Query Statistics` page if we built Spark with Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n![before-fix-the-issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/100612855-f543d700-3356-11eb-90d9-ede57b8b3f4f.png)\r\n![NaN_Error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/100612879-00970280-3357-11eb-97cf-43978bbe2d3a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason is [`maxRecordRate` can be `NaN`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/streaming/ui/StreamingQueryStatisticsPage.scala#L371) for Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\nThe `NaN` is the result of [`query.recentProgress.map(_.inputRowsPerSecond).max`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/streaming/ui/StreamingQueryStatisticsPage.scala#L372) when the first element of `query.recentProgress.map(_.inputRowsPerSecond)` is `NaN`.\r\nActually, the comparison logic for `Double` type was changed in Scala 2.13.\r\nhttps://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12107\r\nhttps://github.com/scala/scala/pull/6410\r\n\r\nSo this issue happens as of Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the `NaN` is [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/ProgressReporter.scala#L164).\r\nThis `NaN` seems to be an initial value of `inputTimeSec` so I think `Double.PositiveInfinity` is suitable rather than `NaN` and this change can resolve this issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make sure we can use the histogram/timeline with Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nFirst, I built with the following commands.\r\n```\r\n$ /dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver -Pscala-2.13 package\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, ran the following query (this is brought from #30427 ).\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.Trigger\r\nval query = spark\r\n  .readStream\r\n
