Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11488](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11488) Removes support for deprecated Sensitive Properties Algorithms and retains support for the following standard and optional values:\r\n\r\n- NIFI_PBKDF2_AES_GCM_256\r\n- NIFI_ARGON2_AES_GCM_256\r\n\r\nChanges include adjusting secret key derivation to use components from `nifi-security-crypto-key` instead of `nifi-security-utils`, maintaining compatibility while reducing required dependencies in the `nifi-property-encryptor` module.\r\n\r\nMost of the changed files reflect removal or adjustment of test application properties. Many tests do not need `nifi.sensitive.props.algorithm`, so removing the property reduces the amount of future maintenance required.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking

Doesn't impact the flow otherwise. ENFORCE - Apart from the warnings, also invalidates components that violate the rule.\r\n\r\nFlow analysis is run by the framework:\r\n-For the whole flow (starting at the root process group), scheduled every 5 minutes (similar to validation) -For each component individually, during their validation -For a process group (can be root), when requested asynchronously through REST interface (not from UI as of yet)\r\n\r\nFlow analysis may produce rule violations as a result. These are stored in memory and are not persisted. They\r\n-Can be requested through REST interface (not from UI as of yet) -In case of rules with ENFORCE enforcement policy, invalidate the corresponding components\r\n\r\nCurrently, FlowAnalysisRule implementations are directly provided either -a component (currently supported Processors and ControllerServices) as VersionedComponent instances. Concrete type should be determined by the rule. -a process group as a VersionedProcessGroup.\r\nIndirectly they can analyze other components accessible from the directly provided components.\r\n\r\nAdded one FlowAnalyisRule implementation: DisallowComponentType. It can be configured with the (simple or fully qualified) name of a type. Produces a rule violation for each supported component (currently controller service and processor) instances of that type.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior

an extra check during directory creation to see if directory wasn't already created in another thread.\r\n\r\nFrom Issue:\r\n\r\nProblem happens when a PutFTP is set to run several concurrent tasks and two (or more ) FlowFiles come in and both need to create the same directory. One of them will create directory and succeed immediately while the other will try to create directory, but fail since it already exist, throw an error, the FlowFile will then be penalized and on second run will succeed.\r\n\r\nWhile it is not the biggest error, as files are getting transferred in the end, but the bulletins and errors are annoying, especially in production environment where you don't want to get unnecessary errors.\r\n\r\nWe found that the solution involves a simple change to the FTPTransfer.java class in:\r\nnifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/standard/util/FTPTransfer.java\r\nOn line 398 and ensureDirectoryExists method you can simply add another if check which double checks that the directory exists when it fails to create one.\r\n```java\r\nfinal boolean cdSuccessful = setWorkingDirectory(remoteDirectory);\r\n\r\nif (!cdSuccessful) {    \r\n  if (client.makeDirectory(remoteDirectory)) {        \r\n    logger.debug(\"Remote Directory not found: created directory [{}]\", remoteDirectory);    \r\n  } else if (!setWorkingDirectory(remoteDirectory)) { \r\n         // Double check that the dir exists as it might have been created in another thread        \r\n    throw new IOException(\"Failed to create remote directory \" + remoteDirectory);    \r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more -->\r\n<!-- contributor license agreements.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11461](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11461) Improves the performance of the User and Group Tenants Search REST Resource method with the addition of a `searchTenants` method to the `NiFiServiceFacade`.\r\n\r\nThe previous implementation called `getUsers()` and `getUserGroups()` in the Tenants Resource, which requires retrieving all users and all group members before evaluating the query.\r\n\r\nThe new implementation passes the query string to the `NiFiServiceFacade.searchTenants()` method and applies the filtering criteria prior to additional object creation. This approach reduces the number of method calls significantly for large numbers of users and groups.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include adjusting the user interface autocomplete delay from the default 300 ms to 500 ms, minimizing the number of HTTP requests in some scenarios.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11466](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11466) This PR adds a ModifyCompression processor which combines the functionality of CompressContent with the ability to decompress the input then recompress the output, avoiding any disk usage between multiple CompressContent processors (decompress -> recompress) and uses sensible in-memory buffers to avoid out-of-memory errors.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11437](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11437) Improves content type detection in `EncryptContentPGP` using a [PushbackInputStream](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/PushbackInputStream.html) to read up to 8 KB for initial evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe new approach removes the separate call to `ProcessSession.read()` and instead uses a single initial buffer for content type detection.\r\n\r\nThe runtime behavior change is observable in Processor statistics. For a 10 byte file created using `GenerateFlowFile`, the current version of `EncryptContentPGP` would show 20 bytes read. With these changes, `EncryptContentPGP` reports 10 bytes read because the buffered approach avoids multiple reads.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11425](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11425) Removes the `Compression Algorithm` property from `EncryptContentPGP` and `SignContentPGP` Processors. Changes also include removal of the [Camellia cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_%28cipher%29) values from the `Symmetric-Key Algorithm` property in `EncryptContentPGP`.\r\n\r\nThese changes align with current recommendations in the [draft refreshed specification for OpenPGP](https://wiki.gnupg.org/rfc4880bis). Compression adds little value and introduces the potential for some vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThe `DecryptContentPGP` and `VerifyContentPGP` Processors retain the ability to read compressed messages.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\nMost of the NiFi processors use external libraries which may register JMX Beans like Kafka processors. Exposing such metrics can help with problem solving.\r\n\r\nThe information available depends on the registered Beans and usually related to performance indicators such as request/response rate, latency, request size, request counts or tool specific ones like commit rate or sync/join time for Kafka.\r\n\r\nGoals\r\nHave an REST endpoint with a list of JMX Bean attributes.\r\nExpose data in a secure way.\r\nHave some kind of filtering.\r\n\r\nNon-Goals\r\nListing or executing supported operations of JMX Beans.\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11385](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11385)\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11370](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11370) Corrects JSON Web Key Set retrieval when using the `NIFI` Trust Store Strategy.\r\n\r\nThe `NIFI` trust store strategy can be configured using `nifi.security.user.oidc.truststore.strategy` in application properties for integrating with Identity Providers that do not use certificates issued from public authorities.\r\n\r\nThe standard Spring Security [OidcIdTokenDecoderFactory](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/main/oauth2/oauth2-client/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/oauth2/client/oidc/authentication/OidcIdTokenDecoderFactory.java) implementation does not support providing an instance of `RestOperations` to the `NimbusJwtDecoder` builder, which results in using the default Java trust store instead of the NiFi trust store strategy.\r\n\r\nThe new `StandardOidcIdTokenDecoderFactory` supports a configurable instance of `RestOperations`, which is configured in the `OidcSecurityConfiguration`. The new Decoder Factory supports the same capabilities as the default Spring Security implementation in terms of JWS algorithms allowed.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking

and controller services in enabled state will fail silently on nifi startup if a resource they rely on is missing.\r\n\r\nThis adds logging/bulletins to alert users to this situation after two minutes as well as after each hour nifi is still trying to start these components.\r\n\r\n**To test processor:**  \r\nSet up GenerateFlowFile -> IdentifyMimeType flow\r\nwhere IdentifyMimeTypes's Config File property is set to\r\n[config file](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/rel/nifi-1.20.0/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/test/resources/TestIdentifyMimeType/.customConfig.xml)\r\nStart IdentifyMimeType\r\nstop nifi\r\nmove/rename config file\r\nstart nifi\r\n\r\nIdentifyMimeType will not start.\r\nBefore this fix there is no error.\r\nThere will now be an error (and bulletin) after two minutes as well as each hour.\r\nRestoring the config file to its original location will allow the processor to reach Start state and stop these errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n **To test controller service:**  \r\nEnable StandardSSLContextService controller service\r\nstop nifi\r\nmove/rename keystore (and/or truststore) that controller service is pointing to \r\nstart nifi\r\n\r\nStandardSSLContextService will not start.\r\nBefore this fix there is no error.\r\nThere will now be an error (and bulletin) after two minutes as well as each hour.\r\nRestoring the keystore/truststore file to its original location will allow the controller service to reach Enabled state and will stop these errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request
