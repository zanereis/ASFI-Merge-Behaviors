PR adds new Plugin API - listeners. It enables plugin authors to write [`pluggy` hook implementation](https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) that will be called on certain formalized extension points. To differentiate between current Airflow extension points, like plugins, and current Airflow hooks, implementations of those hooks are called `listeners`.\r\n\r\nThe API is ment to be called across all dags, and all operators - in contrast to current `on_success_callback`, `pre_execute` and related family which are meant to provide callbacks for particular dag authors, or operator creators. \r\n\r\n`pluggy` mechanism enables us to execute multiple, or none, listeners that implement particular extension point, so that users can use multiple listeners seamlessly.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, three such extension points are added. \r\nWhen TaskInstance's state is changed to `RUNNING`, `on_task_instance_running` hook is called. On change to`SUCCESS` `on_task_instance_success` is called, similarly on `FAILED` `on_task_instance_failed` is called.\r\n\r\nActual notification mechanism is be implemented using [SQLAlchemy’s events mechanism](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/session_events.html#after-flush). This ensures that plugins will get every change of state, regardless of where in the codebase it happened, and not require manual annotation of TI state changes across the codebase.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that this change is not affecting performance, running this mechanism on scheduler is disabled by default. The SQLAlchemy event mechanism is also not affected by default - the event listener is only added if we have any plugin which actually provides any listener. \r\n\r\n\r\nDesign doc:\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1L3xfdlWVUrdnFXng1Di4nMQYQtzMfhvvWDR9K4wXnDU/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nBackground to this change: \r\nWhen discussing changing LineageBackend api for OpenLineage plugin, we came to consensus that the changes proposed there would be better suited to the new API https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/17984 \r\n\r\nrelated:

filename renderer.\r\n\r\nSince the previous change has not been released, I opted to update the migration in-place instead of creating a new one.\r\n\r\nAlso added some more tests on `task_log_prefix_template`.","created_at":"2021-12-20T21:28:18Z","updated_at":"2022-04-14T12:49:33Z","closed_at":"2021-12-21T12:26:58Z","merged_at":"2021-12-21T12:26:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"302efad167a54f05642ff163c1319b40d2196970","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

#19891\r\n\r\nIn a previous PR to fix Mypy errors, the `region` arg was removed from `default_args` in the Alibaba example DAGs. While this did alleviate Mypy errors it removed a valid DAG-authoring feature that was being showcased.  This PR returns the `region` arg to `default_args` as well as handling Mypy errors.\r\n\r\n> Note: Generally it seems like the first approach to handle these call-arg errors from Mypy related to `default_args` functionality is to add the ignore comments where appropriate. A proper fix for these scenarios seems very non-trivial and this is a good interim solution.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

airflow community! \r\nI have seen that lately the topic \"manual notes\" has been mentioned by various users (#19011, #20122 etc), and they were all referred back to my original issue #16790 (and PRs #16953 and #17181). \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the work in those PRs is far from being great and the lack of time (and feedback from the community) drove me away from that work. (Moreover the code was deleted from my fork and it was hard to reach)\r\n\r\nI am just sharing again my original idea here with this stripped down version of the previous implementations, hopefully this sparkles a discussion and/or a real implementation among the interested people (such as @euccas and @Acehaidrey)\r\n\r\nMy very original idea in #19011 was to introduce a concept of \"task note\" for a task instance loosely based on the concept of Xcom (in retrospective it did not make much sense 😄 ). \r\n\r\nIn #17181, I tried to generalize the idea by having a generic \"even note\" that works something like this: \r\n- I tried to select some events (user actions) which could be interesting to be noted (mostly any \"confirm operation\" and trigger) and there I added a field in the post request with the \"note\" name. \r\n- The model of an Event note is composed by `dag_id`, `task_id`, `execution_date` `owner` `timestamp` which means that an event should be related to a specific task_id of a specific dag of a specific execution_date (Which is kind of a limitation). (Actually in #17181 i also support trigger_run event note which are not related to a task id leaving the field empty)\r\n- Instead of changing of the relative APIs to handle the extra field, I created a decorated (loosely inspired by the action_logging operator) that if the request contains the `note` field it creates an entry in the even_notes table using as event name the name of the API (again inspired by the action_logging). \r\nThis is also great, imho, because you can extend any API adding the support for note taking without changing it (and if you want to improve/change the note part, you also need to modify it in one place) \r\n\r\n\r\nThis being the simplest POC possible does have unanswered questions such as:\r\n- What does \"event\" mean? Which kind of activities/event should be notables? EG: Pausing a dag should be notable?\r\n- Should an event always be linked to a dag or/and task id (It is in this current implementation), if yes, how do you handle the \"mark recursively success/failures\" ?\r\n- How do users access notes? Here we are using the browser view but in #17181 there was an idea of having a dag view notes and a task instance note view as well.\r\n- Probably many others 😄 \r\n\r\nMy feeling is that there should probably be an higher level of abstraction for handling this feature properly and this is mostly a borderline wrong implementation, but without the vision of the core contributors it's complicated to implement a feature that spans different domains (frontend/backend/database/user expectations)\r\n\r\n\r\nI really hope this sparkles a discussion in the community on how to develop this feature in

if a DAG with large tasks reaches a concurrency limit, task instances\r\nin other dags will get stuck in scheduled state. The reason is that at each\r\nscheduler loop, task instances of this large DAG are picked up for examination\r\ndespite that the DAG has reached the concurrency limit.\r\nThis makes it almost impossible to run other task instances in other DAGs unless the\r\nlarge DAG is stopped.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I added a column on the task instance table to know when the scheduler\r\nexamined the task instance. Once a dag has reached any of the concurrency limits, the value\r\nof this column is updated and when any task instance has finished running,\r\nthe column is nullified so that the scheduler will

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/20283\r\n\r\nIn this PR:\r\n- [x]  Upgrade the minimum package requirement to 2.33.0 for apache-beam (first stable for beam go sdk)\r\n- [x]  Refactor `operators/beam.py` with an abstract `BeamBasePipelineOperator` class to factorize initialization and common code, also fixed mypy hook on ``BeamDataflowMixin``\r\n- [x] Add `BeamRunGoPipelineOperator` and `BeamHook.start_go_pipeline` (+tests)\r\n- [x]  Add `utils/go_module.py` to handle initialisation and dependency installation for a module. (+ tests)\r\n- [x]  Slightly modified `process_util` + tests to be able to handle an extra optional parameter `cwd`. (This way we can move to the module directory to build it)\r\n- [x]  Write docs\r\n- [x]  Add dags examples, with system tests\r\n- [ ]  I think we might want to install Go in the docker images.

#20333\r\n\r\nCurrently there is a datatype check on `source_objects` within the `GCSToBigQueryOperator.__init__()` method. This is a template field for the operator. If a user tries to pass in an `XCom` value that will be rendered as a list (i.e. `render_template_as_native_obj=True` at the DAG level), the datatype check incorrectly assumes the value is a string and wraps the value in a list. When the `XCom` value is then rendered during `execute()` the value becomes a `List[List]` instead of the desired `List` type. \r\n\r\nMoving this datatype check into the `execute()` method of the operator will allow any template rendering to occur before the check is performed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

were short-circuting permission in the views instead of letting the security manager handle that. A user will find it inconsistent as the Graph and other views check \"per-dag\" permissions via https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/174681911f96f17d41a4f560ca08d5e200944f7f/airflow/www/views.py#L579\r\n\r\nso if someone uses Custom Security Manager that will end up with user not being able to \"pause\" DAG from individual dag page but would be able to do so from Homepage.

introduced a flag in #20217 to help us not accidentally use deprecated context variables. This works locally, but I failed to notice it does not work in CI because our scripts explicitly pass `--pythonwarnings=ignore::DeprecationWarning`, which overrides my added config. Consequently, quite several deprecated usages leaked into `main`.\r\n\r\nThis PR properly fixes all those deprecated usages. Also, since no explainations were offered at the time the flag was added (it’s been there ever since Pytest was adopted as the test runner), I removed that ignore flag entirely. This should help us identify more deprecated usages (there are quite several) and fix them eventually to work toward #19788.","created_at":"2021-12-15T17:33:08Z","updated_at":"2022-01-25T23:36:11Z","closed_at":"2021-12-21T10:00:47Z","merged_at":"2021-12-21T10:00:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"9876e19273cd56dc53d3a4e287db43acbfa65c4b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769003317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5MDAzMzE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:dev-tools","name":"area:dev-tools","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

a nasty bug where somebody basically implemented their own KubernetesPodSensor, which failed after more than one attempt when using mode=\"poke\" + a volume + a secret.\r\n\r\nRoot cause turned out to be in `secret.attach_to_pod()`. In here, a volume and volumemount is created to mount the secret. A deepcopy() is made of the given Pod spec. In order to avoid appending to None, there is this line: `cp_pod.spec.volumes = pod.spec.volumes or []`. In case a volume is set on the Pod spec, a reference is created to the original pod spec volumes, which in turn was a reference to `self.volumes`. As a result, each secret resulted in a volume added to `self.volumes`, which resulted in an error when running the sensor a second time because the secret volume was already mounted during the first sensor attempt.\r\n\r\nThis PR references the deepcopied object instead, and creates a new list if pod.spec.volumes is None.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
