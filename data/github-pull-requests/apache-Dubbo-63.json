contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-05T05:27:24Z","updated_at":"2019-03-25T02:38:31Z","closed_at":"2019-03-07T08:26:17Z","merged_at":"2019-03-07T08:26:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"fe049b8ddd29cd4539d9603bdc680f1e43a7d784","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3597/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3597/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3597/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/476d3bb6af08e5f01eb678a74dd84650265eb887","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:restProtocolTest","ref":"restProtocolTest","sha":"476d3bb6af08e5f01eb678a74dd84650265eb887","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-04T07:28:30Z","updated_at":"2019-04-29T05:18:04Z","closed_at":"2019-03-11T02:31:22Z","merged_at":"2019-03-11T02:31:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"096d1dae2adc86be71076a53c1ded690cc5b4997","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3593/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3593/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3593/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ae8429843845aaa9ce22bb11fd6e968fe4dc6c7b","head":{"label":"beiwei30:consul-support","ref":"consul-support","sha":"ae8429843845aaa9ce22bb11fd6e968fe4dc6c7b","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e8d645b254c5fe8d786000473d62a5dcc2bebddc","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-01T03:17:24Z","updated_at":"2019-03-25T02:37:34Z","closed_at":"2019-03-07T08:02:09Z","merged_at":"2019-03-07T08:02:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"ef2cae1fc01a46caaf7a56897d443c95f448a91e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3581/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3581/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3581/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/fbea7480f975c1fffffbc1a2e6a2fe04e513b4a6","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:basicClientConnManager","ref":"basicClientConnManager","sha":"fbea7480f975c1fffffbc1a2e6a2fe04e513b4a6","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-25T11:13:00Z","updated_at":"2019-02-26T02:24:14Z","closed_at":"2019-02-26T02:24:11Z","merged_at":"2019-02-26T02:24:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"e76a37720978981f40e07b40d9156562fa7d0df6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3563/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3563/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3563/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5456bbd2cdb960024b3dbb97a132bb55d1952185","head":{"label":"Jeff-Lv:3.x-dev","ref":"3.x-dev","sha":"5456bbd2cdb960024b3dbb97a132bb55d1952185","user":{"login":"Jeff-Lv","id":6000915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDA5MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6000915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv","html_url":"https://github.com/Jeff-Lv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":148290046,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDgyOTAwNDY=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"Jeff-Lv/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Jeff-Lv","id":6000915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDA5MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6000915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv","html_url":"https://github.com/Jeff-Lv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeff-Lv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Jeff-Lv/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nUT\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-25T08:35:19Z","updated_at":"2019-02-25T09:13:02Z","closed_at":"2019-02-25T09:13:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8bc7744a91edc2dc9daff0392604ea587263caa3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3559/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3559/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3559/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/658911228aa4948973d1debf36216f14ae8293ae","head":{"label":"LiZhenNet:fix/3420","ref":"fix/3420","sha":"658911228aa4948973d1debf36216f14ae8293ae","user":{"login":"LiZhenNet","id":9859779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NTk3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9859779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet","html_url":"https://github.com/LiZhenNet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":158160981,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTgxNjA5ODE=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"LiZhenNet/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LiZhenNet","id":9859779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NTk3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9859779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet","html_url":"https://github.com/LiZhenNet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LiZhenNet/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-25T08:11:44Z","updated_at":"2021-06-04T08:38:24Z","closed_at":"2019-03-08T06:50:46Z","merged_at":"2019-03-08T06:50:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"42646d7f36dd0394a10b77e0175be430067f943f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3558/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3558/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3558/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/524f893933dce1d5f495791b73067e2c42b1d983","head":{"label":"kexianjun:fix-3555","ref":"fix-3555","sha":"524f893933dce1d5f495791b73067e2c42b1d983","user":{"login":"kexianjun","id":12162539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12162539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun","html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":145399297,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDUzOTkyOTc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kexianjun/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kexianjun","id":12162539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12162539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun","html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun/dubbo","description":"Apache

#3556 \r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-25T07:24:52Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T04:05:39Z","closed_at":"2019-02-26T03:48:02Z","merged_at":"2019-02-26T03:48:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"5434ab74c724e4ed0f4b7dab11e6758a0a9c48d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3557/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3557/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3557/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5b39e5c1d02e011fdfdb9501472f4576d3aa2b5e","head":{"label":"ujjboy:fix_npe","ref":"fix_npe","sha":"5b39e5c1d02e011fdfdb9501472f4576d3aa2b5e","user":{"login":"ujjboy","id":1424920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjQ5MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1424920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy","html_url":"https://github.com/ujjboy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":172448593,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0NDg1OTM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"ujjboy/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ujjboy","id":1424920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjQ5MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1424920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy","html_url":"https://github.com/ujjboy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ujjboy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ujjboy/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nsee UT\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn

What is the purpose of the change\r\nfix npe\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-22T09:51:21Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T11:27:16Z","closed_at":"2019-02-24T06:20:57Z","merged_at":"2019-02-24T06:20:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"e89b3f2728248242e38e70627d761be776ef03ec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3548/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3548/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3548/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0bab36874048ed17e1991b73ad3238381a3a4214","head":{"label":"hekrxe:master","ref":"master","sha":"0bab36874048ed17e1991b73ad3238381a3a4214","user":{"login":"hekrxe","id":31140096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTQwMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31140096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekrxe","html_url":"https://github.com/hekrxe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekrxe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekrxe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekrxe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekrxe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekrxe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekrxe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekrxe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekrxe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekrxe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f71a95bc66ce35aaedb4f3403363327230582481","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptio

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-22T09:33:14Z","updated_at":"2021-04-27T05:55:21Z","closed_at":"2019-03-01T17:27:16Z","merged_at":"2019-03-01T17:27:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"8c934c9c8bb979a731f02638bdb7c1641d70bf73","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3547/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3547/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3547/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1e93dd7d23beafe27515f6f1960e7d99ced978b4","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:cleanDubboCodec","ref":"cleanDubboCodec","sha":"1e93dd7d23beafe27515f6f1960e7d99ced978b4","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-21T14:50:19Z","updated_at":"2019-02-22T02:07:31Z","closed_at":"2019-02-22T02:07:31Z","merged_at":"2019-02-22T02:07:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"4a28ea13790849db49dd40be5665f46ea905af81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3538/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3538/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3538/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/795822d2ad4387dea0fcfb970dab11a0c221daec","head":{"label":"nzomkxia:2.6.x","ref":"2.6.x","sha":"795822d2ad4387dea0fcfb970dab11a0c221daec","user":{"login":"nzomkxia","id":1183397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1183397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia","html_url":"https://github.com/nzomkxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:2.6.x","ref":"2.6.x","sha":"badea862d341f0468c1dea45dbeeed7e06b7c0da","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-20T09:22:43Z","updated_at":"2019-08-03T02:00:02Z","closed_at":"2019-08-03T02:00:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bc36b294110a8ac9ae7e9e10fdedb481f17acd6f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741981,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDE5ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/don%E2%80%99t-merge","name":"status/don’t-merge","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":"No

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix Endpoint address is missing in WSDL with webserivce protocol #1655 #3411\r\n\r\nI recently researched the source code of the relevant cxf and found that two changes in the cxf 2.7.x and 3.2.x versions affected this bug.\r\n1.HTTPTransportFactory no longer implements the WSDLEndpointFactory interface\r\n2.the disableAddressUpdates parameter in the ServletController default to true, and the default is false before.\r\n\r\nFor the first problem, I solved it in the code.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n文档不正确，运行时会缺少依赖\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n增加dubbo的pom文件。zookeeper/curator-framework的依赖。因为dubbo-dependencies-bom当中声明curator-framework时去除了zookeeper的版本，所以外部还需要额外机上zookeeper的依赖包。\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-20T06:45:23Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T07:42:17Z","closed_at":"2019-03-07T07:42:16Z","merged_at":"2019-03-07T07:42:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"1420698acd59c4af5d746a58a2a46fadcf292b8c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3516/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3516/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3516/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/862c5e24df6e9a1751f4a8a0386fdf15d60e086a","head":{"label":"awayings:master","ref":"master","sha":"862c5e24df6e9a1751f4a8a0386fdf15d60e086a","user":{"login":"awayings","id":688149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODE0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/688149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings","html_url":"https://github.com/awayings","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":171612303,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2MTIzMDM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"awayings/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"awayings","id":688149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODE0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/688149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings","html_url":"https://github.com/awayings","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awayings/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/awayings/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-20T02:55:30Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T07:32:28Z","closed_at":"2019-02-20T07:32:28Z","merged_at":"2019-02-20T07:32:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"0f9cef935de04a437d7ffe910c55c600591611cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3511/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3511/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3511/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/97ae28cd93e2f14e1142a15913e8db230202d831","head":{"label":"nzomkxia:2.6.x","ref":"2.6.x","sha":"97ae28cd93e2f14e1142a15913e8db230202d831","user":{"login":"nzomkxia","id":1183397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1183397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia","html_url":"https://github.com/nzomkxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:2.6.x","ref":"2.6.x","sha":"54e14e905c0d0e3b2921e6897ccb79afc0050fc5","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-19T08:58:49Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T11:39:16Z","closed_at":"2019-02-19T15:09:55Z","merged_at":"2019-02-19T15:09:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"7c236ca8f74e6797dac4d432a37294ee8a4529d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3505/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3505/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3505/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8494fdc136d393016fe0cff81a5d1ed5b379a11e","head":{"label":"beiwei30:issue1293","ref":"issue1293","sha":"8494fdc136d393016fe0cff81a5d1ed5b379a11e","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"9031a4c20455ba16a63233f10783a55915afcd9b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/star

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-18T07:19:11Z","updated_at":"2019-02-19T10:17:33Z","closed_at":"2019-02-19T10:17:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a7c01bba1b13df326484bb486536049634d7f3f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3498/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3498/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3498/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6eeb1a894130917fa83303586ddb5e62fa5d5818","head":{"label":"beiwei30:issue1875","ref":"issue1875","sha":"6eeb1a894130917fa83303586ddb5e62fa5d5818","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"9031a4c20455ba16a63233f10783a55915afcd9b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-17T15:43:41Z","updated_at":"2019-02-17T15:47:58Z","closed_at":"2019-02-17T15:47:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3492/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3492/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3492/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9362181d1285fe89d345ebf92ec4186353f1fd02","head":{"label":"apache:2.5.x","ref":"2.5.x","sha":"9362181d1285fe89d345ebf92ec4186353f1fd02","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-14T07:47:27Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T11:44:45Z","closed_at":"2019-02-15T09:12:50Z","merged_at":"2019-02-15T09:12:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"d33784d3c887aefd647e24a9e46f58be8ad4f02a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3471/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3471/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3471/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5a5e116a3da6dd3d7980d1e0dadadddc914bd9a8","head":{"label":"wanghbxxxx:branch_refactorVersion","ref":"branch_refactorVersion","sha":"5a5e116a3da6dd3d7980d1e0dadadddc914bd9a8","user":{"login":"wanghbxxxx","id":6959062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTkwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6959062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx","html_url":"https://github.com/wanghbxxxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":168285473,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjgyODU0NzM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"wanghbxxxx/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wanghbxxxx","id":6959062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTkwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6959062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx","html_url":"https://github.com/wanghbxxxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wanghbxxxx/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nApache parent pom version is updated to most recent one.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-14T07:33:06Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T11:49:41Z","closed_at":"2019-02-14T10:22:39Z","merged_at":"2019-02-14T10:22:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"6058846d64d8e95c933baf426d624f2093ef97f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3470/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3470/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3470/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f531b8900741dea680e682afdd36690770ab47a0","head":{"label":"kamaci:feature/apache_pom","ref":"feature/apache_pom","sha":"f531b8900741dea680e682afdd36690770ab47a0","user":{"login":"kamaci","id":3921885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjE4ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3921885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci","html_url":"https://github.com/kamaci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamaci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"6f28ff45833cfc51d1e2ee2ccfa723613128125d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-13T02:24:08Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T05:41:30Z","closed_at":"2019-12-11T05:41:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e63f73b3a7348a36968c075e7397314ae4300e0d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/6/labels","id":2784634,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMjc4NDYzNA==","number":6,"title":"some

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nci pass\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-12T07:10:09Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T11:53:19Z","closed_at":"2019-02-12T07:52:39Z","merged_at":"2019-02-12T07:52:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"36c75d7ce4895ec0aa856ae6ddaeda7de9b3a402","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3453/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3453/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3453/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8357d361a0cf487fb1edd0d88fe2d7ccc47d7e82","head":{"label":"wanghbxxxx:branch_refactorExtensionLoaderInjectExtension","ref":"branch_refactorExtensionLoaderInjectExtension","sha":"8357d361a0cf487fb1edd0d88fe2d7ccc47d7e82","user":{"login":"wanghbxxxx","id":6959062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTkwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6959062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx","html_url":"https://github.com/wanghbxxxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":168285473,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjgyODU0NzM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"wanghbxxxx/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wanghbxxxx","id":6959062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTkwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6959062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx","html_url":"https://github.com/wanghbxxxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wanghbxxxx/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-11T09:13:42Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T11:52:58Z","closed_at":"2019-02-12T08:16:16Z","merged_at":"2019-02-12T08:16:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"fa2316eb29843439ae9097df2bd4f865ac88d538","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3447/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3447/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3447/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1590377a4542cbe0d40d4fa1b5d594467b5c9773","head":{"label":"LiZhenNet:refactor/service","ref":"refactor/service","sha":"1590377a4542cbe0d40d4fa1b5d594467b5c9773","user":{"login":"LiZhenNet","id":9859779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NTk3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9859779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet","html_url":"https://github.com/LiZhenNet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":158160981,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTgxNjA5ODE=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"LiZhenNet/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LiZhenNet","id":9859779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NTk3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9859779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet","html_url":"https://github.com/LiZhenNet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LiZhenNet/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove unused duplicated method\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nRemove unused method `org.apache.dubbo.registry.zookeeper.ZookeeperRegistry#appendDefaultPort` and move the unit tests to `org.apache.dubbo.common.URLTest`, which has the same method and is used and missing a unit test\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nCI pass\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2019-02-10T09:53:04Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T11:58:07Z","closed_at":"2019-02-11T02:07:12Z","merged_at":"2019-02-11T02:07:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"ba282a867f25be6255320088e1519a572e01e04c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3446/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3446/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3446/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e7c6fc97b9428264e7fe87bc544fb98a06c187ac","head":{"label":"kezhenxu94:cleanup/remove-duplicated-unused-method","ref":"cleanup/remove-duplicated-unused-method","sha":"e7c6fc97b9428264e7fe87bc544fb98a06c187ac","user":{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"bccac78e9f1473469e97bebccd516fafaab7e8a1","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/use

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-08T04:49:30Z","updated_at":"2019-02-11T08:31:44Z","closed_at":"2019-02-11T08:31:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bba256ca015ecfb0e6cb9cc0385a179b4a0c620c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3438/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3438/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3438/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c339921dbf01a03d9945055c527de142a5d7ffee","head":{"label":"wanghbxxxx:branch_addFunctionsWithVariableLengthArguments","ref":"branch_addFunctionsWithVariableLengthArguments","sha":"c339921dbf01a03d9945055c527de142a5d7ffee","user":{"login":"wanghbxxxx","id":6959062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTkwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6959062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx","html_url":"https://github.com/wanghbxxxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":168285473,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjgyODU0NzM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"wanghbxxxx/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wanghbxxxx","id":6959062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTkwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6959062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx","html_url":"https://github.com/wanghbxxxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wanghbxxxx/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-07T16:37:04Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T11:57:17Z","closed_at":"2019-02-11T03:15:28Z","merged_at":"2019-02-11T03:15:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"e9e176b1f11f106fbf96da6d8fc8d520871e63bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3437/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3437/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3437/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/08d5b279b1ea4718f78a80c0e28a79915a7f3b38","head":{"label":"dreamer-nitj:topic_enhance_dubbo-container","ref":"topic_enhance_dubbo-container","sha":"08d5b279b1ea4718f78a80c0e28a79915a7f3b38","user":{"login":"dreamer-nitj","id":7432448,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MzI0NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7432448?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj","html_url":"https://github.com/dreamer-nitj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":169597297,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjk1OTcyOTc=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"dreamer-nitj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dreamer-nitj","id":7432448,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MzI0NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7432448?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj","html_url":"https://github.com/dreamer-nitj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreamer-nitj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dreamer-nitj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n使AbstractClient的close操作和connect、disconnect操作一样，受到锁的保护，降低由于操作冲突而产生不确定性的概率；connect操作先判断client的close状态，如果client已经关闭，那么该client不需要重连。\r\n\r\nThe AbstractClient close operation is the same as the connect and disconnect operations, and is protected by the lock, which reduces the probability of uncertainty due to operation conflicts; the connect operation first determines the close state of the client. If the client is closed, the client does not need to be reconnected.\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-03T15:34:11Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T15:53:56Z","closed_at":"2019-02-03T15:38:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"868b7235c68757298b2c70ff0f84cd539e7e917c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3434/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3434/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3434/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/743bbe25abfcf43ade3ef4604f328e0af6e85715","head":{"label":"manzhizhen:opti_client_close","ref":"opti_client_close","sha":"743bbe25abfcf43ade3ef4604f328e0af6e85715","user":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1a88b32800a3a6310e44b5f11f2409e37c9878ae","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

If the client is closed, the client does not need to be reconnected. \r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-03T13:16:19Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T15:29:31Z","closed_at":"2019-02-03T15:27:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8082993c1af70cf49d4f9819a1c10dd321810686","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3432/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3432/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3432/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1da98f7379f1913110f7c3b448801615486f671d","head":{"label":"manzhizhen:opti_close","ref":"opti_close","sha":"1da98f7379f1913110f7c3b448801615486f671d","user":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1a88b32800a3a6310e44b5f11f2409e37c9878ae","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-03T03:22:05Z","updated_at":"2019-07-09T02:21:54Z","closed_at":"2019-03-08T09:05:28Z","merged_at":"2019-03-08T09:05:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"8683da7231282ff8ab540e29752b46b1183cda6a","assignee":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3430/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3430/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3430/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ab403350c09ac3b1ef7646dcdbff36b314e34b37","head":{"label":"chickenlj:multicast-ipv6-26x","ref":"multicast-ipv6-26x","sha":"ab403350c09ac3b1ef7646dcdbff36b314e34b37","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-02T16:24:35Z","updated_at":"2019-05-15T11:25:10Z","closed_at":"2019-05-15T11:25:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15f91033a7d1e0a89f637d4afa1f8b9832c55b0f","assignee":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25/labels","id":4111000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDExMTAwMA==","number":25,"title":"2.7.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_ur

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-02T07:43:36Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T11:55:48Z","closed_at":"2019-02-11T08:44:42Z","merged_at":"2019-02-11T08:44:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"caac0b573c8f87d0147983c149d5f7d96db2b20c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3424/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3424/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3424/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b744dcafa6836769bc17dc7f35eafc94db1b4a17","head":{"label":"wanghbxxxx:branch_refactorJavassistCompiler","ref":"branch_refactorJavassistCompiler","sha":"b744dcafa6836769bc17dc7f35eafc94db1b4a17","user":{"login":"wanghbxxxx","id":6959062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTkwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6959062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx","html_url":"https://github.com/wanghbxxxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":168285473,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjgyODU0NzM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"wanghbxxxx/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wanghbxxxx","id":6959062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTkwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6959062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx","html_url":"https://github.com/wanghbxxxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wanghbxxxx/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache
