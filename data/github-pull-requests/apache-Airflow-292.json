Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1619\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes: Add parameter to set the time in seconds to sleep between polling GCP for the dataflow job status while the job is in the JOB_STATE_RUNNING state. Allows for a more reasonable poll interval than the previously hard coded 10 seconds for long running jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: Added to tests/contrib/operators/test_dataflow_operator.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1613\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n- In Python 3, `map` returns an iterator, which exhaust after one iteration. Convert to list for re-use.\r\n- Use `mode='w'` instead of default `'w+b'` so it doesn't throw a type error.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-14T20:20:08Z","updated_at":"2017-09-14T21:41:51Z","closed_at":"2017-09-14T21:35:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0823d46007c19474be397df45793642e6cfdf469","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2609/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2609/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2609/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/6dbb2017e348af677fe26c03dbfab4eb1d553680","head":{"label":"jgao54:make-MySqlToGoogleCloudStorageOperator-python3-compaitible","ref":"make-MySqlToGoogleCloudStorageOperator-python3-compaitible","sha":"6dbb2017e348af677fe26c03dbfab4eb1d553680","user":{"login":"jgao54","id":17896160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk2MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17896160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54","html_url":"https://github.com/jgao54","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54232830,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDIzMjgzMA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"jgao54/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jgao54","id":17896160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk2MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17896160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54","html_url":"https://github.com/jgao54","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jgao54/airflow","description":"Airflow

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1600\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nChanged the import error handler in get_fernet to explicitly reference exceptions.ImportError, as ImportError is redefined later in the module. I also fixed several classes in models.py that were using self.logger without including LoggingMixin.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1595\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nSqliteHook is built using the host attribute of connection, but correctly we should use the schema attribute. The connection created from URI has no host attribute.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n* tests/hooks/test_sqlite_hook.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-12T11:22:33Z","updated_at":"2018-12-17T23:52:30Z","closed_at":"2018-12-17T23:52:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"968ed81a084d86f47230bf47e21553763a5c8bbc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

We don't want to install the tests packages into the python path, so exclude those.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] No tests needed, it is a change to setup.py which can't be tested.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1591\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFrom looking through the code it appears that the logging file_task_handler expects the TaskInstance to contain a reference to it's task object.\r\n\r\nI found another example in the code of the task being set on a TaskInstance after it has been retrieved from the db, and doing so here fixes this issue.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo current unit test coverage here to be updated.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

The real value is only stored in XCom when the size is less than 1GB, avoiding a PostgreSQL \"invalid request size error\". When size is higher than 1GB, a default string (\"This is a false value. The real value was too big to be saved\") is stored instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI did not add a test on the code I added because it would imply using an object which size will be higher than 1GB. I am afraid this would slow down the project build.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-11T17:07:44Z","updated_at":"2018-06-24T15:42:11Z","closed_at":"2018-06-24T15:42:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ff863c00f97299f52686aca17237b9ae903cb9c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2593/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2593/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2593/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/e2aef9b6fedf636d38f2d0a5177f01a869755bce","head":{"label":"rfrenoy:airflow-1583","ref":"airflow-1583","sha":"e2aef9b6fedf636d38f2d0a5177f01a869755bce","user":{"login":"rfrenoy","id":12834432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODM0NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12834432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfrenoy","html_url":"https://github.com/rfrenoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfrenoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfrenoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfrenoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfrenoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfrenoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfrenoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfrenoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfrenoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfrenoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"4ce25029524e10770c9047ec04d3ab9c6e257cf4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1586\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `FIELD_TYPE.DATE` as a mapping for MySQL to BigQuery data types conversion.\r\n\r\nSeems like this was just a simple oversight in the section of `airflow/contrib/operators/mysql_to_gcs.py` where the types get converted. In `convert_types` both `date` and `datetime` types get converted to timestamps but in `type_map` there is no mapping for `FIELD_TYPE.DATE`. This small bug almost turned my team off from using airflow because we had a lot of tables that didn't flow into BigQuery because we used the `date` type a lot.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI did not see a test for the `MySqlToGoogleCloudStorageOperator` and it was not obvious to me how to create one. I would be happy to create one if someone can give me some guidance to get me started. I figured this was a good reason not to create a test.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1560\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, (No UI Changes):\r\n\r\nThe PR addresses airflow integration with AWS Dynamodb.  \r\n\r\nCurrently there is no hook to interact with DynamoDb for reading or writing items (single or batch insertions). To get started, we want to push data in DynamoDB using airflow jobs (scheduled daily). Idea is to read aggregates from Hive and push in DynamoDB (write data job will run everyday to make this happen). First we want to create DynamoDB hooks (this PR addressed the same) and then create operator to move data from Hive to DynamoDB.\r\nhttp://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/dynamodb.html#service-resource\r\n\r\nSomething to think about - *Performance*\r\nI think airflow's generic approach for reading all data from source and then transferring to the destination by either storing source data in memory or disk is not the best optimized approach (in cases of big data with potential performance issues). When I started my initial design - I categorized it into 2 use cases a) small data b) big data.. The operators written in airflow code right now mostly handle small data (so does this PR). My approach would be to start with this operator (small data) and then handle big data use case if we see performance issues. I have some thoughts on how we can handle big data operations (using batching mechanism). For instance: \r\n\r\n1. Fetch all distinct id's (primary key) from source \r\n2. Create N buckets and assign bucket number to all the id's\r\n3. For each bucket : fetch data from source and then insert into destination. \r\n\r\nPlan to handle this in subsequent PR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething to think about - *Other ways of transferring data from hive to dynamodb*\r\n\r\nThere can be multiple ways for this data transfer to occur and here are some of the thoughts on current design decisions (KISS - keep it simple and sweet):\r\n\r\n1. Lambda function : You can write a lambda function to transfer data and trigger the function using AwsLambdaHook (https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2570) but lambda lifetime is 5 mins and if the data transfer takes longer lambda will die.\r\n\r\n2. Amazon Ecosystem (Amazon EMR, Big Data Pipeline, AWS Glue): Not to forget adding these systems create additional complexities (aws dependencies, aws limits, system complexities, IAM issues, airflow integrations with additonal dependencies and ofcourse $$)\r\n \r\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBPipeline.html\r\n\r\n3. Not to forget insertions in dynamodb are tricky because of WCU's and boto handles the insertions gracefully by automatically throttling insertions (buffering etc)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests :\r\n\r\n1. test_aws_hook.py\r\nadds mock_dynamodb2 from moto (https://github.com/spulec/moto). Wrote a test case to get aws resource object for dynamodb and create table via resource object and assert if count of items in table is 0 (implies table was created).\r\n\r\n2. test_dynamodb_hook.py\r\nadds mock_dynamodb2 from moto (https://github.com/spulec/moto). Wrote a test case to get aws resource object for dynamodb and create/insert data in dynamodb table. Then this unit test writes 10 items in the table using write_batch_data operation \r\n\r\n3. HiveToDynamoDBTransferTest\r\nthis unit test checks the workings of HiveToDynamoDB operator by inserting 1 record in dynamodb table via write operation.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    \r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1579\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n1. Facilitates the job option allowJaggedRows available in the api, that has not been included in the BQ hook.\r\n1. Updates the GoogleCloudStorageToBigQueryOperator operator to reflect these updates.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis PR does not need testing because:\r\n1. This PR matches the pattern of the other parameters available in the BQ hook. Many of these parameters do not have tests. These include quote_character, allow_quoted_newlines, max_bad_records, skipleadingrows and more.\r\n1. This PR will not affect any api calls unless allow_jagged_rows is set to true. Therefore, this is not a breaking change for anyone currently using this Operator or Hook.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\nJIRA\r\n\r\n*  My PR addresses [AIRFLOW-743](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-743)\r\nDescription\r\n\r\n*  * Bind to LDAP server using the user and password of the user logging in.\r\n\r\n* Apply a template to the user name such that the one matching the LDAP DN can be used.\r\nTests\r\n\r\n*  My PR adds the following unit tests OR does not need testing for this extremely good reason: no test at the moment exist for contributed security backends\r\nCommits\r\n\r\n*  My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"How to write a good git commit message\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-08T05:46:15Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T17:48:28Z","closed_at":"2019-11-27T17:48:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"512e0148c995d5706a87a2baff765fdee9cfbf07","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-07T10:59:59Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T13:35:05Z","closed_at":"2017-09-19T13:35:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2162a6345fb370d3d4b570ab505ab8ac161009c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2578/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2578/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2578/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/871fd2a0fc65ba697a42b1f75795c6040e71b447","head":{"label":"mrkm4ntr:airflow-1564","ref":"airflow-1564","sha":"871fd2a0fc65ba697a42b1f75795c6040e71b447","user":{"login":"mrkm4ntr","id":6421289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjEyODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6421289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr","html_url":"https://github.com/mrkm4ntr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":99537907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5OTUzNzkwNw==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"mrkm4ntr/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mrkm4ntr","id":6421289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjEyODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6421289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr","html_url":"https://github.com/mrkm4ntr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrkm4ntr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mrkm4ntr/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-1574] add 'to' attribute to templated variables of email operator\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1574\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe to field may sometimes want to be to be template-able when you have a DAG that is using XCOM to find the user to send the information to (i.e. we have a form that a user submits and based on the ldap user we send this specific user the information). It's a rather easy fix to add the 'to' user to the template-able options.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nJust adding a template-able field nothing more.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-07T03:12:53Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T19:59:25Z","closed_at":"2017-09-07T18:54:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e49972b6ae0cb34996b6bb3d0afba931ce0a7408","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2577/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2577/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2577/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/04e229a61b3198cb35acb4fc173c9a3bc752bc2a","head":{"label":"Acehaidrey:AIRFLOW-1574","ref":"AIRFLOW-1574","sha":"04e229a61b3198cb35acb4fc173c9a3bc752bc2a","user":{"login":"Acehaidrey","id":10408007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDA4MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10408007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey","html_url":"https://github.com/Acehaidrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94568127,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDU2ODEyNw==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"Acehaidrey/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Acehaidrey","id":10408007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDA4MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10408007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey","html_url":"https://github.com/Acehaidrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Acehaidrey/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - [AIRFLOW-966 Celery Broker Transport Options](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-966)\r\n    - [AIRFLOW-1555 Backfill job gets killed 1 hour after starting](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1555) will be fixed by being able to specify this\r\n    - [AIRFLOW-1131 DockerOperator jobs time out and get stuck in \"running\" forever](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1131) might be fixed by being able to specify this, at least in some cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- Expose a new config option to set `BROKER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS` on the CeleryConfig object.\r\n- Add a section to the docs about how to set this, and where it might be needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] I have added a new test file that adds some simple tests against the CeleryConfig object.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1567\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe underlying APIs are named Google ML Engine API in the release version (unlike in beta), \r\nso we renamed the files and classes/methods to match. \r\nAlso repositioned some input arguments to be more consistent.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nRan the existing tests for operators/hooks.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1564\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWe had some problems with the filename used for logging. Azure fileshares use windows backed machines, which do not support colons in the filename. Modified the logging filename rendering to use jinja2 and hence be more flexible. Allowing us to replace the colons by dots using jijna2.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nCovered by existing tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-05T14:50:22Z","updated_at":"2017-09-06T11:42:00Z","closed_at":"2017-09-06T11:42:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eccc5668e8d73ced8dc03adea60a40543ddbfb12","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2565/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2565/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2565/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/b346b3dd1a77322a84200df419c1392071c1af5a","head":{"label":"NielsZeilemaker:AIRFLOW-1564","ref":"AIRFLOW-1564","sha":"b346b3dd1a77322a84200df419c1392071c1af5a","user":{"login":"NielsZeilemaker","id":3777585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Nzc1ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3777585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker","html_url":"https://github.com/NielsZeilemaker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":89462053,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4OTQ2MjA1Mw==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"NielsZeilemaker/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NielsZeilemaker","id":3777585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Nzc1ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3777585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker","html_url":"https://github.com/NielsZeilemaker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NielsZeilemaker/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1560\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, (No UI Changes):\r\n\r\nThe PR addresses airflow integration with AWS Dynamodb.  \r\n\r\nCurrently there is no hook to interact with DynamoDb for reading or writing items (single or batch insertions). To get started, we want to push data in DynamoDB using airflow jobs (scheduled daily). Idea is to read aggregates from Hive and push in DynamoDB (write data job will run everyday to make this happen). First we want to create DynamoDB hooks (this PR addressed the same) and then create operator to move data from Hive to DynamoDB.\r\nhttp://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/dynamodb.html#service-resource\r\n\r\nSomething to think about - *Performance*\r\nI think airflow's generic approach for reading all data from source and then transferring to the destination by either storing source data in memory or disk is not the best optimized approach (in cases of big data with potential performance issues). When I started my initial design - I categorized it into 2 use cases a) small data b) big data.. The operators written in airflow code right now mostly handle small data (so does this PR). My approach would be to start with this operator (small data) and then handle big data use case if we see performance issues. I have some thoughts on how we can handle big data operations (using batching mechanism). For instance: \r\n\r\n1. Fetch all distinct id's (primary key) from source \r\n2. Create N buckets and assign bucket number to all the id's\r\n3. For each bucket : fetch data from source and then insert into destination. \r\n\r\nPlan to handle this in subsequent PR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething to think about - *Other ways of transferring data from hive to dynamodb*\r\n\r\nThere can be multiple ways for this data transfer to occur and here are some of the thoughts on current design decisions (KISS - keep it simple and sweet):\r\n\r\n1. Lambda function : You can write a lambda function to transfer data and trigger the function using AwsLambdaHook (https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2570) but lambda lifetime is 5 mins and if the data transfer takes longer lambda will die.\r\n\r\n2. Amazon Ecosystem (Amazon EMR, Big Data Pipeline, AWS Glue): Not to forget adding these systems create additional complexities (aws dependencies, aws limits, system complexities, IAM issues, airflow integrations with additonal dependencies and ofcourse $$)\r\n \r\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBPipeline.html\r\n\r\n3. Not to forget insertions in dynamodb are tricky because of WCU's and boto handles the insertions gracefully by automatically throttling insertions (buffering etc)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests :\r\n\r\n1. test_aws_hook.py\r\nadds mock_dynamodb2 from moto (https://github.com/spulec/moto). Wrote a test case to get aws resource object for dynamodb and create table via resource object and assert if count of items in table is 0 (implies table was created).\r\n\r\n2. test_dynamodb_hook.py\r\nadds mock_dynamodb2 from moto (https://github.com/spulec/moto). Wrote a test case to get aws resource object for dynamodb and create/insert data in dynamodb table. Then this unit test writes 10 items in the table using write_batch_data operation \r\n\r\n3. HiveToDynamoDBTransferTest\r\nthis unit test checks the workings of HiveToDynamoDB operator by inserting 1 record in dynamodb table via write operation.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-03T18:51:12Z","updated_at":"2017-09-08T22:33:52Z","closed_at":"2017-09-08T22:28:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"17ec4873d188c39f13e23d76efc2ace829401990","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2560/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2560/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2560/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/08bc9a2eb7dcd984e9ea260d17c7c47b354a2714","head":{"label":"sid88in:feature/dynamodb_hooks","ref":"feature/dynamodb_hooks","sha":"08bc9a2eb7dcd984e9ea260d17c7c47b354a2714","user":{"login":"sid88in","id":1587005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODcwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1587005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in","html_url":"https://github.com/sid88in","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":102280065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDIyODAwNjU=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"sid88in/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sid88in","id":1587005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODcwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1587005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in","html_url":"https://github.com/sid88in","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sid88in/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1527\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis creates a new key entry `celery_config_module` in `airflow.cfg` file to enable custom celery configurations to be loaded into the CeleryApp. By default, the celeryapp will use the `default_celery` module. Users can use a custom configuration module by setting `celery_config_module` to the import path of their custom module.\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution that celery allows is to set the environment variable http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/application.html#config-from-envvar but this PR makes it much clearer for airflow users that the celery configuration can be configurable.\r\n\r\nThere is another PR open that tries to achieve the same thing but I'm afraid it isn't clear on how a user can modify the celery configuration https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2542#issuecomment-325018124. It also includes a couple of unexpected tweaks that users may not want such as forcing airflow users to upgrade to celery 4. Since the celery config keys in celery 4 is backwards compatible with celery 3, we don't need to update them just yet. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI couldn't find any existing Celery tests. For the most part, this is a refactor with most of the code remaining the same and changes only to the `celery_exector`.  I've manually tested using a custom configuration module and the default one to make sure the webserver/scheduler/worker still schedules and runs jobs.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-01T21:19:27Z","updated_at":"2017-09-28T15:33:18Z","closed_at":"2017-09-28T15:33:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"31f486c6aab8016394c2a07f5a43145dc2b4ebe3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2558/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2558/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2558/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/378b93ea5cd12127ccd7df3d5463b15322964ef5","head":{"label":"wongwill86:refactor_celery","ref":"refactor_celery","sha":"378b93ea5cd12127ccd7df3d5463b15322964ef5","user":{"login":"wongwill86","id":1668987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njg5ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1668987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86","html_url":"https://github.com/wongwill86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":101917068,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDE5MTcwNjg=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"wongwill86/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wongwill86","id":1668987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njg5ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1668987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86","html_url":"https://github.com/wongwill86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wongwill86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wongwill86/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow 1556](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1556/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1556\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nBigQuery supports running parameterized queries (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/parameterized-queries).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds this parameter to the BigQueryOperator, and the BigQueryBaseCursor, which sets this field on the query configuration prior to the api call.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThis PR adds a parameter and plumbs it through a couple of classes before setting it on the api. It's hard to test this given that there is no prior test coverage of the classes being changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-31T23:29:39Z","updated_at":"2017-09-01T19:59:59Z","closed_at":"2017-09-01T19:59:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ec8ab3867079b80b5871fbfad3c29f501cde9e2f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2557/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2557/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2557/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/f0512340017e0890507e90b537c8938a63ecbe4b","head":{"label":"rajivpb:sql-parameters","ref":"sql-parameters","sha":"f0512340017e0890507e90b537c8938a63ecbe4b","user":{"login":"rajivpb","id":4618540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MTg1NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4618540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb","html_url":"https://github.com/rajivpb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100427923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA0Mjc5MjM=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"rajivpb/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rajivpb","id":4618540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MTg1NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4618540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb","html_url":"https://github.com/rajivpb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajivpb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rajivpb/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

a new operator to trigger job on jenkins.\r\nA new connection type has also been added with it's companion hook.\r\n\r\nNo test are written yet as I don't know how to write test in Python, but definitely interested by example or how to to add some. \r\n\r\nDear Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA 1551 ](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1551\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAdd a new connection type to configure jenkins connection. This type of connection takes the following parameters : \r\n- host\r\n- login\r\n- api token/password (both can be used)\r\n- port\r\n\r\nThis connection is associated to a hook to build the Jenkins object (from python-jenkins library)\r\n\r\nAn operator allows to trigger job on the remote jenkins. It accept parameters as a python dict or as a file (which should contains the python dict). The parameters are declared as template field to allow usage of macros in them. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nOne test written for the operator, but it doesn't seem triggered and I don't know why. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1465\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn Python 3, the example on https://airflow.incubator.apache.org/profiling.html#chart-screenshot fails with the error message like `1496268000000 is not JSON serializable` or `Object of type 'int64' is not JSON serializable`.\r\nThe `numpy.int64` values can't be converted to native types in `df[col].index.tolist()`, but `df[col].index.get_values()` returns `pandas.Series` and `pandas.Series.tolist()` can convert them to native types.\r\nSee below.\r\n* https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/core/indexes/base.py#L572\r\n* https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/core/series.py#L1124\r\n\r\n![chart error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6421289/29811284-e7141a5a-8cdd-11e7-8e4a-83d94b85c89c.png)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThere are no tests of rendering chart originally, and that's hard to test.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-29T08:15:12Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T16:27:12Z","closed_at":"2019-09-11T16:27:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a9b844e1b3a9e0c15f538df00d0a247e837f232","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1541\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nOur company (unfortunately) doesn't stay consistent between ldap users and slack user id's, so we have to use a PythonOperator to get the slack user name and pass that via xcom. We want to DM the person on slack, and the channel field needs to be templated to run something like ```\"{{ task_instance.xcom_pull(task_ids='get_slack_userid') }}\"```\r\nThis PR is to allow for that.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nWe're simply adding a template field, so testing isn't necessary though could be done.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-29T00:17:20Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T19:59:39Z","closed_at":"2017-08-30T18:54:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"682ec9c72be8bcb29fec09a6ad1326f840e651ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2549/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2549/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2549/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/9c974c61b922724db0451be211043bc20e5dd41c","head":{"label":"Acehaidrey:AIRFLOW-1541","ref":"AIRFLOW-1541","sha":"9c974c61b922724db0451be211043bc20e5dd41c","user":{"login":"Acehaidrey","id":10408007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDA4MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10408007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey","html_url":"https://github.com/Acehaidrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94568127,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDU2ODEyNw==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"Acehaidrey/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Acehaidrey","id":10408007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDA4MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10408007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey","html_url":"https://github.com/Acehaidrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Acehaidrey/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n\r\nThis is a minor contribution to a Google contrib operator, and as such does not have a jira reference.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n1. Facilitates the job option `allowJaggedRows` available in the api, that has not been included in the BQ hook.\r\n1. Updates the GoogleCloudStorageToBigQueryOperator operator to reflect these updates.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis PR does not need testing because:\r\n\r\n1. This PR matches the pattern of the other parameters available in the BQ hook. Many of these parameters do not have tests. These include `quote_character`, `allow_quoted_newlines`, `max_bad_records`, `skipleadingrows` and more. \r\n1. This PR will not affect any api calls unless `allow_jagged_rows` is set to true.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [[AIRFLOW-1177] variable json deserialize does not work at set defaults](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1177)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Previously due to a logic error if you attempt to use `Variable.setdefault()` with `deserialize_json=True` and the value already existed it would die with:\r\n\r\n      ...\r\n          my = Variable.setdefault('regions', ['uk'], deserialize_json=True)\r\n        File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/airflow/models.py\", line 3623, in setdefault\r\n          return json.loads(obj.val)\r\n    AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'val'\r\n\r\n  The problem was that the `Variable.get()` call was returning the value, not a variable object.\r\n\r\n  This closes #2278 too. (The original author was requested to add tests and confirm with commit guidelines but hasn't done so in 3 months, and I ran in to this bug)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests: Extra case in core.py along side existing setdefault tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters (_a little longer, 67_)\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1491\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIf the scheduler (re)starts it will start from a clean slate.\r\nThis is not a problem for a synchronous executor (e.g. LocalExecutor),\r\nbut it is for an asynchronous one as worker might still be executing\r\ntasks, while the scheduler will requeue them.\r\n\r\nThis patch makes sure the queue is recovered from the workers, by\r\ninpsecting them.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nUnit tests for celery added. Working on the recovery method testing\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses [AIRFLOW-1433](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1433).\r\nThe full discussion of introducing RBAC to Airflow can be found in [this mailing list thread](https://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=dev@airflow.incubator.apache.org&q=subject:%22Re%5C%3A+Role+Based+Access+Control+for+Airflow+UI%22&o=newest).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR is not the complete diff, it contains the relevant files to illustrate how View-Level Access Control (VLAC) could be implemented with Flask-AppBuilder.\r\n\r\nI have a functional work-in-progress branch that contains the complete diff [here on this fork](https://github.com/jgao54/airflow/tree/fab). Note the entire FAB-based webserver app resides in `airflow-resource/airflow/www2`. The reason I didn't include it here is that most of the diffs are a copy of the files in `www/`, with modifications on HTML templates to make webserver compatible with FAB.\r\n\r\nYou could test out the FAB-based webserver with the following steps:\r\n1. clone the repo and check out the `fab` branch\r\n2. install Flask-AppBuilder in your virtual env\r\n`$ pip install flask-appbuilder`\r\n3. create an admin account\r\n`$ fabmanager create-admin`\r\n4. go to the www2/ directory\r\n`$ cd incubator-airflow/airflow/www2`\r\n5. start the webserver\r\n`$ fabmanager run`\r\n6. log in with the admin account you created\r\n7. to check out the read-only UI, you can go into the `Security` tab in the UI, create a new user with a Read-Only role, then log in with that user's credentials. \r\n\r\nSince it's still a work-in-progress, there are still some bugs in the UI. However, I'd love to get some feedback from the community around the overall approach +  toss some questions/thoughts below:\r\n\r\n- FAB’s security model has the concept of users, roles, permissions and views. There’s a table mapping permission to view, a table mapping permission_view to role, and another table mapping role to user. The current DLAC design proposes specifying user:perm mapping in the DAG file, which would implies dynamically inserting roles, and that's a bit complicated to implement. After talking with @criccomini, he suggested it would simplify this process if we use role:perm mapping instead.\r\n- Security.py is currently just a demo, it introduces a Read Only role that prevents all write/execute access. The [RBAC proposal](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+RBAC+proposal#AirflowRBACproposal-DagLevelAccessControl(DLAC)) has 5 default roles, but it would be useful to clarify what each role's default permissions should be (i.e. what's the difference between user and read-only roles)\r\n- I originally intended to share the static/ and template/ directories from www/, and just add conditionals whenever the frameworks diverge. However, given how much modifications are actually required, it was cleaner to replicate the whole thing and make change directly on the copy. This means until we rip out www/, we'll need to maintain both www/ and www2/ when making UI changes. \r\n- I tried to preserve the endpoints whenever possible (i.e. keeping the /admin route base) given there are many routes hardcoded into the html templates. However, if we no longer want to use /admin, we can change it.\r\n- The FAB-based webserver is currently pretty decoupled from the rest of airflow codebase, not to mention it has its own config file, eventually it needs to be integrated into airflow.cfg and the cli command.\r\n- There are still some modification required on the FAB Framework to make all the models/views work in Airflow (i.e. compound pks, formatted columns, etc.)\r\n\r\ncc: @mistercrunch  @bolkedebruin @criccomini

comma to avoid the template fields list to be interpreted as a list of characters\r\n\r\nDear Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1521\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAlmost no changes, just fix the list of template_fields for bigquery_table_delete_operator. A PR added the deleted_table_field to the list, but python interpret the list as a list of character as it contains only one string. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo new test written as I don't know how to write test for operators (and more generally in python) but one could be added easily to check that render_template work properly on bigquery_table_delete_operator\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-18T20:51:47Z","updated_at":"2017-08-18T22:26:26Z","closed_at":"2017-08-18T22:26:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9ab5e2811a3ff7f1c0778eb6be1cf94e352f055a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2534/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2534/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2534/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/453c2234c86492b8cc10b7dd9fb94046e47bbb98","head":{"label":"moe-nadal-ck:AIRFLOW-1521/fix_table_delete_operator_template_fields_list","ref":"AIRFLOW-1521/fix_table_delete_operator_template_fields_list","sha":"453c2234c86492b8cc10b7dd9fb94046e47bbb98","user":{"login":"moe-nadal-ck","id":28959205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTU5MjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28959205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck","html_url":"https://github.com/moe-nadal-ck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100748832,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA3NDg4MzI=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"moe-nadal-ck/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"moe-nadal-ck","id":28959205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTU5MjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28959205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck","html_url":"https://github.com/moe-nadal-ck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/moe-nadal-ck/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1519\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAirflow's main page previously did paging client-side via a\r\njQuery plugin (DataTable) which was very slow at loading all DAGs.\r\nThe browser would load all DAGs in the table.\r\nThe result was performance degradation when having a number of\r\nDAGs in the range of 1K.\r\n\r\nThis commit implements server-side paging using the webserver page\r\nsize setting, sending to the browser only the elements for the\r\nspecific page.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in order to get functionality parity with the search on the client side, a typeahead (auto-complete) component has been added:\r\n![screen shot 2017-09-11 at 2 38 09 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/266670/30298137-1cbec5a8-96ff-11e7-8e53-acbdc9b53551.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUI changes tested manually.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n@aoen \r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1495\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThere was a merge conflict on the migration hash for down revision\r\nat the time that two commits including migrations were merged.\r\n\r\nThis commit restores the chain of revisions for the migrations,\r\npointing to the last one. The job_id index migration was regenerated\r\nfrom the top migration.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThis is a fix for a migration that was already merged.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow 1508](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1508) issues regarding of the skipped state missing from the task_states.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn the `airflow.state` module, `State.task_states` doesn't include the `SKIPPED` state even though the `TaskInstance` object has it. I believe this is a bug and have filed a JIRA for it.\r\nI also did a thorough check for usages of this method and it's only used in [views.py](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/www/views.py#L560) in the `task_stats` function. By making the amend, all that will happen is we add another stat in the payload. The below code from the file does this and appends it.\r\n```\r\n                d = {\r\n                    'state': state,\r\n                    'count': count,\r\n                    'dag_id': dag.dag_id,\r\n                    'color': State.color(state)\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nMy case doesn't really need any tests because we're simply adding a single line of a new state the the `task_states` object. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1504\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n- Logs the substituted cluster_name in DataprocClusterCreateOperator and DataprocClusterDeleteOperator when they begin execution, making it easier to interpret errors mentioned in the Jira issue. The log is of the form \"Creating cluster: \\<cluster-name>\" and \"Deleting cluster: \\<cluster-name>\"\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- test.contrib.operators.test_dataproc_operator:DataprocClusterCreateOperatorTest.test_cluster_name_log_no_sub\r\n- test.contrib.operators.test_dataproc_operator:DataprocClusterCreateOperatorTest.test_cluster_name_log_sub\r\n- test.contrib.operators.test_dataproc_operator:DataprocClusterDeleteOperatorTest.test_cluster_name_log_no_sub\r\n- test.contrib.operators.test_dataproc_operator:DataprocClusterDeleteOperatorTest.test_cluster_name_log_sub\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1507\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n       Our use case requires 'src' and 'dst' parameters in the file_to_gcs operator to be able to parse \r\n       templates. Apart from 'src' and 'dst', having the 'bucket' parameter also to be one of the \r\n       templated parameters would be useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: This has been tested locally. This is a simple change that just marks the 'src', 'dst' and \r\n             'bucket' parameters of file_to_gcs operator to be templated fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not
