What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nFor several years, Zeppelin has supported both the old and new UIs, with the old UI remaining as the default.\r\nHowever, as the new UI offers a more modern design, I believe it might be beneficial to consider making it the default interface.\r\n\r\n#### Rationale\r\nThe new UI presents a more contemporary user experience, which could align better with users' expectations today.\r\nTransitioning to the new UI as the default may help in keeping Zeppelin more up-to-date and user-friendly.\r\nOf course, I am aware that this change might impact various parts of the project, so I propose we carefully review this before proceeding.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Update all references to the web app context paths.\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN/6064\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n- Verify that the new UI is accessible via root path.\r\n- Ensure the old UI can still be accessed via `/classic`.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No, but it may affect users' accustomed access paths.\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Maybe it would be helpful to provide guidance on how users could access the old UI under the new path, especially for those accustomed to the previous default. However, I'm not entirely sure if this is the best approach, so I haven't added any documentation for now.","created_at":"2024-08-25T11:06:50Z","updated_at":"2024-09-03T09:47:29Z","closed_at":"2024-09-03T09:47:28Z","merged_at":"2024-09-03T09:47:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"7708b7150c71d1d3beb6d613e82a8f09800e5e08","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4802/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4802/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4802/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/c65e02f4813026c5d4b7f2f82a391641a57b1032","head":{"label":"tbonelee:change-default-ui","ref":"change-default-ui","sha":"c65e02f4813026c5d4b7f2f82a391641a57b1032","user":{"login":"tbonelee","id":81022113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDIyMTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81022113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee","html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":808220072,"node_id":"R_kgDOMCx1qA","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"tbonelee/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tbonelee","id":81022113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDIyMTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81022113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee","html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nIn new UI, the results are rendered only after some interactions, such as a click on the other paragraph.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue by ensuring immediate rendering of the results when they are set in the `ngAfterViewInit` lifecycle hook. Previously, `markForCheck()` was used after setting `this.innerHTML`, which scheduled the component to be checked in the next change detection cycle but did not trigger an immediate update.\r\nThis has been changed to `detectChanges()` to force an immediate change detection, ensuring that the results are rendered right after they are set, without needing further user interaction.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN/6063\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n- Run any paragraph in new UI\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\n![Aug-23-2024 19-59-47](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bce85eba-7672-423f-b66b-b8f433216617)\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\n![Aug-23-2024 20-27-01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27beb526-fcbd-4f46-9e21-c3a6f8a720b7)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update?

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR aims to enhance the build process in Zeppelin by integrating Thrift Java file generation into the Maven build workflow. It also updates the `genthrift.sh` script to automatically handle Thrift installation. These changes are intended to reduce manual errors and ensure consistent build environments.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Add `exec-maven-plugin` to `pom.xml` to automate the generation of Java files from Thrift IDL during the Maven build process.\r\n* [x] - Enhance `genthrift.sh` to support automatic Thrift installation, including improved checks for Thrift being installed.\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ZEPPELIN/issues/ZEPPELIN-6060\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1. Verify Thrift installation\r\n2. Confirm Thrift .java file generation through Maven\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? NO\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? NO\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR adds a Dockerfile to build a JDBC interpreter container. It’s the second interpreter to be dockerized, after the shell interpreter (#4781). Like I said in the previous PR, the configuration and testing are a little complex at the moment. I plan to improve this in future work.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nFeature\r\n### Todos\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-6048](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-6048)\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Build and run the docker container\r\n* Verify that the jdbc interpreter container communicates with the zeppelin server\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? Yes\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Yes.

I think it would be more helpful for users to recognize and resolve the issues on their own.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n* Improvement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-6051\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Create a notebook that can't be parsed and try to open it.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nas-is\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-12 at 01 15 41\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5ad7493-dff6-4c20-b6ab-2866abe1f89e\">\r\n\r\n~~to-be~~\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-12 at 01 14 15\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3098b6e-7e2a-4848-b68b-eef25015d288\">\r\n\r\nto-be\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0797e617-1a8c-473e-99ea-a4be3429dbf9\">\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update?

behavior\r\n* Outline any manual steps to test the PR here.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? \r\n* Is there breaking changes

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR modifies the notebook listing logic to exclude hidden files that start with `.`. \r\nThis is because showing non-executable files, such as meta files, could confuse users, as seen in this issue [ZEPPELIN-6051](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-6051).\r\n\r\nAdditionally I have enhanced the error popup message to be more specific, which appears when a user opens a notebook with parsing errors. I think it would be more helpful for users to recognize and resolve the issues on their own.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n* Improvement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-6051\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Create a notebook that can't be parsed and try to open it.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nas-is\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-12 at 01 15 41\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5ad7493-dff6-4c20-b6ab-2866abe1f89e\">\r\n\r\n~~to-be~~\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-12 at 01 14 15\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3098b6e-7e2a-4848-b68b-eef25015d288\">\r\n\r\nto-be\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0797e617-1a8c-473e-99ea-a4be3429dbf9\">\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update?

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR aims to refactor several parts of the Zeppelin project codebase to eliminate no-invalid-this warnings reported by ESLint. These warnings indicate that the this keyword is being used in ways that might lead to unexpected behavior or bugs, particularly within nested callbacks or when this loses its intended context. By addressing these warnings, we improve the stability, readability, and maintainability of the codebase.\r\n\r\n**Note on `note-action.service.js`**:\r\nInitially, I aimed to refactor `note-action.service.js` to eliminate ESLint warnings. However, during testing, it was found that the note actions on the default page were not displaying correctly after the changes. To ensure the stability of the project, I have reverted the changes made to `note-action.service.js`. I plan to revisit this refactor to address the ESLint warnings while ensuring no issues arise in the build process.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nRefactoring\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Resolve ESLint warnings of files in zeppelin-web/src/app\r\n* [ ] - Resolve ESLint warnings of files in zeppelin-web/src/components\r\n* [x] - Check if project compiles successfully\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-6054](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-6054)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* CI\r\n* Build and run \r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n*Current Warnings*:\r\n<img width=\"1102\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a928656-ec97-4553-a12c-2cd0fbd46350\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? - No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? - No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? -

What is this PR for?\r\n- Fix : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-6052\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n---\r\nCurrently, the Zeppelin web application uses Webpack for its build tools. Webpack provides valuable features like hot module replacement (HMR) through webpack-dev-server, which greatly enhances the development experience by automatically updating the UI in response to code changes.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, hot module replacement is not functioning properly, impacting the developer experience, particularly on the frontend (zeppelin-web).\r\n\r\nResolution\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo resolve this issue, I updated webpack-dev-server from version ^3.1.10 to ^4.15.2. This update was selected as the latest version compatible with Webpack version 4.\r\n\r\n- Version Upgrade: Although I considered further upgrades, I chose the latest version compatible with Webpack version 4. I plan to migrate to Webpack version 5 incrementally.\r\n- Dependencies: The updated version 4.15.2 requires @webpack-cli/serve version ^1.2.0, which necessitated the installation of webpack-cli@4.x.x. Consequently, I installed webpack-cli@4.10.0 too.\r\n- Configuration Changes: Due to BREAKING CHANGES introduced by the new version, modifications were required in the webpack.config.js to accommodate these updates. I followed [this migration guide](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/master/migration-v4.md).\r\n\r\nAS-IS\r\n---\r\n![화면 기록 2024-08-11 오후 3 14

-> 4.15.2)\r\n* [x] Install @webpack-cli/serve \r\n* [x] Upgrade webpack-cli (3.3.12 -> 4.10.0)\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-6053\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n```\r\n1. git clone latest code.\r\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/zeppelin.git\r\n\r\n2. change directory to zeppelin-web\r\ncd zeppelin-web\r\n\r\n3. install dependencies\r\nnpm install\r\n\r\n4. run dev mode\r\nnpm run dev\r\n\r\n5. modify any codes you want to see the change (I'd recommend <H1/> simply)\r\n- 1. move to zeppelin-web/src/app/home.html\r\n- 2. change any html codes you can easily detect\r\n\r\n6. you can check it doesn't update UI automatically. you should reload instead.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update?\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?\r\n* Does this needs

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\n(reopned PR https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4785)\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n---\r\nWhen using markdown interpreter, It supposed to support [mathematical format](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/latest/usage/display_system/basic.html#mathematical-expressions).\r\nBut loading MathJax(JS lib for mathematical formatting) was failed.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n---\r\nIn the build process of zeppelin-web project, a Grunt task named copy is used to transfer files from one directory to another. This task is important for ensuring that necessary files, particularly those within node_modules, are correctly placed where they are needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8983447-4c14-4114-8ecf-3453b807fc53\">\r\n\r\n_(zeppelin-web/Gruntfile.js)_\r\n\r\nHowever, an issue has arisen where files from the node_modules/MathJax/** directory were not being copied as expected. Upon investigation, it was found that this was due to a change in the directory structure of MathJax after upgrading from version 2.7.9 to 3.0.0, as managed by Dependabot. (8de680402711681c16a2aefb2f737bc5aa050d78)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"666\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/074ef9d6-ba17-4ff0-9ebc-fbbf12846035\">\r\n\r\nResolution\r\n---\r\nTo address this issue, the following steps were taken:\r\n\r\n- Downgrade the dependency MathJax version from 3.0.0 to 2.7.9 to maintain compatibility with the directory structure expected by `Gruntfile.js`.\r\n- Ensured that the copy task in Grunt is correctly mapping and copying the files from the updated MathJax directory.\r\n\r\nAs-Is\r\n---\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"as-is\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d079f5ee-4238-4f1c-9dba-7fb365b173c9\">\r\n\r\nTo-Be\r\n---\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"to-be\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b546b944-febd-4a46-95e8-5516a2cc8ee8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] Downgrade MathJax from 3.0.0 to 2.7.9\r\n* [ ] Add Tests\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-6046\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Strongly recommended: add automated unit tests for any new or changed behavior\r\n* Outline any manual steps to test the PR here.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n---\r\nWhen using markdown interpreter, It supposed to support [mathematical format](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/latest/usage/display_system/basic.html#mathematical-expressions).\r\nBut loading MathJax(JS lib for mathematical formatting) was failed.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n---\r\nIn the build process of zeppelin-web project, a Grunt task named copy is used to transfer files from one directory to another. This task is important for ensuring that necessary files, particularly those within node_modules, are correctly placed where they are needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8983447-4c14-4114-8ecf-3453b807fc53\">\r\n\r\n_(zeppelin-web/Gruntfile.js)_\r\n\r\nHowever, an issue has arisen where files from the node_modules/MathJax/** directory were not being copied as expected. Upon investigation, it was found that this was due to a change in the directory structure of MathJax after upgrading from version 2.7.9 to 3.0.0, as managed by Dependabot.

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nWhen testing version 0.11.1 I found an unpleasant bug. The system is deployed in the kubernetes environment in conjunction with ha-proxy. Some time after starting work, error 1006 occurs - after which the socket is not created again - only refreshing the page helps. There is no such problem in version 0.10.1. \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n[ZEPPELIN-6026]\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-6026\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nI tested the problem in the k8s environment. With debug mode enabled in the browser. As soon as an error with code 1006 occurs, a new Websocket should be created without refreshing the page.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update?\r\nno\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?\r\nno\r\n* Does this needs documentation?\r\nno\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-07T09:48:21Z","updated_at":"2024-08-12T07:42:14Z","closed_at":"2024-08-12T07:42:14Z","merged_at":"2024-08-12T07:42:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"32a3be41b2d1bc3f941bb0f08268e4bf49fa4f9d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4784/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4784/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4784/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/d7e4287b51647efc6977e02c57a25968d3ec2698","head":{"label":"Armadik:master","ref":"master","sha":"d7e4287b51647efc6977e02c57a25968d3ec2698","user":{"login":"Armadik","id":50964282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTY0Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50964282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik","html_url":"https://github.com/Armadik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":839272475,"node_id":"R_kgDOMgZIGw","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"Armadik/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Armadik","id":50964282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTY0Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50964282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik","html_url":"https://github.com/Armadik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armadik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Armadik/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR adds a Dockerfile to build a shell interpreter. \r\nAlthough the interpreters are currently running as separate JVM processes, the existing structure confines them to a single machine, resulting in low availability. As a first step to address this, I've created a docker image for the shell interpreter using independent computing resources.\r\n\r\nSince the current system wasn't designed with modular operation in mind, this PR involves some complexities in terms of configuration and testing. I'm planning to dockerize the other interpreters too, and I’ll try to iron out these kinks as I go.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-6034](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-6034)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Build and run the docker container\r\n* Verify that the shell interpreter container communicates with the zeppelin server\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nSeveral issues have been identified with the \"docker\" run mode that are causing it to function improperly. Below are the specific problems encountered:\r\n #### Base Image Version Issue in `/scripts/docker/interpreter/Dockerfile`:\r\n\r\n- The base image version is outdated, currently at `0.8.0`, which is significantly behind the latest version.\r\n- The URL for downloading Spark is not working, causing failures in the build process.\r\n \r\n#### Host Environment Variables Overriding Container Environment Variables:\r\n\r\n-  The `JAVA_HOME` variable from the host is unnecessarily being passed to the container, potentially causing conflicts with the intended Java environment inside the container.\r\n- The `PATH` from the host is being propagated into the container, which may lead to unexpected behavior due to differing paths and binaries.\r\n- The `ZEPPELIN_HOME` variable from the host is also being passed, which can interfere with the Zeppelin environment within the container.\r\n\r\n #### Miscellaneous Issues:\r\n\r\n- Additional issues have been identified testing Spark interpreter, I will check for it in another PR\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n* [x] - Fix dockerfile\r\n* [ ] - Check for major interpreters\r\n  * [x] md\r\n  * [x] python\r\n  * [x] shell\r\n  * [x] R\r\n  * [ ] spark\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-6040\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n1. Build Zeppelin using the following command:\r\n    \r\n    ```bash\r\n    $ ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests -Pinclude-hadoop\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n2. Create the `conf/zeppelin-site.xml` file with the following content:\r\n    \r\n    ```xml\r\n    <configuration>\r\n      <property>\r\n        <name>zeppelin.run.mode</name>\r\n        <value>docker</value>\r\n        <description>Zeppelin run mode</description>\r\n      </property>\r\n      <property>\r\n        <name>zeppelin.docker.container.image</name>\r\n        <value>chanho0325/interpreter:0.11.2</value>\r\n        <description>'Docker image I've built with scripts/docker/interpreter/Dockerfile'</description>\r\n      </property>\r\n    </configuration>\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n4.

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nI have managed to run the Livy integration tests by rewriting the Livy Server bootstrap logic.\r\n\r\nAfter several attempts, I decided to use the following version combination for Livy integration test:\r\n\r\n- Python 3.7\r\n- Scala 2.11\r\n- Livy 0.8.0-incubating\r\n- Spark 2.4.8\r\n\r\nThe version combination is based on the facts:\r\n1. official Livy 0.8 binary tarball is built against Spark 2.4\r\n2. official Spark 2.4 binary tarball is built against Scala 2.11\r\n3. Spark 2.4 supports Python 2.7, 3.4 to 3.7\r\n\r\nThis PR also rewrite the Livy Server bootstrap logic, previously, it pulls Livy deps and relies on MiniLivyCluster, which also starts a MiniHDFS and MiniYARN, which is a so heavy approach.

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis is the third attemps of ZEPPELIN-5986, partial of this PR are credited to @Reamer, and I also got help from @zjffdu offline.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4699 (first attempt)\r\n- https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4725 (second attempt)\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n\r\nI found that some tests are skipped while tackling the Hadoop3 upgrading, and eventually I realized that was caused by the low version of maven-failsafe-plugin not supporting JUnit5 annotations.\r\n\r\nActually, maven-surefire-plugin(for UT) and maven-failsafe-plugin(for IT) are developed in the same [project](https://github.com/apache/maven-surefire) and they share the same release cycle thus have same versions.\r\n\r\n#### Changes of this PR\r\n\r\n1. upgrade these two plugins to the latest 3.2.2 to recover the IT written in JUnit5\r\n2. disable the broken Livy IT, see discussion in https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4725\r\n3. fix the broken `SparkIntegrationTest`, thanks @Reamer \r\n4. fix the broken Selenium Tests\r\n5. enhance `WebDriverManager`, to allow specify web browser for Selenium integration tests via `export ZEPPELIN_SELENIUM_BROWSER=[Chrome|Firefox|Safari]`\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\nTest.\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n* [ ] - Livy integration tests were broken, and is skipped in this PR.\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\nZEPPELIN-5986\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nPass GHA.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

sentences describing the overall goals of the pull request's commits.\r\nFirst time? Check out the contributing guide - https://zeppelin.apache.org/contribution/contributions.html\r\nWhen I am using the new Zeppelin interface for querying with jdbc or Spark SQL, the resulting table cannot display all the content.\r\nExample: If there is a MySQL table as follows.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/assets/23468656/cfd74ce8-d7c5-471a-bc9b-94d0b2bf9247)\r\nWhen using zeppelin jdbc queries, the following results will be obtained:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/assets/23468656/70affe07-d6d8-4081-a861-0de59ea4c8df)\r\nYou can see that only two fields are displayed.\r\nThe specific reason is that the use of excessively wide column widths resulted in the remaining fields being squeezed out of the screen, and nz table did not have a scroll bar set to display scrolling.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n*Please leave your type of PR only*\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\nThe solution is as follows:\r\n*  1. Add a horizontal scrollbar to the nz table of Angular JS by modifying it, so that the remaining fields can be displayed by scrolling.\r\n*  2. Adjust the column width to be too wide for better display.\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nNONE\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Strongly recommended: add automated unit tests for any new or changed behavior\r\n* Outline any manual steps to test the PR here.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/assets/23468656/a4f12c70-c7e4-42eb-954e-0fa8f2007d47)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/assets/23468656/1d2810d0-3a7c-41b2-8c04-4413ea05872c)\r\n\r\n###

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR removes the most important instance objects from Zeppelin.\r\nThis PR standardizes our integration tests via the `ZeppelinServerMini` class.\r\nI was previously unaware that the Zeppelin configuration is also used within interpreters. With these changes I noticed it and the Zeppelin configuration is now available to interpreters.\r\nI have tried to split the PR into meaningful commits. Unfortunately, it is not possible to split the PR further due to the mass of uses of the instance objects.\r\n\r\nThe `ZeppelinServerMini` class makes it easy to run integration tests in the IDE. Separate steps such as \"download Spark\", \"download Hadoop\", \"add SPARK_HOME env\" or \"start Zeppelin\" become obsolete.\r\n\r\nYou can now also see quite clearly which tests are actually simple unit tests and which should actually be executed as integration tests. A switch to integration tests can be made in a separate pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy IDE and locale are set to German. Java adopts this and also outputs some exceptions in German. I don't know how we deal with this, so I have removed language specific asserts.\r\n```\r\n      // depends on JVM language\r\n      // assertTrue(stacktrace.contains(\"No such file or directory\"), stacktrace);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n- Improvement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5999\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* CI\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? Yes\r\n* Does this needs documentation?
