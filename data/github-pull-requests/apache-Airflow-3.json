the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nrelated: #45739 \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41363 is a feature that heavily relied on pydantic models of AIP 44 to do some serialisation magic.\r\n\r\nHistorically did this: \r\n```\r\n            if self.use_airflow_context:\r\n                from airflow.serialization.serialized_objects import BaseSerialization\r\n\r\n                context = get_current_context()\r\n                with create_session() as session:\r\n                    # FIXME: DetachedInstanceError\r\n                    dag_run, task_instance = context[\"dag_run\"], context[\"task_instance\"]\r\n                    session.add_all([dag_run, task_instance])\r\n                    serializable_context: dict[Encoding, Any] = BaseSerialization.serialize(\r\n                        context, use_pydantic_models=True\r\n                    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n- So it used a pydantic model to serialize the DAG.\r\n- And the mapping looked like so:\r\n```\r\n_type_to_class: dict[DAT | str, list] = {\r\n    DAT.BASE_JOB: [JobPydantic, Job],\r\n    DAT.TASK_INSTANCE: [TaskInstancePydantic, TaskInstance],\r\n    DAT.DAG_RUN: [DagRunPydantic, DagRun],\r\n    DAT.DAG_MODEL: [DagModelPydantic, DagModel],\r\n    DAT.LOG_TEMPLATE: [LogTemplatePydantic, LogTemplate],\r\n    DAT.DATA_SET: [DatasetPydantic, Dataset],\r\n    DAT.TRIGGER: [TriggerPydantic, Trigger],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- And this:\r\n```\r\ndef serialize_operator(x: DAG) -> dict:\r\n    from airflow.serialization.serialized_objects import SerializedDAG\r\n\r\n    return SerializedDAG.serialize_dag(x)\r\n\r\n\r\ndef validate_operator(x: DAG | dict[str, Any], _info: ValidationInfo) -> Any:\r\n    from airflow.serialization.serialized_objects import SerializedDAG\r\n\r\n    if isinstance(x, DAG):\r\n        return x\r\n    return SerializedDAG.deserialize_dag(x)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince now we do not have the pydantic models of AIP 44 AND the fact that this didnt make it to any release, now is a time to chop it off.\r\n\r\ncc: @phi-friday \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

PR adds a `STRAIGHT_JOIN` hint to prevent an unintended full scan in `get_sorted_triggers`.\r\n\r\nWith MySQL backend, if there are many records in the `trigger`, it causes the `task_instance` to be

below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.models.trigger import Trigger\r\nfrom airflow.utils.session import NEW_SESSION, provide_session\r\n\r\n@provide_session\r\ndef

MongoClient apparently starts a separate thread that runs an active loop that performs sleep every 0.5 second.

#45426\r\n\r\nSome points of note about this PR:\r\n\r\n- Logging is changed in Celery, but only for Airflow 3\r\n\r\n  Celery does it's own \"capture stdout\" logging, which conflicts with the ones\r\n  we do in the TaskSDK, so we disable that; but to not change anything for\r\n  Airflow 3.\r\n\r\n- Simplify task SDK logging redirection\r\n\r\n  As part of this discovery that Celery captures stdout/stderr itself (and\r\n  before disabling that) I discovered a simpler way to re-open the\r\n  stdin/out/err so that the implementation needs fewer/no special casing.\r\n\r\n- Make JSON task logs more readable by giving them a consistent/useful order\r\n\r\n  We re-order (by re-creating) the event_dict so that timestamp, level, and\r\n  then even are always the first items in the dict\r\n\r\n- Makes the CeleryExecutor understand the concept of \"workloads\" instead a\r\n  command tuple.\r\n\r\n  This change isn't done in the best way, but until Kube executor is swapped\r\n  over (and possibly the other in-tree executors, such as ECS) we need to\r\n  support both styles concurrently.\r\n\r\n  The change should be done in such a way that the provider still works with\r\n  Airflow v2, if it's running on that version.\r\n\r\n- Upgrade Celery\r\n\r\n  This turned out to not be 100% necessary but it does fix some deprecation\r\n  warnings when running on Python 3.12\r\n\r\n- Ensure that the forked process in TaskSDK _never ever_ exits\r\n\r\n  Again, this isn't possible usually, but since the setup step of `_fork_main`\r\n  died, it didn't call `os._exit()`, and was caught further up, which meant\r\n  the process stayed alive as it never closed the sockets properly. We put and\r\n  extra safety try/except block in place to catch that\r\n\r\nI have not yet included a newsfragment for changing the executor interface as\r\nthe old style is _currently_ still supported.\r\n\r\n\r\nTesting: I ran `airflow scheduler`, `airflow fastapi-api`, and `airflow celery\r\nworker` and triggered some dags, viewed logs etc.\r\n\r\nAnd since a picture makes all PRs better\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1550\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-29 at 22 49 49\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6b1bc3c-917c-408e-bc7b-e4ac2890804e\" />  \r\n\r\n\r\nCelery window

the bundle refresh loop, we can call `get_current_version` a lot less often, as 1) we can skip it for bundles that do not support versioning and 2) for those that do, we already know the version from the last time we refreshed!\r\n\r\nSince this is a local call, this isn't a huge gain. But every little bit helps.\r\n\r\nTrying this again, 3rd times the charm, as #45999 was reverted in #46037, and #46100 was reverted in #46221 🙃

Instead, such events are recorded on the Event Log page as a \"heartbeat timeout\". In order to make troubleshooting such issues more intuitive to Airflow users, the terminology in the documentation should match that in the logs. \r\n\r\nI have added more emphasis to the heartbeat timeout terminology in the documentation so that Airflow users are able to easily find this documentation when they see \"heartbeat timeout\" events and relate the information in the documentation to what they see in the logs.\r\n\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

This is an addition to unit tests already checking OpenLineage for specific operators.\r\n\r\nThanks to VariableTransport introduced in #43643, we can easily check if OpenLineage events produced by any operator match the expected values. The logic is simple, for each system tests: adding the OpenLineageTestOperator to the DAG and providing it with json file with what we expect to be in the events.

That is because the log grooming process runs on a fixed, and for some use cases way too frequent schedule.

PR introduces some breaking changes to SMTP provider:\r\n\r\nThe argument ``from_email`` is now an optional kwarg in ``SmtpNotifier``, and the argument ``to`` became the first positional argument.\r\n\r\nConfiguring the ``SmtpNotifier`` and ``SmtpHook`` default values via Airflow SMTP configurations is not supported anymore. You can instead use the SMTP connection configuration to set the default values, where you can use:\r\n\r\n* the connection extra field ``ssl_context`` instead of the configuration ``smtp_provider.ssl_context`` or ``email.ssl_context`` in the SMTP hook.\r\n* the connection extra field ``from_email`` instead of the configuration ``smtp.smtp_mail_from`` in ``SmtpNotifier``.\r\n*

the views under the `security` tab in Airflow 2 are provided by FAB auth manager. These views are: list roles, list users, ... We do not want to re-build these pages in the new UI since, in the future, we want to get rid of FAB auth. The idea is to use these Flask generated views and embed them in the Flask application created in FAB provider. It will probably be confusing for the user because these views use the legacy UI but given we do not want to re-build these pages, this is the only solution we have. \r\n\r\nTechnically, these pages are already part of the Flask application, this PR just solves some bugs I found out when trying to access them.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

They are generally useful when you want to provide a per DAG Run level configuration for a dag run, lets say some dynamic information.\r\n\r\nThese work with legacy Airflow 2 and should be ported over to task sdk.\r\n- The dag params classes from models have been ported over to the task sdk under `definitions` along with changing tests, references, documentation (atleast most of it), and general refs.\r\n- The existing tests continue to run\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n#### Basic Testing\r\nDAG used for testing:\r\n```\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.decorators import task\r\nfrom
