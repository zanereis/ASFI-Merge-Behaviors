PR:\r\n- Adds `MatomoAnalyticsService` and uses it by default.\r\n- Configures it to submit data to https://analytics.apache.org/index.php?module=CoreHome&action=index&date=yesterday&period=day&idSite=19\r\n- Adds `AnalyticsService` as an abstract superclass for faster swaps in the future and to decrease coupling. The old `AnalyticsService` is renamed to `GoogleAnalyticsService` for possible future use.\r\n- Adds an action to track: `click_cancel_run` which had been left off before.\r\n- Fixes the bug of not tracking changing examples.\r\n- Fixes the bug of misreporting `open_link` event.\r\n\r\nFixes #21763 \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Merge this PR first, before merging https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/21891\r\n- add publishdate attribute to case studies md files (study category: lyft, seznam, ricardo, paloalto, hop). It was done since file layouts\\case-studies\\list.html uses hugo and ranges throug all case-studies using `ByPublishDate `attribute like this `{{ $pages := .Pages.ByPublishDate.Reverse }}`, but ByPublishDate wasn't located in any case studies md files, so when you add a new case study it takes a place not an order you would expect (freshly added file was shown second, not first or last). To take control over this flow abovementioned case studies md files got publishdate attribute and by that a new added file gets a correct place.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, the go-licenses script is failing because of an incompatibility between one of its modules and the system go version (1.16). This forces the script to run on Go 1.18. As part of that, a few changes needed to happen:\r\n\r\n1) `go install` instead of `go get` for binary install of go-licenses\r\n2) Introduction of a basic go.mod file to allow `go get` commands.\r\n3) Use v2 version of sdk to allow `go get` to correctly find it.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the Jira->GH migration, we should clean up our labels (discussion thread here - https://lists.apache.org/thread/cqj0n7qpck2g8f1wn41xqks37xqohcp3). For all new issues, this decomposes labels into their component parts (e.g. `'io-java-gcp'` => `'io', 'java', 'gcp'`), and unifies labels with common meaning into a single label (e.g. `'testing', 'tests'` => `tests`). It also removes some rarely used options for components.\r\n\r\nOnce this is in, I'll run a script to update all the existing labels to match this new format. Then we can delete the old now defunct labels\r\n\r\nPart of #21684\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

reverts commit 77833b19371a213ef11439b2925fa421af79b641.\r\n\r\nAs per #21690, this PR is a temporary fix to the window casting error (regression) introduced by #17112.  By reverting,  a potential data-correctness bug is being explicitly added back wherein responses from Elasticsearch could be output to a window which does not correspond to the input.\r\n\r\nMy assessment is that the data-correctness bug likely has a very low impact to pipeline authors.  It still needs to be addressed, but the potential data-correctness bug is the much lesser evil compared to the state of ElasticsearchIO in 2.39.0\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

seen a few more of \"`warning: Memory constraints are impeding performance; please increase max heap size.`\". This combines with `-Werror` to unfortunately fail the build. We haven't seen these in a while because we increased the heap a decent amount. But still our heaps are tiny by modern standards.\r\n\r\nThis PR adjusts the balance between memory and Gradle processes to give a bigger heap to fewer JVMs. We can see how it impacts performance of the builds.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#21652\r\n\r\nSome Batched DoFns (e.g. RunInference) will need to declare their input/output batch types dynamically based on some configuration. Technically a DoFn implementation should already be able to do this, but it's untested and undocumented. This PR simply documents the functions that need to be overridden (`get_input_batch_type`, `get_output_batch_type`), and adds tests verifying it's possible. \r\n\r\nWe also add new `_normalized` versions of these functions which are responsible for normalizing the typehints to Beam typehints. This allows users to return native typehints in their implementations if they prefer.\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master
