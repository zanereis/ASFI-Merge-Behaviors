working on adding Processing Time handling, it came to light that there were some inconsistent cases WRT handling TestStream based pipelines, in particular when there were no impulses included.\r\n\r\nThis fix uses the existing watermark hold system to restrain execution until the test stream is ready, and reflect holds based on test stream watermark events properly before their execution.\r\n\r\nThis discovered flaky fail behavior due to how timers and data outputs were handled in bundle processing, also fixed in this PR. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for

About\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses #29669 connecting Web UI cancel requests with the backend Job Management server.\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n\r\n- Fixes loading of CANCELED state for previously canceled Jobs\r\n- Triggers Web request from UI to backend on cancel clicks\r\n- Adds to /job/cancel http handler more detailed error reporting\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nIn addition to `go test ...`, manual testing of this PR was as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Run prism via `go run ./go/cmd/prism`\r\n2. Execute example via `go run ./go/examples/large_wordcount --output=/tmp/large_wordcount/out --runner=universal --endpoint=localhost:8073 --environment_type=LOOPBACK`\r\n3. Validate job display in web console at http://localhost:8074/job/job-001 with state `RUNNING`\r\n4. Click Cancel button\r\n5. Validate cancel-related log messages populate in console after [filtering for debug level logs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/log#level)\r\n6. Validate Cancel button disabled with Job state change from `RUNNING` to `CANCELLING`\r\n7. On reload of http://localhost:8074/job/job-001, validate state is `CANCELED`\r\n8. Navigating to http://localhost:8074 shows job-001 in Jobs list as `CANCELED`\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

minor updates to StreamingInsertsMetrics:\r\n  - Remove some AtomicIntegers from StreamingInsertsMetricsImpl. `SuccessfulRowsCount` and `FailedRowsCount` can be derived from the main thread executing the bundle. \r\n  - Cache Histogram metric as a `static final` in `StreamingInsertsMetricsImpl` instead of recreating it once per bundle. \r\n  - Record latency metrics one at a time instead of through a double stream, while the DoubleStream helps large bundles that result in multiple BigQuery RPCs, it hurts small bundles that only send a single RPC.

estimates the backlog (via `getSize`) for each partition using `partitionLowWatermark * partitionThroughtput`. The low watermark is held back by replication delay for replicated bigtable instances, which can cause the backlog to stay above the downscaling threshold even when the pipeline is 'caught up'\r\n\r\nThis adds a parameter to adjust the backlog downwards based on an estimate of the replication delay. We default it to 30 seconds which testing has shown works well for replicated instances. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

some scenarios, it is helpful to prebatch data before getting to RunInference. This enables the user to skip batching in these situations. For example, if you're doing image classification in a streaming pipeline, often your flow is:\r\n\r\n`Read from source (small data per element) -> download images (large data per element) -> inference`\r\n\r\nIdeally, you'd do cross-bundle batching, since in streaming pipelines bundles may be too small to get an advantage out of in-bundle batching. But this is much more expensive if you do it after downloading images since the shuffle is more expensive with larger data.\r\n\r\nToday, our recommendation is to either:\r\n\r\n1) `Read from source (small data per element) -> BatchElements -> download images (large data per element) -> RunInference (with max_batch_size=1)` - this requires overriding your `run_inference` function to immediately remove the batching dimension, like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrun_inference(<params>, batch: Sequence[Sequence[ExampleT]], <params>):\r\n   real_batch = batch[0]\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n2) `Read from source (small data per element) -> RunInference (with cross bundle batching)` - this requires overriding your `run_inference` function to download images, like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrun_inference(<params>, batch: Sequence[ExampleT], <params>):\r\n   real_batch = [download_and_preprocess_image(example) for example in batch] # Probably actually something async here\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth options are awkward and forces the user to modify their model handler/use a custom handler.\r\n\r\nWith this change, you could now simplify the flow to:\r\n\r\n`Read from source (small data per element) -> Cross-bundle batching -> download images (large data per element) -> RunInference without batching`\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

<code>[ipv6]</code> in compose files for <code>docker stack deploy</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/docker/cli/pull/4860\">docker/cli#4860</a></li>\n<li>rootless: Add support for enabling host loopback by setting the <code>DOCKERD_ROOTLESS_ROOTLESSKIT_DISABLE_HOST_LOOPBACK</code> environment variable to <code>false</code> (defaults to <code>true</code>). This lets containers connect to the host by using IP address <code>10.0.2.2</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47352\">moby/moby#47352</a></li>\n<li>containerd image store: <code>docker image ls</code> no longer creates duplicates entries for multi-platform images. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/45967\">moby/moby#45967</a></li>\n<li>containerd image store: Send Prometheus metrics. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47555\">moby/moby#47555</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug fixes and enhancements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>[CVE-2024-29018]: Do not forward requests to external DNS servers for a container that is only connected to an 'internal' network.

Doesn't work in Python 3.12: https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5470 , which affects #30828 .\r\n- might improve performance.  from https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/profiling_tutorial.html, calling a function in a profile run adds a certain overhead and disabling profiling for the often called functions is suggested. We can monitor Beam performance tests for changes: http://metrics.beam.apache.org/dashboards\r\n- To my knowledge low-level profiling has not been recently done and these changes can be re-enabled as needed.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
