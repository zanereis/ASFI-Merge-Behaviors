to this commit, any trivial let binding of `var1 = var2` is inlined.  However, buffer definitions are not updated, so this can result in dangling `tir::Var` instances.  This commit updates the `tir.Simplify` pass to keep trivial let bindings if they are used as part of a buffer definition.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the trivial `LetStmt` variable would be inlined into the buffer definition as well as other expressions.  However, because a buffer may be implicitly declared, the first usage may be within a constrained context.  If that happens, the simplified shape/strides expression cannot be used to update the buffer definition, as that simplification is not valid at all possible usage points of the buffer.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor i in range(n):\r\n    elem_offset = i\r\n    view = T.Buffer(1, data=buf, elem_offset = elem_offset)\r\n    if i == 0:\r\n        # First occurrence in TIR is here, where elem_offset would\r\n        # simplify to zero.\r\n        view[0] = 1\r\n    else:\r\n        # But the same buffer is used here, where elem_offset doesn't\r\n        # simplify to zero.\r\n        view[0] = 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will be resolvable after https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14778 lands, requiring all buffers to be declared with `DeclBuffer` prior to

https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14913 and https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14914 made analogous changes to `MakePackedAPI` and `MakeUnpackedAPI` to handle subroutine calls. Both PRs introduced the same symbol, `tvm::tir::SubroutineCallRewriter`, a local utility to update internal calls to a modified function.  While each PR passed CI individually, and was therefore able to merge, having both changes caused a duplicate symbol.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `MakePackedAPI` and `MakeUnpackedAPI` to place their local utilities into anonymous namespaces, avoiding the

this unit test generated a `Map<tvm::Target, IRModule>` whose default iteration order was not sorted by function name, built the `Map` of modules, then validated whether the resulting C code was a sorted list of 4 elements.  However, this condition was stricter than necessary, as it depended on the number of items added to the `Map` until it was unsorted.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the test to instead validate that

(e.g. M2 CPU + LLVM 16), the result is usually inaccurate. In this case, i.e. CPU feature detection fails, we will print a warning message and return an empty dict instead.\r\n\r\nTo properly detect CPU features on macbook, the commands below provided by the system are the most accurate:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsysctl -a machdep.cpu\r\nsysctl -a hw.optional\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn linux, usually it is recommended to directly query via:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncat /proc/cpuinfo\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-24T21:08:05Z","updated_at":"2023-05-25T06:38:28Z","closed_at":"2023-05-25T06:38:28Z","merged_at":"2023-05-25T06:38:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"1c39613811bb3470988c80a5a909a23ac0a3e2a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14946/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14946/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14946/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/1edaac44db050ca2f573b612371956dace06d21c","head":{"label":"junrushao:feature/2023-05-24/llvm-default-target-triple","ref":"feature/2023-05-24/llvm-default-target-triple","sha":"1edaac44db050ca2f573b612371956dace06d21c","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445038278,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoa-xg","name":"tvm","full_name":"junrushao/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao/tvm","description":"Open

while literal `True` and `False` values were converted to `tvm::Bool` instances, constant-foldable expressions (e.g. `0 == 1`) would be evaluated to `True`, but were then passed directly to the FFI.  Because the FFI uses the same representation for integer and boolean values, the conversion to `PrimExpr` resulted in a `tvm::Integer` instead of `tvm::Bool`.\r\n\r\nThis commit converts the argument of `T.Assert` to a `tvm::Bool` before calling the FFI, avoiding the ambiguity.  In addition, the `AssertStmt` constructor now validates the datatype of the condition, to prevent it from re-occurring.\r\n\r\nThis was first caught in the unit test `test_debug_info.py::test_llvm_ir_debug_info`, which failed validation on some versions of LLVM due to the use of `i32` as the condition of an assert.","created_at":"2023-05-24T20:05:22Z","updated_at":"2023-05-26T11:30:08Z","closed_at":"2023-05-26T05:01:01Z","merged_at":"2023-05-26T05:01:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"3a15eafd14b4f5dcf8539423a7a3f57b52421c33","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14941/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14941/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14941/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/edc95a773251eab5d5d0da8122ef980440dff820","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:tvmscript_assert_foldable_bool","ref":"tvmscript_assert_foldable_bool","sha":"edc95a773251eab5d5d0da8122ef980440dff820","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

`DefaultGPUSchedule` pass aims to provide a simplest schedule to generate a valid GPU kernel. Its logic is just to fuse all data parallel loops together and then to split them according to `max_thread_per_block` and `max_threadblocks`. However, currently this pass can not handle the scalar program well such as:\r\n```\r\n@I.ir_module\r\nclass Add:\r\n    @R.function\r\n    def main(x: R.Tensor((), \"int64\")) -> R.Tensor((), \"int64\"):\r\n        gv: R.Tensor((), \"int64\") = R.add(x, R.const(1, \"int64\"))\r\n        return gv\r\n```\r\nWhen we lower `Add`, it will create a prim func like:\r\n```\r\n@tvm.script.ir_module\r\nclass Before:\r\n    @T.prim_func\r\n    def add(rxplaceholder: T.Buffer((), \"int64\"), T_add: T.Buffer((), \"int64\")):\r\n        T.func_attr({\"tir.noalias\": T.bool(True)})\r\n        with T.block(\"T_add\"):\r\n            vi = T.axis.spatial(1, T.int64(0))\r\n            T.reads(rxplaceholder[()])\r\n            T.writes(T_add[()])\r\n            T_add[()] = rxplaceholder[()] + T.int64(1)\r\n```\r\nNote that `te/operation/create_primfunc.cc:L321` will create a dummy iter var for no loops case. So when running `DefaultGPUSchedule`, it will report `Check failed: loops.size() == iters.size() (1 vs. 0)`.\r\nThis PR fixes this case by adding a unit loop.","created_at":"2023-05-23T17:06:08Z","updated_at":"2023-05-23T20:06:22Z","closed_at":"2023-05-23T20:06:22Z","merged_at":"2023-05-23T20:06:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"afa53ded935a9cdee11995021b32c9c365277f6f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14928/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14928/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14928/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/4159167bb987c9ba10ac74f01f8735d97f17f3bc","head":{"label":"SiriusNEO:unity-dev/2023-05-24-fix-default-schedule","ref":"unity-dev/2023-05-24-fix-default-schedule","sha":"4159167bb987c9ba10ac74f01f8735d97f17f3bc","user":{"login":"SiriusNEO","id":41781658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzgxNjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41781658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO","html_url":"https://github.com/SiriusNEO","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":601263901,"node_id":"R_kgDOI9aPHQ","name":"tvm","full_name":"SiriusNEO/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"SiriusNEO","id":41781658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzgxNjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41781658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO","html_url":"https://github.com/SiriusNEO","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/SiriusNEO/tvm","description":"Open

PR refactors `SplitHostDevice` into three separate transformations.  Previously, `SplitHostDevice` would replace device regions with a `builtin::tvm_call_packed()` node to replace the extracted region.  After this PR, this process is performed in three separate steps.\r\n\r\n1. `AnnotateDeviceRegion`: Annotate the regions that should be executed on another target.\r\n2. `SplitHostDevice`: Extract the annotated region into an independent PrimFunc, with a `GlobalVar` to represent the call from into the new subroutine.\r\n3. `LowerDeviceKernelLaunch`: For any subroutine call where the caller and callee are on different devices, replace with a device kernel launch.","created_at":"2023-05-22T18:03:05Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T04:01:27Z","closed_at":"2023-05-26T20:22:13Z","merged_at":"2023-05-26T20:22:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"6eb077944295b96d70531db9b7048f2e87af1cfc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14918/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14918/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14918/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/7cba585ccb03f7225393f8917f8ef70812964cd4","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:split_host_device_handle_subroutines","ref":"split_host_device_handle_subroutines","sha":"7cba585ccb03f7225393f8917f8ef70812964cd4","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

the `MakePackedAPI` lowering pass treated all functions as externally-visible functions, which require the `\"global_symbol\"` attribute and are updated to use the `PackedFunc` API.  This commit updates `MakePackedAPI` to be aware of subroutines, distinguishing between externally-visible subroutines, which have the `\"global_symbol\"` attribute, and internal subroutines, which do not have the `\"global_symbol\"` attribute.\r\n\r\nExternally-visible subroutines may be called directly by the user of a `runtime.Module`, and must use the packed func interface.  Any internal callers of an externally-visible subroutine must be updated to use the `builtin::tvm_call_cpacked()`.\r\n\r\nInternal subroutines may not be called directly by an external user, and neither the subroutine's signature nor any internal callers should be updated to the packed func interface.","created_at":"2023-05-22T13:48:29Z","updated_at":"2023-05-25T12:37:23Z","closed_at":"2023-05-25T12:37:00Z","merged_at":"2023-05-25T12:37:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"41a616ffba73952318a90a851454dbb319324883","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14913/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14913/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14913/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/9859694db50440d714dc61fc284881082a8ac3f0","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:make_packed_api_handle_subroutines","ref":"make_packed_api_handle_subroutines","sha":"9859694db50440d714dc61fc284881082a8ac3f0","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

a `DeclBuffer` object in which `decl_buffer->buffer->data` had not been defined would be printed without the `data` argument. This was the same representation as the `Allocate`/`DeclBuffer` pattern (e.g. `buf = T.decl_buffer(shape,dtype)`), and so the `Allocate` node would be inserted when parsing.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the printing of buffers to be aware of which variables are implicitly declared in the process of declaring a buffer.  (e.g. A buffer that occurs in `BlockNode::alloc_buffers` defines both the buffer and the data pointer, while a `DeclBuffer` only defines the buffer.)  This is used to produce a different representation for the undefined data pointer, removing the ambiguity with the `Allocate`/`DeclBuffer` sugar.\r\n\r\nBecause this change only affects malformed TIR in which a `DeclBuffer` node references an undefined data pointer, it is intended primarily for debugging purposes.","created_at":"2023-05-21T03:22:43Z","updated_at":"2023-05-22T12:58:59Z","closed_at":"2023-05-22T03:15:51Z","merged_at":"2023-05-22T03:15:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"53cee4bca3743a2e26bcb1bfe7aa2aeb3956040d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14900/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14900/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14900/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/425be3291c3bfd2dd99016d5fde78da6cdc2da13","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:tvmscript_decl_buffer_undefined_data_ptr","ref":"tvmscript_decl_buffer_undefined_data_ptr","sha":"425be3291c3bfd2dd99016d5fde78da6cdc2da13","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

Motivation\r\nRecently NVIDIA announced official support of the fp8 data type: e4m3 and e5m2, the first one has 4 bits for exponent and 3 bits for mantissa while the second one has 5 bits for exponent and 2 bits for mantissa, and NVIDIA encourages using e4m3 for forward and e5m2 (larger dynamic range) for backward. Currently, TVM has no support for these data types, as the first step to support fp8, this PR adds new type codes for `e4m3_float8` and `e5m2_float8`, and implement legalization passes `FP8ComputeLegalize` and `FP8StorageLegalize` so that we can use them for backends that do not have native fp8 support.\r\n\r\n# Future Work\r\n- [ ] Emit CUDA fp8 primitives in CUDA codegen.\r\n- [ ] Support `wgmma.mma_async.sync` ptx assembly to use fp8 tensor cores in Ada/Hopper.\r\n- [ ] Support fp8 in dlpack.\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\nInfinity and NaN are not handled in our legalization pass (this behavior is the same as our previous BF16 legalization implementation) because it's costly to support them on the software side. It's the user's duty to guarantee that the conversion is safe.\r\n\r\n# Reference\r\n- [FP8 support discussion in TVM forum](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/tvm-support-for-fp8-a-discussion/14656)\r\n- [FP8 Formats for Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05433)\r\n\r\ncc @MasterJH5574 @masahi @tqchen @Hzfengsy

PR allows TIR PrimFuncs to call subroutines located within the same IRModule.  The immediate goal is to make it easier to hand-write TIR that represents output of possible optimizations, to determine whether those optimizations would be worth implementing.  A longer-term goal is to enable multi-device scheduling, such as tensor-parallel compute, in which a single TIR function may be scheduled to delegate portions of the compute onto multiple devices.\r\n\r\nThe use cases enabled by this PR are shown in the unit tests in `tests/python/unittest/test_tir_subroutine_call.py`, which is the best place to start for reviewing.  (And both thanks and apologies in advance to reviewers for the larger PR!)  The changes enabling these use cases are summarized below:\r\n\r\n* Cherry-pick TVMScript changes from unity branch, to parse `module.func_name` as a GlobalVar\r\n\r\n* Update TIR building to only use IRModule to IRModule transforms, without using the intermediate `Map<Target, IRModule>`.  This ensures that each pass can identify the callee within the same IRModule.  External functions that accept `Map<Target, IRModule>` as input are normalized before lowering.\r\n\r\n* Refactor `SplitHostDevice` to output PrimFunc-to-PrimFunc calls, with a subsequent `LowerDeviceKernelLaunch` pass to generate compute kernel launches, as well as handling any user-written host-to-device.\r\n\r\n* Update several passes to accept input PrimFuncs without a `kGlobalSymbol` attribute\r\n\r\n* Update LLVM codegen to handle `GlobalVar` as the `CallNode::op`, producing calls to the subroutine.","created_at":"2023-05-16T17:47:11Z","updated_at":"2023-08-08T21:31:17Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14862/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14862/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14862/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/3d6f97e1497d5821585e46d1096be82b0a99f445","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:tir_subroutine_pr","ref":"tir_subroutine_pr","sha":"3d6f97e1497d5821585e46d1096be82b0a99f445","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

my BYOC flow, I see that during various transformations, sometimes trivial no-ops like relay.transpose(x, axes=[0, 1, 2, 3]) are created. I would expect these to be optimized out with the SimplifyExpr pass which is not happening currently. This creates issues when I try to perform pattern matching on the graph.\r\n\r\nCurrently, SimplifyExpr looks for back to back transpose ops to optimize. This PR splits the current pass into two allowing us to optimize out these trivial ops as

only appears in the type annotation of the function being parsed. In this case, the python interpreter will evaluate the annotation first before invoking the decorator, and thus if `dtype` doesn't appear in the function body, it will not be considered as being captured by the function itself. As a result, `inspect` module will be unable to supply the value of `dtype` during parsing, leading to failure.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug by maintaining a copy of function annotations that are already parsed. Whenever expression evaluation fails during parsing, it falls back to using the copy that is evaluated by python interpreter.","created_at":"2023-05-14T00:01:32Z","updated_at":"2023-05-14T05:09:00Z","closed_at":"2023-05-14T05:08:59Z","merged_at":"2023-05-14T05:08:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"9f0c64227392b803e8ccc812ec1178c7f00ab6e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14849/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14849/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14849/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/e2bf54c33b3cfa5eccf131f0db0e2574615eb2d0","head":{"label":"junrushao:bugfix/2023-05-13/fix-uncaptured-ann","ref":"bugfix/2023-05-13/fix-uncaptured-ann","sha":"e2bf54c33b3cfa5eccf131f0db0e2574615eb2d0","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445038278,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoa-xg","name":"tvm","full_name":"junrushao/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao/tvm","description":"Open

started to use `scaled_dot_product_attention` as of v0.16 in SD VAE. See the doc https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention.html. We cannot support attention mask, dropout, and causal mask optimization for now. \r\n\r\nThe PT attention op requires a different input format than our attention op, so we need to transpose inputs. Luckily those transpose can be canceled in practice, since diffusers does transpose on q/k/v before calling `scaled_dot_product_attention` anyway (a design mistake?): https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/909742dbd6873052995dc6cd5f4150ff238015d2/src/diffusers/models/attention_processor.py#L906-L908\r\n\r\nI'm also doing clean up on FX test cases. We shouldn't need `@tvm.testing.requires_gpu` since the tests don't execute anything on GPU. I'll also try removing local `import torch` if possible (CI should have PT installed, right?)\r\n\r\n@MasterJH5574 @jinhongyii  @cyx-6

during the ConvertLayout pass, whenever there is a nn.batch_flatten op, additional layout transforms are inserted before the nn.batch_flatten op. This may not be efficient.\r\n\r\nIn addition, for BYOC targets (which expects ops to have a certain layout), insertion of these transforms can create additional overhead - especially if they cannot be handled by target which then creates additional compiler regions.\r\n\r\nThis can be avoided by propagating the updated layouts to the nn.batch_flatten
