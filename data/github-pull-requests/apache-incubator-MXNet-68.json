tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Use

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Fix wikitext2 sample

Description ##\r\nAdding a new docker input file (mkl) to be utilized for making CPU optimized docker file.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Added a new docker input file. (docker/Dockerfiles/Dockerfile.in.lib.mkl). Ran the command './tool.sh build python mkl'\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This is backward

Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nImportExport module based on this design doc - https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Proposal%3A+ImportExport+module.\r\nThis PR is a work in progress, we are just sending out this skeleton code to get views on the api specification, general code structure, and any additional dependencies it may pull into the project. As this module is also being discussed currently in the dev list, it is open to change in the design and specification of the project.\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Import from Onnx.\r\n- [ ] Export to Onnx.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- I have currently added this project under contrib, as it is used for experimental features which can later be moved elsewhere.\r\n\r\n@spidyDev @Roshrini @lupesko

This PR stores the unique row_ids in a row_sparse NDArray, whose data shape can be changed at run time when executed asynchronously. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Removed `use_copy` param in `BroadcastRowSparse ` - this is essentially the same as calling `Broadcast`\r\n- Removed `CopyRetainedRowsToGPU ` and always use `SparseRetain` because `CopyRetainedRowsToGPU` has high invocation overhead and `SparseRetain` has improved performance\r\n- Revised test cases to test against shapes/dtypes commonly used by users\r\n- Tested example/sparse/linear_classification with dist_sync kvstore\r\n- Tested tests/nightly/dist_sync_kvstore.py\r\n- Tested tests/python/gpu/test_kvstore.py\r\n- Tested tests/python/unittest/test_kvstore.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-26T07:20:59Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T23:33:28Z","closed_at":"2018-03-05T13:54:49Z","merged_at":"2018-03-05T13:54:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"02dd89a68f659c2a9b0bff62c54c50dff1151f6b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cjolivier01","id":11234557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01","html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":206159502,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDYxNTk1MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":707546925,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NDY5MjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9887/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9887/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9887/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/3ddfe47ccf4e31fd067025368fe7a3a0a7be74e5","head":{"label":"eric-haibin-lin:kvstore-pr","ref":"kvstore-pr","sha":"3ddfe47ccf4e31fd067025368fe7a3a0a7be74e5","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54802325,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDgwMjMyNQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-hai

Description ##\r\nRemove useless code in ndarray.h\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-26T02:11:22Z","updated_at":"2018-02-27T00:16:18Z","closed_at":"2018-02-26T18:13:56Z","merged_at":"2018-02-26T18:13:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"88f763eb44b71a35ecccca049df12fb4613ff27c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9886/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9886/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9886/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/eaf02a708d274f4209406bc15eb24e5c149e9f9e","head":{"label":"TaoLv:clean-code-fix","ref":"clean-code-fix","sha":"eaf02a708d274f4209406bc15eb24e5c149e9f9e","user":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113452572,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTM0NTI1NzI=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"TaoLv/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nAdds a function for loading the content of an NDArray file.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Added function MXNDArrayLoadFileContent\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- As far as I can determine it is not possible for the current API to be able to load the content of an NDArray file without knowing a lot of details about the file format, saving the dtypes, and using both the c_api.h and the c_predict_api.h. \r\n- The symbol loading API allows you to load from a file by name or by a string containing the JSON content so this would put it inline with that.\r\n- required for issue #9827\r\n- Not sure if you are happy with the names but that is the best I could come up with.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-25T11:35:43Z","updated_at":"2018-02-26T19:49:38Z","closed_at":"2018-02-26T19:48:12Z","merged_at":"2018-02-26T19:48:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"a352d1e2b31f7b479264ff3ba5fa2d9433f03013","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9883/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9883/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9883/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/355fa3b4dbc11071edd6bf676ce38281e2a4cff9","head":{"label":"dabraude:params_from_mem","ref":"params_from_mem","sha":"355fa3b4dbc11071edd6bf676ce38281e2a4cff9","user":{"login":"dabraude","id":3604692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3604692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude","html_url":"https://github.com/dabraude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119038900,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTkwMzg5MDA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"dabraude/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dabraude","id":3604692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3604692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude","html_url":"https://github.com/dabraude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dabraude/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n(reopen of #9846)\r\nAdd `force_deterministic` option for `contrib.SparseEmbedding`. The option guarantees deterministic gradient during backward pass. The backward performance of `force_deterministic=True` is 50% slower on p2 instance / 80% slower on p3 instance compared to `force_deterministic=False`. \r\n\r\n- The benchmark script is at the bottom\r\n- Changes in `indexing_op-inl.cuh` is simply a refactoring of the original code\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n# the benchmark script also requires other files under example/rnn/word_lm\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport mxnet as mx, math\r\nimport

wrap TVM compiled function as an NDArray function.

The hard part is that we need to use MXNet's engine to run the compiled function, instead of running them directly.\r\n\r\nSince TVM relies on LLVM, it is a bit too early to directly introduce this dependency. This PR does this differently. The TVM bridge depends on a header only component of TVM and does not have to link against tvm runtime.\r\n\r\nWhen a user has TVM installed in their environment, TVM queries the MXTVMBridge function to get the wrapper logic and use it to run MXNet's function asynchronously. When a user does not have TVM installed, the additional logic won't add any additional link dependencies.\r\n\r\nBecause of this optional linking logic, I did not include test case for MXNet's CI. But have verified that the code works locally on GPU and CPU case [here]( https://github.com/tqchen/tvm/blob/c1151420ac1376e2f4502564d8da5108089ae37d/tests/python/contrib/test_mxnet_bridge.py)\r\n\r\n## Restriction\r\nMXNet and TVM need to be built with same C++ ABI (because we pass around PackedFunc). This is somewhat a restriction but makes the code sharing easier by using the PackedFunc system. This usually can be achieved by using the same c++ compiler. For example, (g++4.8 and g++5.0 are not compatible, usually, the latest version of clang is compatible with latest version of g++), running incompatible ABI will cause undefined behavior in the code and possible segfault. This restriction can be possibly removed by forcing a pure C ABI, but requires additional work and may also affect the conciseness of code.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-25T05:19:13Z","updated_at":"2019-01-30T02:43:19Z","closed_at":"2018-02-27T16:41:29Z","merged_at":"2018-02-27T16:41:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"3545697210edebe02ef68bad7465c3054d34313d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9880/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9880/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9880/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/7d4524ab0ffe5e55f56cbded2eb2dea3880edc7b","head":{"label":"tqchen:master","ref":"master","sha":"7d4524ab0ffe5e55f56cbded2eb2dea3880edc7b","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42364986,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjM2NDk4Ng==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"tqchen/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/mxnet","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/m

Description ##\r\n\r\nI updated the build_all_versions.sh logic so that it works locally. It can repair the docs site when the version builds are broken. You can now build specific tags, and update them as a collection or one at a time. You can pick a specific tag to be the default. \r\n\r\nThere's a dockerfile that can be used with the CI build script and general script (build_site_tag) that can be called to generate any tags and update the site content.\r\n\r\nYou can now update AddVersion.py in master and have its changes override the site content, so it can patch any issues without being locked into code from a tag. Just run update_all_version.sh and it will regen the site with the fixes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented - should follow-up with another PR to better describe the docs build system, but at this point my view is still limited.\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n* I created a setup script (setup.sh) to handle all of the deps that were missing from the documentation - for an ubuntu setup.\r\n* I split out the docker setup to another script (setup_docker.sh) since the directions for this work, but they only help you create a local version of master and not the production style \"versioned\" site.\r\n* I split the logic in build_all_version.sh which is build and then update (injecting dom elements like the version dropdown) to be just build, and then created another script (update_all_version.sh) to handle the updates. This way you can build everything, then test how the injection stuff works. Otherwise, for every change you're forced to rebuild each version, which is crazy slow.\r\n    - The logic also had you check out from master and then use the scripts within master to do the updating. This makes it hard to test changes you want to make, so I moved this logic to using your current modified local version, and then update the temp build directories.\r\n    - The files mixed up the tag list naming convention, so I made sure it is always tag_list.txt and not tag.txt sometimes.\r\n    - I set `USE_OPENMP=1` - because the console output during build kept saying it would be better/faster with it on, so why is it off?\r\n\r\n## Usage ##\r\n\r\nUse an Ubuntu image. I'm using Deep Learning AMI v5.\r\n```\r\n./setup_docs_ubuntu.sh\r\n```\r\nOr use Docker as described below.\r\nThe scripts can be run stand-alone or in conjunction.\r\n\r\n### build_all_version.sh\r\nTakes one argument:\r\n* tag list - space delimited list of Github tags; Example: \"1.1.0 1.0.0 master\"\r\nExample Usage:\r\n`./build_all_version.sh \"1.1.0 1.0.0 0.12.1 0.12.0 0.11.0 master\"`\r\n\r\n### update_all_version.sh\r\nTakes three arguments:\r\n* tag list - space delimited list of Github tags; Example: \"1.1.0 1.0.0 master\"\r\n* default tag - which version should the site default to; Example: 1.0.0\r\n* root URL - for the versions dropdown to change to production or dev server; Example: http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/\r\n\r\nExample Usage:\r\n`./update_all_version.sh \"1.1.0 1.0.0 0.12.1 0.12.0 0.11.0 master\" 1.1.0 http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/`\r\n\r\n### build_site_tag.sh\r\nThis one is useful for Docker. When you run the image you can call this script as a command a pass the tags, default tag, and root url.\r\nTakes the same three arguments that update_all_version.sh takes.\r\nIt will execute build_all_version first, then execute update_all_version next.\r\n\r\nExample Usage:\r\n./build_site_tag.sh \"1.1.0 master\" 1.0.0 http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/\r\nThen run a web server on the outputted `VersionedWeb` folder.\r\n\r\n## Docker Usage ##\r\n\r\nThe dockerfile will build all of the docs when you create the docker image. You can also run the scripts listed above to regenerate any tag or collection of tags. \r\n\r\nBuild like:\r\nsudo docker build -t aaronmarkham:mxnet-docs-base .\r\n\r\nRun like:\r\nsudo docker run

Description ##\r\nWhen someone uses `even_split=False`, it means they want the data to be processed irrespective of how divisible the amount of data is. Suppose you have 8 GPUs. The old code would:\r\n- Error out if the last batch only had 7 samples\r\n- If you had 64+7 samples, one expects 7 GPUs w/ 9 and 1 GPU w/ 8; however, you got 7 GPUs w/ 8 and 1 GPU w/ 15.\r\n\r\nThis address both issues.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Support `size < num_slice` case\r\n- [x] Use `ndarray.split()` when divisible, not just when `even_split=True`\r\n- [x] More evenly distribute splits\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n**One may be concerned by returning less than `num_slice` lists when `even_split=False`.** However, this is not a problem idiomatically. E.g., if `num_slice = len(context)`, the expression `zip(context, split)` would truncate to the length of `split <= num_slice`; note that `split_and_load` works as-is after changing

Description ##\r\n\r\n`example/numpy-ops/ndarray_softmax.py` contains a custom softmax implementation using RTC. However, it extends `NDArrayOp` which is deprecated. Moreover the example seems not compatible with the current RTC API. I think that the example confuses newbies like me who didn't know the previous history of the API changes. So I think it is a good idea to remove the broken example and add a new RTC example based on `CustomOp`. The new example `example/numpy-ops/custom_softmax_rtc.py` is based on the existing example (`example/numpy-ops/custom_softmax.py`) but uses custom CUDA kernels through RTC. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- `example/numpy-ops/ndarray_softmax.py` is removed.\r\n- `example/numpy-ops/custom_softmax_rtc.py` is added.\r\n- `example/numpy-ops/README.md` is

Description ##\r\nThere is a race condition in data layout conversion in the MKLDNN implementation. \r\nCurrently, when NDArray::data() is called, it converts data format (from the MKLDNN format to the default format) inside an NDArray. In the threaded execution engine, while an NDArray is being converted in a thread, the array can also be read by another thread. In this case, the other thread can read wrong data. A similar race condition may also exist in the MKLML integration, which sometimes generates the garbage results.\r\n\r\nPlease see the details of the error in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/9820\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-22T21:36:15Z","updated_at":"2018-03-05T16:02:29Z","closed_at":"2018-03-01T10:54:35Z","merged_at":"2018-03-01T10:54:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"f9c2689ec2ffd61ce123dce5857f8a797f21e4df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9862/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9862/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9862/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/5625976502c015336e50d6fdf8006beb7a534893","head":{"label":"zheng-da:fix_mkldnn_bugs","ref":"fix_mkldnn_bugs","sha":"5625976502c015336e50d6fdf8006beb7a534893","user":{"login":"zheng-da","id":70481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da","html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":103710066,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDM3MTAwNjY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"zheng-da/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zheng-da","id":70481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da","html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best

complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [N/A] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Added option to CMake to build with NNPack support \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- NNPack and dependencies are located in subdirectory of 3rdparty\r\n- Some source files needed changes to reflect new location\r\n- This does make the website documentation on compiling NNPack obsolete \r\n\r\n@Maratyszcza may want to check that everything is correct with regards to imports\r\n\r\nNext up is refactoring the operators","created_at":"2018-02-22T08:17:04Z","updated_at":"2018-06-30T20:23:40Z","closed_at":"2018-06-30T20:23:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6199ff262bc6e375c694abfeb86b312b39f03583","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cjolivier01","id":11234557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01","html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yajiedesign","id":771744,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTc0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771744?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign","html_url":"https://github.com/yajiedesign","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9860/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9860/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9860/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/c17a98746d758ac753c7f55ca30641db35bc5b89","head":{"label":"dabraude:nnpack","ref":"nnpack","sha":"c17a98746d758ac753c7f55ca30641db35bc5b89","user":{"login":"dabraude","id":3604692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3604692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude","html_url":"https://github.com/dabraude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119038900,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTkwMzg5MDA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"dabraude/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dabraude","id":3604692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3604692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dabraude","html_url":"https://github.com/dab

correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and

Description ##\r\n\r\nMalformed if statement was excluding on all platforms\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

(i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThe original GPU sparse embedding operator uses atomic add which results non-deterministic gradient due to limited precision of fp32 and non-deterministic execution order. This PR replaces  atomic add with sort to guarantee determinism. \r\n\r\nTested with `example/rnn/word_lm/train.py`. Using `SparseEmbedding` and `Embedding` results the same loss with fixed seed. \r\n\r\nThe fixes makes the backward pass ~50% slower compared to the atomic_add implementation, measured by the script at the end. Further optimization can be done using `cub::Unique` instead of `cub::InclusiveSum` to generate lookup table. \r\n\r\n@ZiyueHuang @sxjscience \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n# the benchmark script also requires other files under example/rnn/word_lm\r\n\r\nimport

Description ##\r\nFix #9699. This should improve compatibility with other packages without introducing unexpected breakage.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nAccelerate the calculation of F1 by removing the for-loop. I find that using GPU will in fact make the code slower :sweat_smile:.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Accelerate F1\r\n\r\n\r\nResults of running the script

See comments for more details. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nI narrowed my example code down to this snip of code:\r\n```c++\r\n#include \"mxnet-cpp/MxNetCpp.h\"\r\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\r\n  Optimizer* opt = OptimizerRegistry::Find(\"sgd\");\r\n  opt = OptimizerRegistry::Find(\"adam\");\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTo produce this error:\r\n```c++\r\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'dmlc::Error'\r\n  what():  [18:02:48] /scratch/cahsin/repo/incubator-mxnet/cpp-package/include/mxnet-cpp/optimizer.hpp:141: Check failed: cmap().count(name) == 0 (1 vs. 0) sgd already registered\r\n\r\nStack trace returned 7 entries:\r\n[bt] (0) ./mlp_cpu(_ZN4dmlc10StackTraceEv+0x42) [0x411b41]\r\n[bt] (1) ./mlp_cpu(_ZN4dmlc15LogMessageFatalD1Ev+0x1b) [0x411db1]\r\n[bt] (2) ./mlp_cpu() [0x41538f]\r\n[bt] (3) ./mlp_cpu() [0x414de8]\r\n[bt] (4) ./mlp_cpu() [0x411231]\r\n[bt] (5) /lib64/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xfd) [0x3449c1ed1d]\r\n[bt] (6) ./mlp_cpu() [0x410ad9]\r\n\r\nAborted (core dumped)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am using adam there as an example, but any two calls to OptimizerRegistry::Find will result in the error. The problem is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/cpp-package/include/mxnet-cpp/optimizer.hpp#L127\r\n```c++\r\n    inline Optimizer* OptimizerRegistry::Find(const std::string& name) {\r\n      MXNETCPP_REGISTER_OPTIMIZER(sgd, SGDOptimizer);\r\n      MXNETCPP_REGISTER_OPTIMIZER(ccsgd, SGDOptimizer);  // For backward compatibility\r\n      MXNETCPP_REGISTER_OPTIMIZER(rmsprop, RMSPropOptimizer);\r\n      MXNETCPP_REGISTER_OPTIMIZER(adam, AdamOptimizer);\r\n      MXNETCPP_REGISTER_OPTIMIZER(adagrad, AdaGradOptimizer);\r\n      MXNETCPP_REGISTER_OPTIMIZER(adadelta, AdaDeltaOptimizer);\r\n      MXNETCPP_REGISTER_OPTIMIZER(signum, SignumOptimizer);\r\n      auto it = cmap().find(name);\r\n      if (it == cmap().end())\r\n        return nullptr;\r\n      return it->second();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/cpp-package/include/mxnet-cpp/optimizer.h#L133\r\n```c++\r\n    #define MXNETCPP_REGISTER_OPTIMIZER(Name, OptimizerType)\\\r\n      OptimizerRegistry::__REGISTER__(#Name, [](){return new OptimizerType();})\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/cpp-package/include/mxnet-cpp/optimizer.hpp#L141\r\n```c++\r\n    inline int OptimizerRegistry::__REGISTER__(const std::string& name, OptimizerCreator creator) {\r\n      CHECK_EQ(cmap().count(name), 0) << name << \" already registered\";\r\n      cmap().emplace(name, std::move(creator));\r\n      return 0;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means users can only call ```OptimizerRegistry::Find``` once because every time they want to create an optimizer object, ```OptimizerRegistry::Find``` re-registers everything. This is abnormal. If you look into what the Python API does [optimizer.py](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/optimizer.py#L113), you observe that ```def register(klass)``` isn't called by ```def create_optimizer(name, **kwargs)```. In fact, when the CPP-Package was first added in [Integrate cpp package (#5251)](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/21b2da07f6ff10669b7649860b913e17e6184708/cpp-package/include/mxnet-cpp/optimizer.hpp), the registering of optimizers was not placed into the creation:\r\n```c++\r\nstd::map<std::string, OptimizerCreator> OptimizerRegistry::cmap_;\r\n\r\nMXNETCPP_REGISTER_OPTIMIZER(sgd, SGDOptimizer);\r\nMXNETCPP_REGISTER_OPTIMIZER(ccsgd, SGDOptimizer);  // For backward compatibility\r\n\r\nOptimizer* OptimizerRegistry::Find(const std::string& name) {\r\n  auto it = cmap_.find(name);\r\n  if (it == cmap_.end())\r\n    return nullptr;\r\n  return it->second();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe embedding of register in Find happened with the merge of [[cpp-package] Fix multiple definition issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/5545/files#diff-715b8c623cdceb730bd1f01c9b243d62R67). Since there is a justification for the strange structure, I just put in a small fix that would register the optimizer just once.","created_at":"2018-02-16T15:50:19Z","updated_at":"2018-02-27T20:05:58Z","closed_at":"2018-02-27T20:05:57Z","merged_at":"2018-02-27T20:05:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"7a0509d6f5ee19b0d3530fb2a4cb944e4f743b33","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9809/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9809/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9809/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/7d00399c8620a517cc2a5cbd057a0c7e86a41ce7","head":{"label":"chsin:fix_opt","ref":"fix_opt","sha":"7d00399c8620a517cc2a5cbd057a0c7e86a41ce7","user":{"login":"chsin","id":5999234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTkyMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5999234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chsin","html_url":"https://github.com/chsin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chsin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chsin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chsin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chsin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chsin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chsin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chsin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chsin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chsin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c3e3a832bfeceff070ba263aa8a4489ca27f452e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nadapt instance-norm to an API similar to batch norm. fix doc\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] adapt instance-norm to an API similar to batch norm\r\n- [x] fix doc for reflection pad\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- instance norm op doesn't support axis yet, so swap_axis is used as a temporary solution.","created_at":"2018-02-16T11:55:52Z","updated_at":"2018-02-19T23:00:42Z","closed_at":"2018-02-19T19:47:15Z","merged_at":"2018-02-19T19:47:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"d04861575f18cd476132e56f4e738e9e6771338b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9807/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9807/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9807/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/2d411278bbed66ca9cf3137a5c92f0d9b6b528b8","head":{"label":"zhanghang1989:insnorm","ref":"insnorm","sha":"2d411278bbed66ca9cf3137a5c92f0d9b6b528b8","user":{"login":"zhanghang1989","id":8041160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDExNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8041160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989","html_url":"https://github.com/zhanghang1989","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":103984815,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDM5ODQ4MTU=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"zhanghang1989/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhanghang1989","id":8041160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDExNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8041160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989","html_url":"https://github.com/zhanghang1989","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhanghang1989/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nMxNET already implements the loss computation at Python layer (in python/mxnet/metric.py)\r\nFor most of the CNN models used for image-classification, as softmax is commonly used as the output, the cross-entropy or likelihood loss value is helpful to monitor the convergence trend during training.\r\nThe current implementation of example/image-classification/fit.py already provides an extensible implementation to report some useful information during training, such as accuracy. This PR utilizes this design and enabling the report of cross-entropy or nll loss value during training.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is: the cross-entropy loss and (negative) likelihood loss are most common used for softmax output, and therefore I choose reporting either cross-entropy or negative likelihood loss as long as the output layer is the softmax.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of this PR is add a string-type argument, that is the \"--loss\", and the corresponding type loss will be reported accordingly. _(if the user want to report more than one type of loss value, it can be a list, such as 'ce, nll'. )_\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nAll the code changes are in example/image-classification/common/fit.py\r\nA new argument '--loss' is introduced, and it can be set as either a string or a list corresponding to type(s) of the loss value accordingly.\r\nTaking the example/image-classification/train_cifar10.py as an example, the cross-entropy loss value will be reported if the below bold code line added,\r\nparser.set_defaults(\r\n    ......\r\n    **loss = 'ce'**\r\n    ......\r\n)\r\n\r\nThe output log will be the following pattern:\r\n\r\nINFO:root:Epoch[0] Batch [380] Speed: 504.42 samples/sec accuracy=0.087109 top_k_accuracy_5=0.469531 **cross-entropy=2.305971**\r\nINFO:root:Epoch[0] Train-accuracy=0.098437\r\nINFO:root:Epoch[0] Train-top_k_accuracy_5=0.506250\r\nINFO:root:Epoch[0] **Train-cross-entropy=2.304529**\r\nINFO:root:Epoch[0] Time cost=100.989\r\nINFO:root:Epoch[0]

backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-16T00:04:12Z","updated_at":"2018-02-26T18:09:46Z","closed_at":"2018-02-26T18:09:46Z","merged_at":"2018-02-26T18:09:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"4bcca8cc00986b23116cc7841d162ed2111ded83","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9801/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9801/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9801/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/5f427c6a6e667c6db11ac3eb3d9e8903d2af17b0","head":{"label":"cjolivier01:omp_fix","ref":"omp_fix","sha":"5f427c6a6e667c6db11ac3eb3d9e8903d2af17b0","user":{"login":"cjolivier01","id":11234557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01","html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86836111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjgzNjExMQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"cjolivier01/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cjolivier01","id":11234557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01","html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nMxNET already implements the loss computation at Python layer (in python/mxnet/metric.py) \r\nFor most of the CNN models used for image-classification, as softmax is commonly used as the output, the cross-entropy or likelihood loss value is helpful to monitor the convergence trend during training.\r\nThe current implementation of example/image-classification/fit.py already provides an extensible implementation to report some useful information during training, such as accuracy. \r\nMy submission utilizes this design and enabling the report of cross-entropy or nll loss value during training.\r\n \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nAll the code changes are in example/image-classification/common/fit.py\r\nA new argument '--loss' is introduced, and it can be set as 'ce' or 'nll-loss' corresponding to cross-entropy loss and negative likelihood loss respectively.\r\nTaking the train_cifar10.py as an example, the loss value will be reported if the below **bold code line** added,\r\nparser.set_defaults(\r\n    ......\r\n    **loss           = 'ce'**\r\n    ......\r\n)\r\n\r\nThe output log will be the following pattern:\r\n\r\nINFO:root:Epoch[0] Batch [380]  Speed: 504.42 samples/sec       accuracy=0.087109       top_k_accuracy_5=0.469531       **cross-entropy=2.305971**\r\nINFO:root:Epoch[0] Train-accuracy=0.098437\r\nINFO:root:Epoch[0]

Description ##\r\nThis is a rebasing and partial squashing of the stale \"ci test randomness2\" PR #8526 .  It's based on the premise that the CI should test the framework the way the users do- with lots of different data.  Having tests run with random data has been problematic though, with flaky tests being a constant annoyance.  This PR supplies the tools to track down the flakiness by explicitly seeding all tests that use random data, and reporting those seeds if the test fails.  The first commit of the PR rolls out the with_seed() decorator to tests under the tests/python/unittests directory with some hard-coded seeds designed to expose existing flakiness.  Follow-up commits will supply known fixes.  Further commits will touch the tests/python/gpu directory tests.\r\n\r\nFrom PR #8526:\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new simple level of control over unittest random seeds while providing inter-test random number generator (RNG) isolation. This PR is an improved replacement to the pending PR #8313. The improvements over that PR are:\r\n\r\n- A unittest that fails via an exception will have its seed reported in the test log. Reproducing the failure with the same-seeded data is simple and immediate.\r\n- The mx.random and python random seeds are also set (identically to np.random) giving deterministic behavior and test isolation for mxnet cpu and gpu RNG's.\r\n- A unittest failure via a core-dump can also be reproduced after the module test is re-run with debugging enabled.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTo provide this functionality, a custom decorator \"@with_seed()\" was created. This was considered more powerful than the nosetests \"@with_setup()\" facility, and less disruptive than changing all tests to become methods of a nosetests test class. The proposed new approach is demonstrated on a simple \"test_module.py\" test file of three tests. Assuming that the second test needs a set seed for robustness, the file might currently appear as:\r\n```\r\ndef test_op1():\r\n    <op1 test>\r\n\r\ndef test_op2():\r\n    np.random.seed(1234)\r\n    <op2 test>\r\n\r\ndef test_op3():\r\n    <op3 test>\r\n```\r\nEven though test_op3() is OK with nondeterministic data, it will have only a single dataset because it is run after test_op2, which sets the seed. Also, if test_op1() were to fail, there would be no way to reproduce the failure, except for running the test individually to produce a new and hopefully similar failure.\r\n\r\nWith the proposed approach, the test file becomes:\r\n```\r\nfrom common import setup_module, with_seed\r\n\r\n@with_seed()\r\ndef test_op1():\r\n    <op1 test>\r\n\r\n@with_seed(1234)\r\ndef test_op2():\r\n    <op2 test>\r\n\r\n@with_seed()\r\ndef test_op3():\r\n    <op3 test>\r\n```\r\nBy importing unittests/common.py, the seeds of the numpy and mxnet RNGs are set initially to a random \"module seed\" that is output to the log file. The initial RNGs can be thought of as module-level RNGs that are isolated from the individual tests and that provide the string of \"test seeds\" that determine the behavior of each test's RNGs. The \"@with_seed()\" test function decorator requests a test seed from the module RNG, sets the numpy, python and mxnet seeds appropriately and runs the test. Should the test fail, the seed for that test is output to the log file. Pass or fail, the decorator reinstates the module RNG state before the next test's decorator is executed, effectively isolating the tests. Debugging a failing test_op3 in the example would proceed as follows:\r\n```\r\n$ nosetests --verbose -s test_module.py\r\n[INFO] Setting module np/mx random seeds, use MXNET_MODULE_SEED=3444154063 to reproduce.\r\ntest_module.test_op1 ... ok\r\ntest_module.test_op2 ... [INFO] Setting test np/mx/python random seeds, use MXNET_TEST_SEED=1234 to reproduce.\r\nok\r\ntest_module.test_op3 ... [INFO] Setting test np/mx/python random seeds, use MXNET_TEST_SEED=2096230603 to reproduce.\r\nFAIL\r\n======================================================================\r\nFAIL: test_module.test_op3\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n<stack trace appears here>\r\n-------------------- >> begin captured logging << --------------------\r\ncommon: INFO: Setting test np/mx/python random seeds, use MXNET_TEST_SEED=2096230603 to reproduce.\r\n--------------------- >> end captured logging << ---------------------\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRan 3 tests in 1.354s\r\nFAILED (failures=1)\r\n```\r\nBecause test_op3 failed, its seed appeared in the log file. Also, the test_op2 seed was displayed as a reminder that that test needs more work before it is robust enough for random data. The command to reproduce the problem is produced simply by cutting and pasting from the log:\r\n```\r\n$ MXNET_TEST_SEED=2096230603 nostests --verbose -s test_module.py:test_op3\r\n```\r\nIf test_op3 instead dumped core, the test seed would not be initially apparent. Assuming the core-dump is repeatable based on the data, the module would first be re-run with the command:\r\n```\r\n$ MXNET_MODULE_SEED=3444154063 nostests --logging-level=DEBUG --verbose -s test_module.py\r\n```\r\nThe log would now include the test seeds for all tests before they are run, so the test could then be run in isolation as before with MXNET_TEST_SEED=2096230603.\r\n\r\nLet's assume that test_op3 was altered by increasing a tolerance. How robust is the test now? This can be explored by repeating the test many times as in:\r\n```\r\n$ MXNET_TEST_COUNT=10000 nostests --logging-level=DEBUG --verbose -s test_module.py:test_op3\r\n```\r\nFinally, this PR adds the @with_seed() decorator for all tests in modules that use random numbers. Also, it includes many specific test robustness fixes that were exposed once this new methodology was adopted internally by the author.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n-

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds a mixin class that F1 and other metrics like precision and recall can leverage in the future. It also provides a new option for the F1 metric called `average` which defines how the metric will be aggregated across mini batches. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\n\r\nThe \"micro\" vs \"macro\" update strategy is not specific to F1 score. The macro update just takes an average of averages, which can be done for any metric. It may be best to design an abstraction where any metric can have the micro/macro update option, but I couldn't see a good way to do that here that would:\r\n\r\n* be easy to use for end users AND\r\n* maintain backward compatibility AND\r\n* maintain current semantics\r\n\r\nFor now, the behavior for each type of update is hard coded into the `update` method of the `F1` class. We can discuss the approach.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I have missed or overlooked anything

Description ##\r\nFor multiple inputs or multiple labels in NDArrayIter, they are assigned IndexedSeq[NDArray] type, which is not flexible to design neural network like Python API because the naming rule here is dataname_0, dataname_1, etc. In more complex network you may want to give a meaningful names like \"user\" and \"item\" in Matrix Factorization example.\r\n\r\nWe modify the constructor to receive IndexedSeq[(String, NDArray)] type to allow assigning custom names. We can initialize the NDArrayIter like this:\r\n```scala\r\nval trainData1 = IndexedSeq((\"user\", NDArray.array(Array(1,2,3,4,5,6,3,2,7,1,6,9), shape = Shape(6,2))))\r\nval trainData2 = IndexedSeq((\"item\", NDArray.array(Array(1,2,3,4,5,6,3,2,6,1,6,9), shape = Shape(6,2))))\r\nval trainLabel = IndexedSeq((\"label\", NDArray.array(Array(5,11,17,7,9,24), shape = Shape(6))))\r\nval trainIter = new NDArrayIter(\r\n  trainData1 ++ trainData2,\r\n  trainLabel, \r\n  1, \r\n  false,\r\n  \"pad\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to compatible with the old argument version, we overload the

Description ##\r\nUnix Makefiles don't support toolsets, only Visual Studio and Xcode.\r\nThis fixes build for newer CMake versions on other platforms.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nAdd log-uniform distribution sampler similar to \r\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/log_uniform_candidate_sampler \r\nNote that tf implementation supports sampling w/o replacement, which is not available in this PR. \r\n@sxjscience \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nAddress the issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/9536\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-07T23:46:11Z","updated_at":"2018-02-18T23:30:04Z","closed_at":"2018-02-17T20:25:03Z","merged_at":"2018-02-17T20:25:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"44ead245cb56401f298b9983afe6f03ebc84b58d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cjolivier01","id":11234557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01","html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9738/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9738/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9738/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/13b65115b5b0f62ff502a3298d65ca0db9051134","head":{"label":"zhanghang1989:int64","ref":"int64","sha":"13b65115b5b0f62ff502a3298d65ca0db9051134","user":{"login":"zhanghang1989","id":8041160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDExNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8041160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989","html_url":"https://github.com/zhanghang1989","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":103984815,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDM5ODQ4MTU=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"zhanghang1989/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhanghang1989","id":8041160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDExNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8041160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989","html_url":"https://github.com/zhanghang1989","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghang1989/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhanghang1989/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n\r\nRemove Haibin's unused gmail key and added my apache.org key in its place\r\n@eric-haibin-lin \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-07T21:28:29Z","updated_at":"2018-02-07T22:34:40Z","closed_at":"2018-02-07T22:34:40Z","merged_at":"2018-02-07T22:34:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"a51cdb1bdeec521618d491f136621f7382588416","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9736/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9736/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9736/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/113e96407c1c5e36d575fbbcfacb280c43bae493","head":{"label":"cjolivier01:addmykey","ref":"addmykey","sha":"113e96407c1c5e36d575fbbcfacb280c43bae493","user":{"login":"cjolivier01","id":11234557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01","html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86836111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjgzNjExMQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"cjolivier01/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cjolivier01","id":11234557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01","html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,
