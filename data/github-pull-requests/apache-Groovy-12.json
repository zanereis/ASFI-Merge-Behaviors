[GROOVY-9282](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-9282) for the Jira issue.\r\n\r\nWhen overriding a method as `protected` with a super method being package-private (no modifier in Java or `@PackageScope` in Groovy), compilation fails with an error similar to this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nexampleMethod(java.lang.Object -> java.lang.Object) in com.example.Child cannot override exampleMethod in com.example.Base; attempting to assign weaker access privileges; was package-private\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis edge case seems to be missed at [GROOVY-8651](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-8651).\r\n\r\nGroovy 2.5.7 and 2.5.8 are affected. I didn't check Groovy 3.x.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Tobias Gesellchen

3.0.0 beta 1 has broken code that earlier worked in Alpha 4:\r\nSay you have a Java class with a setTitle(String) method. Now you override this class with a Groovy class. In it you declare the following member variable:\r\n\r\nJLabel title = new JLabel(\"skin\");\r\n\r\nThis breaks the Groovy compiler in v3.0.0 beta 1 (but not alpha 4) with the following error:\r\nThe return type of javax.swing.JLabel getTitle() in Script34$1$12 is incompatible with java.lang.String in se.datadosen.component.ControlPanel\r\n. At [-1:-1]  @ line -1, column -1.\r\n\r\nTwo things are noteworthy here:\r\n1) The line number references (-1) are broken\r\n2) Instead of letting the declared \"title\" variable hide the ability to call setTitle on the base class using the syntactic sugar of Groovy (foo = being syntactic sugar for setFoo(...)), it now bails out with this error, breaking Java compatibility. I expected this declaration to be allowed and simply hide the ability to call setTitle on the base class via that syntactic
