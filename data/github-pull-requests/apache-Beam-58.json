now, our stalebot doesn't process all issues/pull requests. This is because by default, [the stale action has a limit of 30 operations per run to avoid rate limiting](https://github.com/actions/stale#operations-per-run). Since reading a batch of 100 issues/PRs is considered a single operation, we aren't able to fully make it through the backlog of issues/PRs (which is >4000). This applies even though we are only acting on PRs because GitHub can't effectively tell the difference between the 2.\r\n\r\nUpping our limit to 100 will ensure that all pull requests will be processed. Since we only run this once per hour, this shouldn't really impact our rate limit of [1,000 operations per hour for the whole repo's GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#rate-limits-for-requests-from-github-actions). We're not utilizing a significant portion of this elsewhere.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution! Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Mention the appropriate issue in your description (for example: `addresses #123`), if applicable. This will automatically add a link to the pull request in the issue. If you would like the issue to automatically close on merging the pull request, comment `fixes #<ISSUE NUMBER>` instead.\r\n - [ ] Update `CHANGES.md` with noteworthy changes.\r\n - [ ] If this

#26166 \r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/24015, the map that stores BigtableService is transient. During serialized and deserialized, it recreates an empty map which ended up creating a new BigtableService per each thread. The fix makes the map static. \r\n\r\nIn the previous version, mutateRows operation has a timeout of 6 minutes. And after the migration, the default timeout became 1 minute, which makes the job fail more easily. Update the timeout back to 6 minutes. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#26186 and adds a `fileio.MatchContinuously` transform to the Go SDK.\r\n\r\nI have tested the transform manually on Dataflow and Flink, which seem to be the only runners that currently support all of watermark estimation, self-checkpointing and state provisioning, that this transform relies on. I have not added any unit tests for the same reason, and there were limitations with running integration tests with some of these features for Dataflow and Flink so I have skipped that as well.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a spontaneous issue with container creation that occurs with the current docker version. COPY requires *all* source directories to produce values for copying, not simply checking the results. \r\n\r\nTouching a file ensures COPY is satisfied, and this reduces the complexity WRT the Docker files. They no longer need to copy a vestigial license file to the destination, and then delete it. Except for the experimental typescript container, the Dockerfiles all delete all third_party licenses directories when the pulls are false anyway.\r\n\r\nFixes #26180\r\n\r\nAlso replaces the deprecated `MAINTAINER` Dockerfile command with `LABEL Author`, which is all the MAINTAINER command does.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, we don't require a value for the mps tag. This means that the default behavior (if a user doesn't know what they're doing) is to not actually share the object across processes; instead each process will create an object for that process.\r\n\r\nOne downside of this is that this change does make it harder to have a single process that proxies all requests to a separate process (which is the current behavior if you specify no tag and `alwaysProxy=true`). If a user really wants that use case, they can do something like `abc=MultiProcessShared(<constructor>, tag=uuid.uuid().hex, alwaysProxy=true)` to get the same behavior. I think that will be a much rarer use case though.\r\n\r\nThis change is intentionally breaking because if anyone is currently using this feature they're probably actually intending to share the object. Plus this whole thing was sorta busted in the mainline case anyways (see https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/26172)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, multi_process_shared doesn't set an auth key. When that happens, the manager still creates an auth key for that process based on the current process's authKey - https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/4dc339b4d69195448207e1faecc3e258700daf33/Lib/multiprocessing/managers.py#L503\r\n\r\nThis causes cross-process authentication to fail and means that multi_process_shared.py doesn't correctly work.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by using a constant auth key for all managers/requesters/processes.\r\n\r\nI was able to get an example running on Dataflow using this approach. https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/26178 also causes unit tests to fail which will be fixed by this change, so I'm deferring tests to that PR\r\n\r\nFixes #26167\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

[org.ajoberstar.grgit:grgit-gradle](https://github.com/ajoberstar/grgit) from 4.1.1 to 5.0.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/ajoberstar/grgit/releases\">org.ajoberstar.grgit:grgit-gradle's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>5.0.0</h2>\n<p>This release includes a number of breaking changes, with the main user highlight being the long awaited configuration cache support.</p>\n<p><strong>Known Issue:</strong> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/ajoberstar/grgit/issues/356\">#356</a> highlighted that (some?) multi-project builds will encounter an error when applying <code>org.ajoberstar.grgit</code> or <code>org.ajoberstar.grgit.service</code> to multiple projects. This is caused by an upstream Gradle issue <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/17559\">gradle/gradle#17559</a> that is, as of 2/10/2022, is targeted to be fixed in 7.5. I suggest multi-project builds hold off on upgrading until that upstream issue is resolved.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrade to JGit 6</li>\n<li>Drops support for Java 8 (due to JGit upgrade)</li>\n<li>Drops support for Gradle 4, 5, and 6</li>\n<li>Drops support for Groovy 2</li>\n<li><code>org.ajoberstar.grgit</code> is no longer auto-applied to all subprojects, you must apply it to any project that wants to access the <code>grgit</code> property</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/ajoberstar/grgit/issues/322\">#322</a> <code>--configuration-cache</code> is now supported (thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/abelom\"><code>@​abelom</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/runningcode\"><code>@​runningcode</code></a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/ajoberstar/grgit/issues/354\">#354</a> A new <code>org.ajoberstar.grgit-service</code> plugin is available to provide lazy access to a <code>GrgitService</code> (a Gradle <a href=\"https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_services.html\">BuildService</a>).

https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/19967\r\n\r\nThis change contains refactors which simplify adding support for enhanced fan-out (https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/23540).\r\n\r\nChanges include breaking serialisation compatibility of `KinesisSource` due to dropped `CheckpointGenerator` classes, e.g. Flink will not be able to restore Beam 2.46.0 savepoints. Runners which (de-)serialize only `KinesisReaderCheckpoint`, will be able to restore their state for KinesisIO. This is done such that affected classes - especially `KinesisIO.Read` - allow further non-breaking evolution.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

performance issue of S3 filesystem when reading large files (fixes #25991)\r\n\r\nDraining the S3 input stream is a bad idea as we might not read the entire file. Particularly for large files that get split (and [processed in parallel) this quickly explodes the amount of data that needs to be transferred.\r\n\r\nAs long as the remaining unread data fits into the TCP buffer this will continue draining the stream.\r\nThis is beneficial as the HTTP connection can be reused.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the stream / connection is aborted, which involves some significant overhead.\r\n\r\nThis must be done when closing, but also when moving the channel to a new position.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
