What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `InMemoryFileIndex`, we should filter out dir based on PathFilter before listing them. This is useful in the following case: Consider we have the following data:\r\n```\r\nhdfs://name:port/root-dir/timestamp=2019-01-01/***\r\nhdfs://name:port/root-dir/timestamp=2019-01-02/***\r\n....\r\nhdfs://name:port/root-dir/timestamp=2019-03-04/***\r\n```\r\nWe can set a PathFilter when the only part of directories' data is needed. Before this patch, we may need to trigger a Spark job or many local threads to listing all the directories. After patch, we can filter out the directories before listing them.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new UT tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-28T09:45:31Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T13:40:54Z","closed_at":"2019-12-31T13:40:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"201510edf4865f48bf28a5042f0e92217ef698dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24237/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24237/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24237/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/547641a83bacc2c43794bac10fa357518ff583fe","head":{"label":"ConeyLiu:fliter-directory","ref":"fliter-directory","sha":"547641a83bacc2c43794bac10fa357518ff583fe","user":{"login":"ConeyLiu","id":12733256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzMzMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12733256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/ConeyLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54686577,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDY4NjU3Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ConeyLiu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ConeyLiu","id":12733256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzMzMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12733256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/ConeyLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ConeyLiu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn data source v1, save mode specified in `DataFrameWriter` is passed to data source implementation directly, and each data source can define its own behavior about save mode. This is confusing and we want to get rid of save mode in data source v2.\r\n\r\nFor data source v2, we expect data source to implement the `TableCatalog` API, and end-users use SQL(or the new write API described in [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gYm5Ji2Mge3QBdOliFV5gSPTKlX4q1DCBXIkiyMv62A/edit?ts=5ace0718#heading=h.e9v1af12g5zo)) to acess data sources. The SQL API has very clear semantic and we don't need save mode at all.\r\n\r\nHowever, for simple data sources that do not have table management (like a JIRA data source, a noop sink, etc.), it's not ideal to ask them to implement the `TableCatalog` API, and throw exception here and there.\r\n\r\n`TableProvider` API is created for simple data sources. It can only get tables, without any other table management methods. This means, it can only deal with existing tables.\r\n\r\n`TableProvider` fits well with `DataStreamReader` and `DataStreamWriter`, as they can only read/write existing tables. However, `TableProvider` doesn't fit `DataFrameWriter` well, as the save mode requires more than just get table. More specifically, `ErrorIfExists` mode needs to check if table exists, and create table. `Ignore` mode needs to check if table exists. When end-users specify `ErrorIfExists` or `Ignore` mode and write data to `TableProvider` via `DataFrameWriter`, Spark fails the query and asks users to use `Append` or `Overwrite` mode.\r\n\r\nThe file source is in the middle of `TableProvider` and `TableCatalog`: it's simple but it can check table(path) exists and create table(path). That said, file source supports all the save modes.\r\n\r\nCurrently file source implements `TableProvider`, and it's not working because `TableProvider` doesn't support `ErrorIfExists` and `Ignore` modes. Ideally we should create a new API for path-based data sources, but to unblock the work of file source v2 migration, this PR proposes to special-case file source v2 in `DataFrameWriter`, to make it work.\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes `SaveMode` from data source v2, as now only the internal file source v2 needs it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere is currently no existing Scala API equivalent for the higher order functions introduced in Spark 2.4.0.\r\n * transform\r\n * aggregate\r\n * filter\r\n * exists\r\n * forall\r\n * zip_with\r\n * map_zip_with\r\n * map_filter\r\n * transform_values\r\n * transform_keys\r\n\r\nEquivalent column based functions should be added to the Scala API for org.apache.spark.sql.functions with the following signatures:\r\n\r\n \r\n```scala\r\ndef transform(column: Column, f: Column => Column): Column = ???\r\n\r\ndef transform(column: Column, f: (Column, Column) => Column): Column = ???\r\n\r\ndef exists(column: Column, f: Column => Column): Column = ???\r\n\r\ndef filter(column: Column, f: Column => Column): Column = ???\r\n\r\ndef aggregate(\r\nexpr: Column,\r\nzero: Column,\r\nmerge: (Column, Column) => Column,\r\nfinish: Column => Column): Column = ???\r\n\r\ndef aggregate(\r\nexpr: Column,\r\nzero: Column,\r\nmerge: (Column, Column) => Column): Column = ???\r\n\r\ndef zip_with(\r\nleft: Column,\r\nright: Column,\r\nf: (Column, Column) => Column): Column = ???\r\n\r\ndef transform_keys(expr: Column, f: (Column, Column) => Column): Column = ???\r\n\r\ndef transform_values(expr: Column, f: (Column, Column) => Column): Column = ???\r\n\r\ndef map_filter(expr: Column, f: (Column, Column) => Column): Column = ???\r\n\r\ndef map_zip_with(left: Column, right: Column, f: (Column, Column, Column) => Column): Column = ???\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI've mimicked the existing tests for the higher order functions in `org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameFunctionsSuite` that use `expr` to test the higher order functions.\r\n\r\nAs an example of an existing test: \r\n```scala\r\n  test(\"map_zip_with function - map of primitive types\") {\r\n    val df = Seq(\r\n      (Map(8 -> 6L, 3 -> 5L, 6 -> 2L), Map[Integer, Integer]((6, 4), (8, 2), (3, 2))),\r\n      (Map(10 -> 6L, 8 -> 3L), Map[Integer, Integer]((8, 4), (4, null))),\r\n      (Map.empty[Int, Long], Map[Integer, Integer]((5, 1))),\r\n      (Map(5 -> 1L), null)\r\n    ).toDF(\"m1\", \"m2\")\r\n\r\n    checkAnswer(df.selectExpr(\"map_zip_with(m1, m2, (k, v1, v2) -> k == v1 + v2)\"),\r\n      Seq(\r\n        Row(Map(8 -> true, 3 -> false, 6 -> true)),\r\n        Row(Map(10 -> null, 8 -> false, 4 -> null)),\r\n        Row(Map(5 -> null)),\r\n        Row(null)))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've added this test that performs the same logic, but with the new column based API I've added.\r\n```scala\r\n    checkAnswer(df.select(map_zip_with(df(\"m1\"), df(\"m2\"), (k, v1, v2) => k === v1 + v2)),\r\n      Seq(\r\n        Row(Map(8 -> true, 3 -> false, 6 -> true)),\r\n        Row(Map(10 -> null, 8 -> false, 4 -> null)),\r\n        Row(Map(5 -> null)),\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI was playing with the scheduler and found this weird thing. In `TaskSchedulerImpl` we import `scala.collection.Set` without any reason. This is bad in practice, as it silently changes the actual class when we simply type `Set`, which by default should point to the immutable set.\r\n\r\nThis change only affects one method: `getExecutorsAliveOnHost`. I checked all the caller side and none of them need a general `Set` type.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A","created_at":"2019-03-27T21:51:51Z","updated_at":"2019-03-28T12:14:58Z","closed_at":"2019-03-28T12:14:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"07f07713519512a6c7f9ea3f32c8bebf184f9fa9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24231/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24231/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24231/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d8d431feb81fd8d02ae0c76f0d24624e63e733fd","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:minor","ref":"minor","sha":"d8d431feb81fd8d02ae0c76f0d24624e63e733fd","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-26982 allows users to describe output of a query. However, it had a limitation of not supporting CTEs due to limitation of the grammar having a single rule to parse both select and inserts. After SPARK-27209, which splits select and insert parsing to two different rules, we can now support describing output of the CTEs easily.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests were modified.","created_at":"2019-03-26T15:44:58Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T23:07:02Z","closed_at":"2019-03-26T23:03:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ba212f6b7889ae28bb90ca4e2319645eaf7fd7ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24224/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24224/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24224/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a92bec60ab8e0fe4c88e89c53d49aa8dbef5baca","head":{"label":"dilipbiswal:describe_support_cte","ref":"describe_support_cte","sha":"a92bec60ab8e0fe4c88e89c53d49aa8dbef5baca","user":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42921897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkyMTg5Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"dilipbiswal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf we refresh a cached table, the table cache will be first uncached and then recache (lazily). Currently, the logic is embedded in CatalogImpl.refreshTable method.\r\nThe current implementation does not preserve the cache name and storage level. As a result, cache name and cache level could be changed after a REFERSH. IMHO, it is not what a user would expect.\r\nI would like to fix this behavior by first save the cache name and storage level for recaching the table.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTwo unit tests are added to make sure cache name is unchanged upon table refresh. Before applying this patch, the test created for qualified case would fail.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-26T13:33:19Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T00:43:32Z","closed_at":"2019-05-21T18:45:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d85d5e8e95671e5316c6ca14ce03fc6b297f026","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24221/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24221/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24221/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fc4a676c637a95ebef299c30e47fafc0be18f65e","head":{"label":"William1104:feature/SPARK-27248","ref":"feature/SPARK-27248","sha":"fc4a676c637a95ebef299c30e47fafc0be18f65e","user":{"login":"William1104","id":5646008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDYwMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5646008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104","html_url":"https://github.com/William1104","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":173449565,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzM0NDk1NjU=","name":"spark","full_name":"William1104/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"William1104","id":5646008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDYwMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5646008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104","html_url":"https://github.com/William1104","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/William1104/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIntersect  operator will be replace by Left Semi Join in Optimizer.\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\n```\r\nSELECT a1, a2 FROM Tab1 INTERSECT SELECT b1, b2 FROM Tab2\r\n ==>  SELECT DISTINCT a1, a2 FROM Tab1 LEFT SEMI JOIN Tab2 ON a1<=>b1 AND a2<=>b2\r\n```\r\n\r\nif Tabe1 and Tab2 are too large, the join will be very slow, we can reduce the table data before\r\nJoin by place groupby operator under join, that is \r\n```\r\n==>  \r\nSELECT a1, a2 FROM \r\n   (SELECT a1,a2 FROM Tab1 GROUP BY a1,a2) X\r\n   LEFT SEMI JOIN \r\n   (SELECT b1,b2 FROM Tab2 GROUP BY b1,b2) Y\r\nON X.a1<=>Y.b1 AND X.a2<=>Y.b2\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen we can have smaller table data when execute join, because  group by has cut lots of \r\n data.\r\n \r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRight now there are several issues in `EncryptedMessage.transferTo`:\r\n\r\n- When the underlying buffer has more than `1024 * 32` bytes (this should be rare but it could happen in error messages that send over the wire), it may just send a partial message as `EncryptedMessage.count` becomes less than `transferred`. This will cause the client hang forever (or timeout) as it will wait until receiving expected length of bytes, or weird errors (such as corruption or silent correctness issue) if the channel is reused by other messages.\r\n- When the underlying buffer is full, it's still trying to write out bytes in a busy loop.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes  the issues in `EncryptedMessage.transferTo` and also makes it follow the contract of `FileRegion`:\r\n\r\n- `count` should be a fixed value which is just the length of the whole message.\r\n- It should be non-blocking. When the underlying socket is not ready to write, it should give up and give control back.\r\n- `transferTo` should return the length of written bytes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe new added

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, we raise an AnalysisError when we detect the presense of aggregate expressions in where clause. Here is the problem description from the JIRA.\r\n\r\nAggregate functions should not be allowed in WHERE clause. But Spark SQL throws an exception when generating codes. It is supposed to throw an exception during parsing or analyzing.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.sql(\"select * from t where sum(ta) > 0\")\r\ndf.explain(true)\r\ndf.show()\r\n```\r\nResulting exception: \r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Cannot generate code for expression: sum(cast(input[0, int, false] as bigint))\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Unevaluable.doGenCode(Expression.scala:291)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Unevaluable.doGenCode$(Expression.scala:290)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.aggregate.AggregateExpression.doGenCode(interfaces.scala:87)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Expression.$anonfun$genCode$3(Expression.scala:138)\r\n\tat scala.Option.getOrElse(Option.scala:138)\r\n```\r\nChecked the behaviour of other database and all of them return an exception:\r\n**Postgress**\r\n```\r\nselect * from foo where max(c1) > 0;\r\nError\r\nERROR: aggregate functions are not allowed in WHERE Position: 25\r\n```\r\n**DB2**\r\n```\r\ndb2 => select * from foo where max(c1) > 0;\r\nSQL0120N  Invalid use of an aggregate function or OLAP function.  \r\n```\r\n**Oracle**\r\n```\r\nselect * from foo where max(c1) > 0;\r\nORA-00934: group function is not allowed here\r\n```\r\n**MySql**\r\n```\r\nselect * from foo where max(c1) > 0;\r\nInvalid use of group function\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\nThis PR has been enhanced to report error when expressions such as Aggregate, Window, Generate are hosted by operators where they are invalid. \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in AnalysisErrorSuite and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-20898 added a new configuration to blacklist a node/executor on fetch\r\nfailures. This config was deemed risky at the time and was disabled by default\r\nuntil more data is collected.\r\n\r\nThis commit aims to enable that feature by default as we have seen couple of\r\ninstances where that feature was found to be useful. Additionally, the commit\r\nchanges the blacklist criteria slightly.\r\n\r\nIf external shuffle service is not enabled, the commit will blacklist the\r\nexecutor immediately (on first fetch failure). This is consistent with the fact\r\nthat we delete all the shuffle outputs on that executor. So, I think it is\r\nuseful that we also blacklist that executor temporarily.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if external shuffle service is enabled, instead of blacklisting the\r\nnode immediately, it keeps track of all such fetch failures on that node. If\r\nunique and active fetch failures on that node exceed the configured threshold\r\n(it re-uses MAX_FAILED_EXEC_PER_NODE, but can be changed), then the node is also\r\nblacklisted. This will ensure that persistent issues with a node do not lead to\r\njob failures.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. Added a unit test case to ensure that blacklisting works as configured","created_at":"2019-03-25T18:17:03Z","updated_at":"2020-01-26T00:05:23Z","closed_at":"2020-01-26T00:05:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cdd85b94e25c7fa477fb2c1f273a12fd406dfb78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`Krb5LoginModule` supports debug parameter which is not yet supported from Spark side. This configuration makes it easier to debug authentication issues against Kafka.\r\n\r\nIn this PR `Krb5LoginModule` debug flag controlled by either `sun.security.krb5.debug` or `com.ibm.security.krb5.Krb5Debug`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally found some hardcoded values like `ssl.truststore.location`, etc... which could be error prone if Kafka changes it so in such cases Kafka define used.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting + additional unit tests + on cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-25T15:09:51Z","updated_at":"2019-04-11T23:42:12Z","closed_at":"2019-04-11T23:42:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"120a0e0d9ce839476bbb81763b0ec0795c7d5de9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24204/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24204/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24204/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b3c467b384c1c56e73a390fc12c87350def99dd4","head":{"label":"gaborgsomogyi:SPARK-27270","ref":"SPARK-27270","sha":"b3c467b384c1c56e73a390fc12c87350def99dd4","user":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":111547097,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTE1NDcwOTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"gaborgsomogyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, File source v2 allows each data source to specify the supported data types by implementing the method `supportsDataType` in `FileScan` and `FileWriteBuilder`.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the read path, the validation checks all the data types in `readSchema`, which might contain partition columns. This is actually a regression. E.g. Text data source only supports String data type, while the partition columns can still contain Integer type since partition columns are processed by Spark.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to:\r\n1. Refactor schema validation and check data schema only.\r\n2. Filter the partition columns in data schema if user specified schema provided.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n Unit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe current master doesn't support ANALYZE TABLE to collect tables stats for catalog views even if they are cached as follows;\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(s\"CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT 1 c\")\r\nscala> sql(s\"CACHE LAZY TABLE v\")\r\nscala> sql(s\"ANALYZE TABLE v COMPUTE STATISTICS\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: ANALYZE TABLE is not supported on views.;\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince SPARK-25196 has supported to an ANALYZE command to collect column statistics for cached catalog view, we could support table stats, too.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in `StatisticsCollectionSuite` and `InMemoryColumnarQuerySuite`.","created_at":"2019-03-25T05:58:12Z","updated_at":"2019-04-01T00:27:06Z","closed_at":"2019-04-01T00:27:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c0100c3488f5e20519c2147dc6ec9adcf19721bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24200/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24200/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24200/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7b66f0d9d08ef7a35b467aa6b57568b409110ad0","head":{"label":"maropu:SPARK-27266","ref":"SPARK-27266","sha":"7b66f0d9d08ef7a35b467aa6b57568b409110ad0","user":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27115199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNTE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"maropu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maropu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to deprecate the `from_utc_timestamp()` and `to_utc_timestamp`, and disable them by default. The functions can be enabled back via the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.utcTimestampFunc.enabled`. By default, any calls of the functions throw an analysis exception.\r\n\r\nOne of the reason for deprecation is functions violate semantic of `TimestampType` which is number of microseconds since epoch in UTC time zone. Shifting microseconds since epoch by time zone offset doesn't make sense because the result doesn't represent microseconds since epoch in UTC time zone any more, and cannot be considered as `TimestampType`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe changes were tested by `DateExpressionsSuite` and `DateFunctionsSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-24T22:38:06Z","updated_at":"2020-06-08T15:30:07Z","closed_at":"2019-04-03T02:58:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f76bf83160f5ccb21e4185d7222f9f0859986d32","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24195/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24195/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24195/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9f57bdcc4ed049b376521230a1d0dd97b4718620","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:conv-utc-timestamp-deprecate","ref":"conv-utc-timestamp-deprecate","sha":"9f57bdcc4ed049b376521230a1d0dd97b4718620","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhile submitting the spark application, passing multiple configurations not documented clearly, no examples given.it will be better if it can be documented since  clarity is less from spark documentation side.\r\nEven when i was browsing i could see few queries raised by users, below provided the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCloned session should prioritize `SQLConf` from parent's over `SparkConf`. Currently, when cloning a session, the child session has configuration set in `SparkConf` even when the same properties are set to its parent `SQLConf`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when a Spark session is cloned, `mergeSparkConf` in `BaseSessionStateBuilder`'s `conf` overwrites  `SQLConf` values as set in `SparkConf`.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to call `mergeSparkConf` only when the parent session is empty.\r\n\r\nSee below codes to read.\r\n\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, if we want to configure `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes` to 256 megabytes, we must set  `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes=268435456`, which is very unfriendly to users.\r\n\r\nAnd if we set it like this:`spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes=256M`, we will  encounter this exception:\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis makes the `CurrentDate` expression and `current_date` function independent from time zone settings. New result is number of days since epoch in `UTC` time zone. Previously, Spark shifted the current date (in `UTC` time zone) according the session time zone which violets definition of `DateType` - number of days since epoch (which is an absolute point in time, midnight of Jan 1 1970 in UTC time). \r\n\r\nThe changes makes `CurrentDate` consistent to `CurrentTimestamp` which is independent from time zone too. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe changes were tested by existing test suites like `DateExpressionsSuite`.","created_at":"2019-03-22T21:00:02Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T15:57:31Z","closed_at":"2019-03-29T01:46:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fcb08c2d77219110eb7ada9651a0baa443a72780","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24185/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24185/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24185/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cdb24aee62b7a1d8d0a6bdba1291782fbc4ee987","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:current-date","ref":"current-date","sha":"cdb24aee62b7a1d8d0a6bdba1291782fbc4ee987","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add an assert on `ScalarSubquery`'s `dataType` because there's a possibility that `dataType` can be called alone before throwing analysis exception.\r\n\r\nThis was found while working on [SPARK-27088](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27088). This change calls `treeString` for logging purpose, and the specific test \"scalar subquery with no column\" under `AnalysisErrorSuite` was being failed with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: sbt.ForkMain$ForkError: java.util.NoSuchElementException: next on empty iterator\r\n\t...\r\n\tat scala.collection.mutable.ArrayOps$ofRef.head(ArrayOps.scala:198)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.ScalarSubquery.dataType(subquery.scala:251)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Alias.dataType(namedExpressions.scala:163)\r\n        ...\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.trees.TreeNode.simpleString(TreeNode.scala:465)\r\n        ...\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.rules.RuleExecutor$PlanChangeLogger.logRule(RuleExecutor.scala:176)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.rules.RuleExecutor.$anonfun$execute$2(RuleExecutor.scala:116)\r\n\t...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is that `treeString` for logging happened to call `dataType` on `ScalarSubquery` but one test has empty column plan. So, it happened to throw `NoSuchElementException` before checking analysis.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`SelectedField` doesn't support map_keys and map_values for now. When map key or value is complex struct, we should be able to prune unnecessary fields from keys/values.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nNow that we support returning pandas DataFrame for struct type in Scalar Pandas UDF.\r\n\r\nIf we chain another Pandas UDF after the Scalar Pandas UDF returning pandas DataFrame, the argument of the chained UDF will be pandas DataFrame, but currently we don't support pandas DataFrame as an argument of Scalar Pandas UDF. That means there is an inconsistency between the chained UDF and the single UDF.\r\n\r\nWe should support taking pandas DataFrame for struct type argument in Scalar Pandas UDF to be consistent.\r\nCurrently pyarrow >=0.11 is supported.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified and added some

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`InMemoryFileIndex` needs to request file block location information in order to do locality schedule in `TaskSetManager`. \r\n\r\nUsually this is a time-cost task.  For example, In our production env, there are 24 partitions, with totally 149925 files and 83TB in size. It costs about 10 minutes to request file block locations before submit a spark job. Even though I set `spark.sql.sources.parallelPartitionDiscovery.threshold` to 24 to make it parallelized, it also needs 2 minutes. \r\n\r\nAnyway, this is a waste if we don't care about the locality of files(for example, storage and computation are separate).\r\n\r\nSo there should be a conf to control whether we need to send `getFileBlockLocations` request to HDFS NN. If user set `spark.locality.wait` to 0, file block location information is meaningless. \r\n\r\nHere in this PR, if `spark.locality.wait` is set to 0, it will not request file location information anymore, which will save several seconds to minutes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\ntested manually\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-22T03:43:46Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T02:08:38Z","closed_at":"2019-05-28T02:08:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c49073a19b402f7e72571a044ed2ee9c24d999d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24175/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24175/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24175/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5e873cb67513cd2b9906afac7a0bec20ad217677","head":{"label":"WangGuangxin:ignore_file_locality","ref":"ignore_file_locality","sha":"5e873cb67513cd2b9906afac7a0bec20ad217677","user":{"login":"WangGuangxin","id":1312321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTIzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1312321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin","html_url":"https://github.com/WangGuangxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163655040,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjM2NTUwNDA=","name":"spark","full_name":"WangGuangxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WangGuangxin","id":1312321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTIzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1312321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin","html_url":"https://github.com/WangGuangxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangGuangxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WangGuangxin/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the same APP, TableA and TableB are both hive Parquet tables, but TableA can't use the built-in Parquet reader and writer.\r\nIn this situation,  `spark.sql.hive.convertMetastoreParquet` can't control this well, so I think we can add a fine-grained configuration to handle this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPlease refer the description of [SPARK-27237](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27237) to see rationalization of this patch.\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to introduce state schema validation, via storing key schema and value schema to `schema` file (for the first time) and verify new key schema and value schema for state are compatible with existing one. To be clear for definition of \"compatible\", state schema is \"compatible\" when number of fields are same and data type for each field is same - Spark has been allowing rename of field.\r\n\r\nThis patch will prevent query run which has incompatible state schema, which would reduce the chance to get indeterministic behavior (actually renaming of field is also the smell of semantically incompatible, but end users could just modify its name so we can't say) as well as providing more informative error message.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UTs.","created_at":"2019-03-21T21:58:01Z","updated_at":"2022-01-11T08:29:48Z","closed_at":"2020-12-04T10:33:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"95653047d56cd50d0bb1d71eaf2df5d29319a914","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFirst time AppUI loading time will take time from the History server page, if the event log size is huge.\r\n(Eg: 47 minutes for a 18GB eventlog file). Majority of time is consumed for replaying the event log.\r\n\r\nIn this pr, I'm proposing a background caching for disk store, where history provider will replay the event log once the application completed and creates a store cache. So, when the user try to access the application, they can directly get from the cache or, provider will wait till the time caching is completed.\r\n\r\nEither case, the loading time will be lesser than or equal to the current one. Also, it is configurable and by default enabled. If disabled, behaviour will be same as before.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested and existing UT.\r\nEvent log size : 1.7 GB\r\n**Before:**\r\n First time UI loading time = 391 sec \r\n**After:**\r\n First time UI loading time =  6 sec ( Best case: Already cached)\r\n First time UI loading time  =  344 sec (worst case: Immedietly after background caching

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf we refresh a cached table, the table cache will be first uncached and then recache (lazily). Currently, the logic is embedded in CatalogImpl.refreshTable method. \r\n\r\nThe current implementation does not save the cache name and storage level. As a result, cache name and cache level could be changed after a REFERSH. IMHO, it is not what user expected. \r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR would like to fix this behavior by first save the cache name and storage level for recaching the table. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTwo new unit tests are added to \"CachedTableSuite\". To make sure cache name is not changed after table refreshing. Those test would fail without patching CatalogImpl with this PR.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-21T17:17:46Z","updated_at":"2019-03-22T16:15:59Z","closed_at":"2019-03-22T10:04:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d4875effc339c477dfd1081fcfe1d3fde5280f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24168/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24168/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24168/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/77ecac868b97c24a3b54ba808467a4a65a2b6f49","head":{"label":"William1104:feature/SPARK-27062","ref":"feature/SPARK-27062","sha":"77ecac868b97c24a3b54ba808467a4a65a2b6f49","user":{"login":"William1104","id":5646008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDYwMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5646008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104","html_url":"https://github.com/William1104","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":173449565,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzM0NDk1NjU=","name":"spark","full_name":"William1104/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"William1104","id":5646008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDYwMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5646008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104","html_url":"https://github.com/William1104","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William1104/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/William1104/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark locality wait mechanism is not friendly for large job, when number of tasks is large（e.g. 10000+）and with a large number of executors(e.g. 2000), executors may be launched on some nodes  where the locality is not the best(not the same nodes hold HDFS blocks). There are cases when `TaskSetManager.lastLaunchTime` is refreshed due to task finished within `spark.locality.wait` and re-launch new tasks, but due to there are only few of `PROCESS_LOCAL` executors, the launch rate is not fast enough to schedule all pending tasks soon, so that locality level could not be upgraded in time and lots of pending tasks will wait a long time. \r\n\r\nIn this case, when `spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true`, then lots of executors may be removed by Driver due to become idle and finally slow down the job.\r\n\r\nWe encountered this issue in our production spark cluster, it caused lots of resources wasting and slowed down user's application.\r\n\r\nThis PR will optimize this by following formula:\r\n\r\nSuppose numPendingTasks=10000, localityExecutionGainFactor=0.1, probabilityOfNextLocalitySchedule=0.5\r\n\r\n```\r\nmaxTolerableStarvingTime = numTasksCanRun * medianOfTaskExecutionTime * localityExecutionGainFactor * probabilityOfNextLocalitySchedule\r\n\r\ntotalStarvingTime = sum(starvingTimeByTasks)\r\n\r\nif (totalStarvingTime > maxTolerableStarvingTime)\r\n\r\n{  upgrading locality level... }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExist UT & added UT\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-21T12:02:37Z","updated_at":"2019-05-02T23:11:36Z","closed_at":"2019-05-02T23:11:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7792d9090c18fbba416ac9804f55942e9efcb526","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24167/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24167/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24167/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5abd9a45305b3e365991ad0f0dc9c69eaa080fec","head":{"label":"liupc:Upgrading-locality-level-when-there-are-lots-of-long-waiting-pending-tasks","ref":"Upgrading-locality-level-when-there-are-lots-of-long-waiting-pending-tasks","sha":"5abd9a45305b3e365991ad0f0dc9c69eaa080fec","user":{"login":"liupc","id":6747355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDczNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6747355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc","html_url":"https://github.com/liupc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75380071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTM4MDA3MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liupc/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liupc","id":6747355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDczNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6747355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc","html_url":"https://github.com/liupc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liupc/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pr related to #24119. Reduce the code duplicate when upgrading built-in Hive.\r\nTo achieve this, we should avoid using classes in `org.apache.orc.storage.*` because these classes will be replaced with `org.apache.hadoop.hive.*` after upgrading the built-in Hive. Such as:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5399861/54437594-e9be1000-476f-11e9-8878-3b7414871ee5.png)\r\n\r\n- Move the usage of `org.apache.orc.storage.*` to `OrcShimUtils`:\r\n1. Add wrapper for `VectorizedRowBatch`(Reduce code duplication of [OrcColumnarBatchReader](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24166/files#diff-e594f7295e5408c01ace8175166313b6)).\r\n2. Move some serializer/deserializer method out of `OrcDeserializer` and `OrcSerializer`(Reduce code duplication of [OrcDeserializer](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24166/files#diff-b933819e6dcaff41eee8fce1e8f2932c) and [OrcSerializer](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24166/files#diff-6d3849d88929f6ea25c436d71da729da)).\r\n3. Defined two type aliases: `Operator` and `SearchArgument`(Reduce code duplication of [OrcV1FilterSuite](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24166/files#diff-48c4fc7a3b3384a6d0aab246723a0058)).\r\n\r\n- Move duplication code to super class:\r\n1. Add a trait for `OrcFilters`(Reduce code duplication of [OrcFilters](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24166/files#diff-224b8cbedf286ecbfdd092d1e2e2f237)).\r\n2. Move `checkNoFilterPredicate` from `OrcFilterSuite` to `OrcTest`(Reduce code duplication of [OrcFilterSuite](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24166/files#diff-8e05c1faaaec98edd7723e62f84066f1)).\r\n\r\nAfter this pr. We only need to copy these 4 files: OrcColumnVector, OrcFilters, OrcFilterSuite and OrcShimUtils.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting tests\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-21T11:34:03Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T00:42:18Z","closed_at":"2019-03-26T00:41:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c3895ae75a72280004bd9b444b4b5653ebf379d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24166/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24166/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24166/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3e51b923d76fff7d69386d98b7e0f24dfd0e2390","head":{"label":"wangyum:SPARK-27226","ref":"SPARK-27226","sha":"3e51b923d76fff7d69386d98b7e0f24dfd0e2390","user":{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"be08b415dadd2725be2d2c8f8890a425fbad9338","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR extends the existing BROADCAST join hint (for both broadcast-hash join and broadcast-nested-loop join) by implementing other join strategy hints corresponding to the rest of Spark's existing join strategies: shuffle-hash, sort-merge, cartesian-product. The hint names: SHUFFLE_MERGE, SHUFFLE_HASH, SHUFFLE_REPLICATE_NL are partly different from the code names in order to make them clearer to users and reflect the actual algorithms better.\r\n\r\nThe hinted strategy will be used for the join with which it is associated if it is applicable/doable.\r\n\r\nConflict resolving rules in case of multiple hints:\r\n1. Conflicts within either side of the join: take the first strategy hint specified in the query, or the top hint node in Dataset. For example, in \"select /*+ merge(t1) */ /*+ broadcast(t1) */ k1, v2 from t1 join t2 on t1.k1 = t2.k2\", take \"merge(t1)\"; in ```df1.hint(\"merge\").hint(\"shuffle_hash\").join(df2)```, take \"shuffle_hash\". This is a general hint conflict resolving strategy, not specific to join strategy hint. \r\n2. Conflicts between two sides of the join:\r\n  a) In case of different strategy hints, hints are prioritized as ```BROADCAST``` over ```SHUFFLE_MERGE``` over ```SHUFFLE_HASH``` over ```SHUFFLE_REPLICATE_NL```.\r\n  b) In case of same strategy hints but conflicts in build side, choose the build side based on join type and size.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new UTs.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-21T03:31:34Z","updated_at":"2019-04-11T16:17:10Z","closed_at":"2019-04-11T16:17:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"24a78c0c2ad8af8e4c94df8f16318fc30be55983","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24164/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24164/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24164/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a9634c4b0e0d0a194bc4bfc3441528e7c4f836ae","head":{"label":"maryannxue:join-hints","ref":"join-hints","sha":"a9634c4b0e0d0a194bc4bfc3441528e7c4f836ae","user":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104110775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxMTA3NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"maryannxue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue that ClientEndpoint in standalone cluster doesn't recognize about driver options which are passed to SparkConf instead of system properties. When `Client` is executed via cli they should be provided as system properties, but with `spark-submit` they can be provided as SparkConf. (SpartSubmit will call `ClientApp.start` with SparkConf which would contain these options.)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested via following steps:\r\n\r\n1) setup standalone cluster (launch master and worker via `./sbin/start-all.sh`) \r\n\r\n2) submit one of example app with standalone cluster mode\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi --master \"spark://localhost:7077\" --conf \"spark.driver.extraJavaOptions=-Dfoo=BAR\" --deploy-mode \"cluster\" --num-executors 1 --driver-memory 512m --executor-memory 512m --executor-cores 1 examples/jars/spark-examples*.jar 10\r\n```\r\n\r\n3) check whether `foo=BAR` is provided in system properties in Spark UI\r\n\r\n<img width=\"877\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen `TreeNode.parseToJson` may throw an assert error without any error message when a TreeNode is not implemented properly, and it's hard to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to avoid the `TimeZone` to `ZoneId` conversion in `DateTimeUtils.stringToTimestamp` by changing signature of the method, and require a parameter of `ZoneId` type. This will allow to avoid unnecessary conversion (`TimeZone` -> `String` -> `ZoneId`) per each row.\r\n\r\nAlso the PR avoids creation of `ZoneId` instances from `ZoneOffset` because `ZoneOffset` is a sub-class, and the conversion is unnecessary too. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested by `DateTimeUtilsSuite` and `CastSuite`.","created_at":"2019-03-20T11:07:46Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T15:57:23Z","closed_at":"2019-03-22T09:04:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f0a6cc13cd305e357e6cbd0b4fec84942f9f3aac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24155/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24155/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24155/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b4632bcdc51cac7c1e7c6cdf6d8535121ae3d974","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:stringtotimestamp-zoneid","ref":"stringtotimestamp-zoneid","sha":"b4632bcdc51cac7c1e7c6cdf6d8535121ae3d974","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTries the address the concern mentioned in [SPARK-26739](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26739)\r\nTo summarise, currently, in the join functions on DataFrames, the join types are defined via a string parameter called joinType. In order for a developer to know which joins are possible, they must look up the API call for join. While this works fine, it can cause the developer to make a typo resulting in improper joins and/or unexpected errors that aren't evident at compile time. The objective of this improvement would be to allow developers to use a common definition for join types (by enum or constants) called JoinTypes. This would contain the possible joins and remove the possibility of a typo.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently in the grammar file the rule `query` is responsible to parse both select and insert statements. As a result, we need to have more semantic checks in the code to guard against in-valid insert constructs in a query. Couple of examples are in the `visitCreateView` and `visitAlterView` functions. One other issue is that, we don't catch the `invalid insert constructs` in all the places until checkAnalysis (the errors we raise can be confusing as well). Here are couple of examples :\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nselect * from (insert into bar values (2));\r\n```\r\n```\r\nError in query: unresolved operator 'Project [*];\r\n'Project [*]\r\n+- SubqueryAlias `__auto_generated_subquery_name`\r\n   +- InsertIntoHiveTable `default`.`bar`, org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe, false, false, [c1]\r\n      +- Project [cast(col1#18 as int) AS c1#20]\r\n         +- LocalRelation [col1#18]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nselect * from foo where c1 in (insert into bar values (2))\r\n```\r\n```\r\nError in query: cannot resolve '(default.foo.`c1` IN (listquery()))' due to data type mismatch: \r\nThe number of columns in the left hand side of an IN subquery does not match the\r\nnumber of columns in the output of subquery.\r\n#columns in left hand side: 1.\r\n#columns in right hand side: 0.\r\n\r\nLeft side columns:\r\n[default.foo.`c1`].\r\nRight side columns:\r\n[].;;\r\n'Project [*]\r\n+- 'Filter c1#6 IN (list#5 [])\r\n   :  +- InsertIntoHiveTable `default`.`bar`, org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe, false, false, [c1]\r\n   :     +- Project [cast(col1#7 as int) AS c1#9]\r\n   :        +- LocalRelation [col1#7]\r\n   +- SubqueryAlias `default`.`foo`\r\n      +- HiveTableRelation `default`.`foo`, org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe, [c1#6]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor both the cases above, we should reject the syntax at parser level.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we create two top-level parser rules to parse `SELECT` and `INSERT` respectively.\r\nI will create a small PR to allow CTEs in DESCRIBE QUERY after this PR is in.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to PlanParserSuite and removed the semantic check tests from

the aggregate operations that are invoked for an aggregation buffer for User Defined Aggregate Functions(UDAF) follow the order like initialize(), update(), eval() OR initialize(), merge(), eval(). However, after a certain threshold configurable by spark.sql.objectHashAggregate.sortBased.fallbackThreshold is reached, ObjectHashAggregate falls back to SortBasedAggregator which invokes the merge or update operation without calling initialize() on the aggregate buffer.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe fix here is to initialize aggregate buffers again when fallback to SortBasedAggregate operator happens.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe patch was tested as part of [SPARK-24935](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24935) as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[SPARK-26977](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26977) introduced very strange bug which spark-shell is no longer able to load classes which are provided via `--packages`. TBH I don't know about the details why it is broken, but looks like initializing `object class` brings the weirdness (maybe due to static initialization done twice?).\r\n\r\nThis patch removes the logic to leave warning log when main class is scala.App, to not deal with such complexity for just leaving warning message.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual test: suppose we run spark-shell with `--packages` option like below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-shell --verbose   --master \"local[*]\" --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.11:2.4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this patch, importing class in transitive dependency fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsing Spark's default log4j profile: org/apache/spark/log4j-defaults.properties\r\nSetting default log level to \"WARN\".\r\nTo adjust logging level use sc.setLogLevel(newLevel). For SparkR, use setLogLevel(newLevel).\r\nSpark context Web UI available at http://localhost:4040\r\nSpark context available as 'sc' (master = local[*], app id = local-1553005771597).\r\nSpark session available as 'spark'.\r\nWelcome to\r\n      ____              __\r\n     / __/__  ___ _____/ /__\r\n    _\\ \\/ _ \\/ _ `/ __/  '_/\r\n   /___/ .__/\\_,_/_/ /_/\\_\\   version 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n      /_/\r\n\r\nUsing Scala version 2.12.8 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_191)\r\nType in expressions to have them evaluated.\r\nType :help for more information.\r\n\r\nscala> import org.apache.kafka\r\n<console>:23: error: object kafka is not a member of package org.apache\r\n       import org.apache.kafka\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this patch, importing class in transitive dependency succeeds:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsing Spark's default log4j profile: org/apache/spark/log4j-defaults.properties\r\nSetting default log level to \"WARN\".\r\nTo adjust logging level use sc.setLogLevel(newLevel).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHive UDAF knows the aggregation mode when creating the aggregation buffer, so that it can create different buffers for different inputs: the original data or the aggregation buffer. Please see an example in the [sketches library](https://github.com/DataSketches/sketches-hive/blob/7f9e76e9e03807277146291beb2c7bec40e8672b/src/main/java/com/yahoo/sketches/hive/cpc/DataToSketchUDAF.java#L107).\r\n\r\nHowever, the Hive UDAF adapter in Spark always creates the buffer with partial1 mode, which can only deal with one input: the original data. This PR fixes it.\r\n\r\nAll credits go to @pgandhi999 , who investigate the problem and study the Hive UDAF behaviors, and write the tests.\r\n\r\nclose
