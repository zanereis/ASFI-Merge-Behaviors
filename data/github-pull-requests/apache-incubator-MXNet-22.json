Description ##\r\nI know we're moving towards cmake build system.\r\n\r\nThis is to address the co-existence of iomp5 and gomp when building mxnet with USE_BLAS=MKL in Makefile. I want to verify this change with CI.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-26T08:41:59Z","updated_at":"2022-03-14T23:48:12Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a48d16a41dd7962ed98c8bccc75a71fb19dc3f25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis is a supplementary patch for #16772.\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv @ZhennanQin @zhreshold \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-26T02:53:59Z","updated_at":"2020-02-29T13:25:20Z","closed_at":"2020-02-29T13:17:38Z","merged_at":"2020-02-29T13:17:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"88b3051f290c994daed5cac7c9724319b7b6aba0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17689/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17689/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17689/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/55c57f1a0c7621f1e02186980bd8328b3f90d345","head":{"label":"wuxun-zhang:MKLDNNRun_patch","ref":"MKLDNNRun_patch","sha":"55c57f1a0c7621f1e02186980bd8328b3f90d345","user":{"login":"wuxun-zhang","id":34727741,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzI3NzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34727741?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang","html_url":"https://github.com/wuxun-zhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163937530,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjM5Mzc1MzA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"wuxun-zhang/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wuxun-zhang","id":34727741,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzI3NzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34727741?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang","html_url":"https://github.com/wuxun-zhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wuxun-zhang/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nBatchNormRelu Fusion while training.\r\n\r\nMain changes for this feature are:\r\n1)\tImplement `mx.nd.contrib.BatchNormWithReLU` operator and place it in `src/operator/contrib/` directory;\r\n2)\tAdd a parameter to gluon interface `nn.BatchNorm(fuse_relu=True, **kwargs)` to call `mx.nd.contrib.BatchNormWithReLU` instead of `mx.nd.BatchNorm`\r\n\r\nFor users who wants to use this feature, he needs to:\r\n1)\tSymbolic: call `mx.sym.contrib.BatchNormWithReLU` directly to replace `mx.sym.BatchNorm` and `mx.sym.Activation`;\r\n2)\tGluon: Add layer `nn.BatchNorm(fuse_relu=True)` instead of `[nn.BatchNorm(), nn.Activation()]`\r\n\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable

Description ##\r\nThe cumsum op was previously breaking on large tensor (dimension > 2^32) data. With the following input:\r\n```\r\nrun_performance_test(nd.cumsum, inputs=[{\"a\": nd.random_normal(shape=(2**32 + 1, 1))}], run_backward=True, warmup=1, runs=1)\r\n```\r\nthe following error was thrown:\r\n```\r\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo root cause this issue, I ran the previous command in a Python script with GDB, and found that the underlying problem was in the data type of several variables in the forward/backward structs in `np_cumsum-inl.h.h`. These variables used the `int` dtype when they should have been using `index_t` to properly handle long int indices. I switched these variables to `index_t` in the struct header and, after rebuilding, the previous input command displayed the correct output:\r\n```\r\nINFO:root:Begin Benchmark - cumsum\r\nINFO:root:Complete Benchmark - cumsum\r\n[{'cumsum': [{'inputs': {'a': '<NDArray 4294967297x1 @cpu(0)>'}, 'max_storage_mem_alloc_cpu/0': 33285996.0, 'avg_time_forward_cumsum': 4366.7148, 'avg_time_backward_cumsum': 12744.9971}]}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo ensure completeness and to prevent future breaking changes, I also added a nightly test for the cumsum op with large tensor data in `tests/nightly/test_large_array.py`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- M src/operator/numpy/np_cumsum-inl.h\r\n- M tests/nightly/test_large_array.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTested on r5dn.24xl-ubuntu 16.04 with\r\n1.

Description ##\r\nThe multi_lars op was previously breaking on large tensor (dimension >= 2^32) data. With the following input:\r\n```\r\nrun_performance_test(nd.multi_lars, inputs=[{\"lrs\": nd.random_normal(shape=(2**32 + 1, 1)), \"weights_sum_sq\": nd.random_normal(shape=(2**32 + 1, 1)), \"grads_sum_sq\": nd.random_normal(shape=(2**32 + 1, 1)), \"wds\": nd.random_normal(shape=(2**32 + 1, 1)), \"eta\": .1, \"eps\": .9}], run_backward=False, warmup=1, runs=1)\r\n```\r\nthe following error was thrown:\r\n```\r\nSegmentation fault: 11\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo root cause this issue, I ran the previous command in a Python script with GDB, and found that the underlying problem was in the data type of the `MultiLARS` kernel in `multi_lars-inl.h.h`. The index variable `i` used the `int` dtype when it should have been using `index_t` to properly handle long int indices. I switched this variable to `index_t` in the struct header and, after rebuilding, the previous input command displayed the correct output:\r\n```\r\nINFO:root:Begin Benchmark - multi_lars\r\nINFO:root:Complete Benchmark - multi_lars\r\n[{'multi_lars': [{'inputs': {'lrs': '<NDArray 4294967297x1 @cpu(0)>', 'weights_sum_sq': '<NDArray 4294967297x1 @cpu(0)>', 'grads_sum_sq': '<NDArray 4294967297x1 @cpu(0)>', 'wds': '<NDArray 4294967297x1 @cpu(0)>', 'eta': 0.1, 'eps': 0.9}, 'max_storage_mem_alloc_cpu/0': 16106127.0, 'avg_time_forward_multi_lars': 4904.6128}]}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo ensure completeness and to prevent future breaking changes, I also added a nightly test for the multi_lars op with large tensor data in `tests/nightly/test_large_array.py`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- M src/operator/contrib/multi_lars-inl.h\r\n- M tests/nightly/test_large_array.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTested on r5dn.24xl-ubuntu 16.04 with\r\n1.

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-24T13:03:02Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T06:03:02Z","closed_at":"2020-03-03T06:03:02Z","merged_at":"2020-03-03T06:03:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"9b7132b7acb5e3725e5004c9b8b0f9793f994a14","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17673/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17673/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17673/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/a725174954bddf4b072dd20fd5a8502a0e9b356b","head":{"label":"rongzha1:fix_bf16_bn_test_fail","ref":"fix_bf16_bn_test_fail","sha":"a725174954bddf4b072dd20fd5a8502a0e9b356b","user":{"login":"rongzha1","id":28431214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDMxMjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28431214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongzha1","html_url":"https://github.com/rongzha1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongzha1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongzha1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongzha1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongzha1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongzha1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongzha1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongzha1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongzha1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongzha1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d51753bd87fb24509c01b7e9f8f638dd1026c515","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis decorator is for debug purpose, a user could use this on top of a function implemented in DeepNumPy and that function will actually run using the official numpy module.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\nimplement storage tagging, the first half of the memory profiler\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] This PR is the first half of the GPU memory profiler. It implements storage tagging which adds profiler scope, name, and data structure information to each allocated storage handle.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Example ####\r\n```Python\r\n    profiler.set_state('run')\r\n\r\n    model = nn.HybridSequential(prefix='net_')\r\n    with model.name_scope():\r\n        model.add(nn.Dense(128, activation='tanh'))\r\n        model.add(nn.Dropout(0.5))\r\n        model.add(nn.Dense(64, activation='tanh'),\r\n                  nn.Dense(32, in_units=64))\r\n        model.add(nn.Activation('relu'))\r\n    model.initialize(ctx=mx.gpu())\r\n    model.hybridize()\r\n\r\n    inputs = mx.sym.var('data')\r\n\r\n    with mx.autograd.record():\r\n        out = model(mx.nd.zeros((16, 10), ctx=mx.gpu()))\r\n    out.backward()\r\n    mx.nd.waitall()\r\n    profiler.set_state('stop')\r\n    profiler.dump(True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code snippet above will generate the following `gpu_memory_profile.csv`:\r\n\r\n|Attribute Name                                   |Requested Size|Device|Actual

test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] gluon: clip_global_norm was modified to use mxnet.nd.multi_sum_sq op and compute the sumSq of several arrays in parallel\r\n- [x] Test in tests/python/gpu/test_gluon_gpu:test_global_norm_clip_multi_device was extended to have 2 arrays on gpu(0) and 2 arrays on cpu(0), so that multi-tensor sumSq is tested for each of these

Description ##\r\nUse cmake build for most CI builds in preparation of dropping Makefile build\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17548\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThe following Makefile based builds are preserved\r\n1) staticbuild scripts. Changes to CD pipeline will happen in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17646\r\n2) Docs builds. Language binding specific build logic requires further changes\r\n3) Jetson build. Jetpack 3.3 toolchain based on Cuda 9.0 causes 'Internal\r\n   Compiler Error (codegen): \"there was an error in verifying the lgenfe\r\n   output!\"' errors with cmake. This seems to be a known issue in Cuda 9.0 and\r\n   we need to update Jetpack toolchain to work around it.\r\n4) MKL builds. Waiting for fix of https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17641\r\n\r\nImprovements to CMake build\r\n- Enable -Werror for RelWithDebugInfo build in analogy to \"make DEV=1\" build\r\n- Add USE_LIBJPEG_TURBO to CMake build\r\n- Improve finding Python 3 executable\r\n\r\nChanges to CI setup\r\n- Install protobuf in ubuntu_core.sh and centos_core.sh\r\n- Install up-to-date CMake on Centos 7\r\n- Don't use RelWithDebInfo on Android builds, as gcc 4.9 throws\r\n  -Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor\r\n\r\nCode changes\r\n- Locally disable warnings introduced by

Description ##\r\nThe ravel_multi_index op was previously breaking on large tensor (dimension >= 2^32) data. With the following input:\r\n```\r\nrun_performance_test(nd.ravel_multi_index, inputs=[{\"data\": (2, 2**32), \"shape\":(2, 10)}], run_backward=True, warmup=1, runs=1)\r\n```\r\nthe following error was thrown:\r\n```\r\nSegmentation fault: 11\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo root cause this issue, I ran the previous command in a Python script with GDB, and found that the underlying problem was in the header of the `ravel_index` struct in `ravel.h`. The index variable `i` used the `int` dtype when it should have been using `index_t` to properly handle long int indices. I switched this variable to `index_t` in the struct header and, after rebuilding, the previous input command displayed the correct output:\r\n```\r\nINFO:root:Begin Benchmark - ravel_multi_index\r\nINFO:root:Complete Benchmark - ravel_multi_index\r\n[{'ravel_multi_index': [{'inputs': {'data': (2, 4294967296), 'shape': (2, 10)}, 'max_storage_mem_alloc_cpu/0': 24696062.0, 'avg_time_forward_ravel_multi_inde\r\nx': 4257.312}]}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo ensure completeness and to prevent future breaking changes, I also added a nightly test for the ravel_multi_index op with large tensor data in `tests/nightly/test_large_array.py`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- M src/operator/ravel.h\r\n- M tests/nightly/test_large_array.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTested on r5dn.24xl-ubuntu 16.04 and p2.16xl-ubuntu 16.04 with\r\n1.

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

Description ##\r\nThe Softmax Activation op was previously breaking on large tensor (dimension >= 2^32) data. With the following input:\r\n```\r\nrun_performance_test(nd.SoftmaxActivation, run_backward=True, inputs=[{'data': (2**29,2,2,2), 'out': nd.random_normal(shape=(2**29,2,2,2))}], warmup=1, runs=1)\r\n```\r\nthe following error was thrown:\r\n```\r\nTBlob.get_with_shape: Check failed: this->shape_.Size() == static_cast<size_t>(shape.Size()) (4294967296 vs. 0) : new and old shape do not match total elements\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo root cause this issue, I ran the previous command in a Python script with GDB, and found that the underlying problem was in the shape construction logic of `softmax_activation-inl.h`. In the functions for computing the forward pass result and the gradient, several of the variables used the `int` dtype when they should have been using `index_t` to properly handle long int dimensions. I switched these variables to `index_t` and, after rebuilding, the previous input command displayed the correct output:\r\n```\r\nINFO:root:Begin Benchmark - SoftmaxActivation\r\nINFO:root:Complete Benchmark - SoftmaxActivation\r\n[{'SoftmaxActivation': [{'inputs': {'data': (536870912, 2, 2, 2), 'out': '<NDArray 536870912x2x2x2 @cpu(0)>'}, 'max_storage_mem_alloc_cpu/0': 24696062.0, 'avg_time_forward_SoftmaxActivation': 7426.1191, 'avg_time_backward_SoftmaxActivation': 16664.0254}]}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo ensure completeness and to prevent future breaking changes, I also added a nightly test for the Softmax Activation op with large tensor data in `tests/nightly/test_large_array.py`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- M src/operator/nn/softmax_activation-inl.h\r\n- M tests/nightly/test_large_array.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTested on r5dn.24xl-ubuntu 16.04 and p2.16xl-ubuntu 16.04 with\r\n1.

Description ##\r\nThe RNN op was previously breaking on large tensor (dimension >= 2^32) data. With the following input:\r\n```\r\nrun_performance_test(nd.RNN, run_backward=True, inputs=[{'data': (2**28,4,4), 'parameters': nd.random_normal(shape=(7,)), 'state': nd.random_normal(shape=(1, 4, 1)), 'mode': 'rnn_relu', 'state_size': 1, 'num_layers': 1}], warmup=1, runs=1)\r\n```\r\nthe following error was thrown:\r\n```\r\nMXNetError: Check failed: dim_size >= -1 (-2147483640 vs. -1) : shape dim size must be >= -1, while received -2147483640\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo root cause this issue, I ran the previous command in a Python script with GDB, and found that the underlying problem was in several of the function definitions of `rnn-inl.h`. Several of the data variables (`input_size`, `batch_size`, and `seq_length`) used the `int` dtype when they should have been using `index_t` to properly handle long int dimensions. I switched these variables to `index_t` in the relevant function headers and, after rebuilding, the previous input command displayed the correct output:\r\n```\r\nINFO:root:Begin Benchmark - RNN\r\nINFO:root:Complete Benchmark - RNN\r\n[{'RNN': [{'inputs': {'data': (268435456, 4, 4), 'parameters': '<NDArray 7 @cpu(0)>', 'state': '<NDArray 1x4x1 @cpu(0)>', 'mode': 'rnn_relu', 'state_size': 1, 'num_layers': 1}, 'max_storage_mem_alloc_cpu/0': 27917288.0, 'avg_time_forward_RNN': 1244353.25, 'avg_time_backward_RNN': 1345001.375}]}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this only accounted for running the RNN op in `relu` mode. The op currently supports 3 other modes: `rnn_tanh`, `lstm`, and `gru`. To ensure that the op worked with large tensor data in each of these three modes in addition to `relu` mode, I made extensive modifications to `rnn_impl.h`. My modifications involved changing the data type of many function parameters and local variables for forward and backward functions for these three modes.\r\n\r\nTo ensure completeness and to prevent future breaking changes, I also added a nightly test for the RNN op with large tensor data in `tests/nightly/test_large_array.py`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- M src/operator/rnn-inl.h\r\n- M src/operator/rnn_impl.h\r\n- M tests/nightly/test_large_array.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTested on r5dn.24xl-ubuntu 16.04 and p2.16xl-ubuntu 16.04 with\r\n1.

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds support for passing the NDArrays from the existing `optimize_for` API down to the `reviewSubgraph` function in an external library. It also adds a new API for HybridBlock called `optimize_for` that can partition the model without running a forward pass. \r\n### Feature changes\r\n- Adds new API to HybridBlock `optimize_for` that partitions the model but does not call the cachedOp\r\n- Modifies the subgraph library example to optionally require args to be provided\r\n- Adds annotation on subgraph inputs for the name of the original param so that inputs can be mapped and passes annotations to input nodes of subgraphs\r\n- Adds support for tensors in MKLDNN format, calls `Reorder2Default`\r\n### New tests\r\n- Adds a new test to partition operators that directly consume params\r\n- add a new model to test where ops to be partitioned have args/params\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n- fixes bug in passing `ids` vector by value instead of by reference\r\n- fixes bug in passing copies of attributes instead of by reference\r\n- fixes bug where `_cached_graph` was not updated after partitioning\r\n- fixes memory leak where user-specified attributes on subgraph ops were not freed if subgraph was rejected\r\n- fixes problem incorrectly indexing into shape/dtype maps when annotating the graph\r\n### Docs\r\n- Updates the README doc with the latest changes described above\r\n\r\n## Design - Passing NDArrays ##\r\nIn #15886 the `optimize_for` API was added  to the Symbol class to give users an easy API to use to partition their models. The `args` argument took the params to the model to use for shape/type inference. But the NDArray values were never used. In this PR, we pass the NDArray data values to the backend library and also add the ability to pass auxiliary params too. Now, the `optimize_for` API looks like:\r\n```\r\nsym = sym.optimize_for('default', args, aux, ctx=mx.cpu())\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the backend library side, the `reviewSubgraph` API has an additional arguments for `args` and `aux` that are maps of named MXTensors. \r\n```\r\nMXReturnValue reviewSubgraph(std::string json, int subraph_id, bool* accept,\r\n                             std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string>& options,\r\n                             std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string>& attrs) {\r\n                             std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string>& attrs,\r\n                             std::map<std::string, MXTensor>& args,\r\n                             std::map<std::string, MXTensor>& aux);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese additional maps of args and aux will allow backends to compile subgraphs and use param/weight values during compilation. For example, this will enable TensorRT to be implemented as a backend library and eliminate the `init_tensorrt_params` API that is needed to provide the params to the TensorRT backend. It will also enable compiling subgraphs with TVM and other compile-centric backends. \r\n\r\nThis PR also tags subgraph inputs with a new attribute \"argName\" if the input to the subgraph comes directly from a model param/weight. This will be used when backend libraries lookup params for subgraph inputs since the names of subgraph inputs are modified from the original model param name. The \"argName\" can be looked up in the new `args` or `aux` arguments passed to the `reviewSubgraph` API to get the actual tensor values. Heres an example partitioned graph, notice that the original input param is named `a` and the input to the subgraph is named `a0`. You can see the \"argName\" attribute is set on the input refer to original name `a`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"nodes\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"op\": \"null\", \r\n      \"name\": \"a\", \r\n      \"attrs\": {\r\n        \"dtype\": \"0\", \r\n        \"shape\": \"[3,2]\"\r\n      }, \r\n      \"inputs\": []\r\n    }, \r\n    {\r\n      \"op\": \"_custom_subgraph_op\", \r\n      \"name\": \"_op0\", \r\n      \"attrs\": {\"myKey\": \"myVal\"}, \r\n      \"inputs\": [[0, 0, 0]], \r\n      \"subgraphs\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"nodes\": [\r\n            {\r\n              \"op\": \"null\", \r\n              \"name\": \"a0\", \r\n              \"attrs\": {\r\n                \"argName\": \"a\", \r\n                \"isArg\": \"True\", \r\n                \"isAux\": \"False\"\r\n              }, \r\n              \"inputs\": []\r\n            }, \r\n\r\n            ...\r\n\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  ], \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Design - Partitioning HybridBlock without infer ##\r\nIn #15969 the `hybridize` API was modified to accept the backend name and partition the model during the hybridize flow. This flow is for users who intend to run inference immediately after partitioning. But for users that want to partition but not run inference, they are out of luck. When compiling the model, a user will compile on a machine suitable for compilation. And that compilation may take tens of minutes depending on the model and optimization strategy. Then they will export their model, and copy it to the machine they intent to run inference on. \r\n\r\nIn this flow, the machine for running compilation may not be suitable for running a complete forward pass. In this PR we add an `optimize_for` API to the HybridBlock class that runs most of what is part of the hybridize flow including the forward pass. But it does not actually call the cachedOp. \r\n\r\nThe new HybridBlock `optimize_for` API combines the argument lists of `forward` and `hybridize` like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef optimize_for(self, x, *args, backend=None, backend_opts=None, **kwargs)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that the first two args are the same as in the `forward` API and the last 3 args are the same as in the `hybridize` API. The `active` argument is dropped since it will default to true in this function in order to partition the model. \r\n\r\nThe expectation is that users will do the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nblock.optimize_for(x, backend='myProp')\r\nblock.export('partitioned')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is equivalent to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nblock.hybridize(backend='myProp')\r\nblock(x)\r\nblock.export('partitioned')\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut does not actually execute the forward pass. Users can still use the partitioned block to run forward passes just like with hybridize, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nblock.optimize_for(x, backend='myProp')\r\nblock(x)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCalling `optimize_for` is equivalent to `hybridize` in this usage, and since the cachedOp is already created before `block(x)`, it is not recreated during the forward pass. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n###

Description ##\r\nThe col2im op was previously breaking on large tensor (dimension >= 2^32) data. With the following input:\r\n```\r\nrun_performance_test(nd.col2im, run_backward=True, inputs=[{'data': (1,2**30,4), 'output_size': (2,2,1), 'kernel': (1,1,1)}], warmup=1, runs=1)\r\n```\r\nthe following error was thrown:\r\n```\r\nSegmentation fault: 11\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo root cause this issue, I ran the previous command in a Python script with GDB, and found that the underlying problem was in the dtype of the image index variable (`index_im`) within the col2im op's kernel in `im2col.h`. This image index variable used the `int` dtype when it should have been using `index_t` to properly handle long int indices. I switched this variable to `index_t` in the kernel and, after rebuilding, the previous input command displayed the correct output:\r\n```\r\nINFO:root:Begin Benchmark - col2im\r\nINFO:root:Complete Benchmark - col2im\r\n[{'col2im': [{'inputs': {'data': (1, 1073741824, 4), 'output_size': (2, 2, 1), 'kernel': (1, 1, 1)}, 'max_storage_mem_alloc_cpu/0': 33285996.0, 'avg_time_forward_col2im': 1290522.25, 'avg_time_backward_col2im': 1291033.5}]}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: I also confirmed that, with my revisions, the op works with a large tensor (>= 2^32) output size, as the following command passes without errors.\r\n```\r\nrun_performance_test(nd.col2im, run_backward=True, inputs=[{'data': (1,2**32,1), 'output_size': (1,2**32), 'kernel': (1,2**32)}], warmup=1, runs=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- M src/operator/nn/im2col.h\r\n- M tests/nightly/test_large_array.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTested on r5dn.24xl-ubuntu 16.04 and p2.16xl-ubuntu 16.04 with\r\n1.

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\nThe Spatial Transformer op was previously breaking on large tensor (dimension >= 2^32) data. With the following input:\r\n```\r\nrun_performance_test(nd.SpatialTransformer, run_backward=True, inputs=[{'data': (2, 2**29,1,6), 'loc': nd.random_normal(shape=(2,6)), 'transform_type': 'affine', 'sampler_type': 'bilinear', 'target_shape': (2,6)}], warmup=1, runs=1)\r\n```\r\nthe following error was thrown:\r\n```\r\n*** Error in `python3': double free or corruption (out): 0x00007f36bbffe010 ***\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo root cause this issue, I ran the previous command in a Python script with GDB, and found that the underlying problem was in the iteration portion of the forward and backward methods of `spatial_transformer.cc`. Several of the variables used in the iteration used the `int` dtype when they should have been using `index_t` to properly handle long int indices. I switched these variables to `index_t` in the forward and backward methods, and after rebuilding, the previous input command displayed the correct output:\r\n```\r\nINFO:root:Begin Benchmark - SpatialTransformer\r\nINFO:root:Complete Benchmark - SpatialTransformer\r\n[{'SpatialTransformer': [{'inputs': {'data': (2, 536870912, 1, 6), 'loc': '<NDArray 2x6 @cpu(0)>', 'transform_type': 'affine', 'sampler_type': 'bilinear', 't\r\narget_shape': (2, 6)}, 'max_storage_mem_alloc_cpu/0': 102005472.0, 'avg_time_forward_SpatialTransformer': 551614.125, 'avg_time_backward_SpatialTransformer':\r\n 511034.0938}]}]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- M src/operator/tensor/spatial_transformer.cc\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTested on r5dn.24xl-ubuntu 16.04 and p2.16xl-ubuntu 16.04 with\r\n1.

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-17T04:34:44Z","updated_at":"2020-02-24T04:58:15Z","closed_at":"2020-02-24T04:58:15Z","merged_at":"2020-02-24T04:58:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"564d26313ef9d5cd72ee6563c5e7744ac3b25f7b","assignee":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17611/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17611/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17611/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/a77b933b59047027a62caf1ce4140807dc6faa48","head":{"label":"Tommliu:quantile_scalar_test","ref":"quantile_scalar_test","sha":"a77b933b59047027a62caf1ce4140807dc6faa48","user":{"login":"Tommliu","id":40382964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzgyOTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40382964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu","html_url":"https://github.com/Tommliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":219631509,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTk2MzE1MDk=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"Tommliu/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Tommliu","id":40382964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzgyOTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40382964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu","html_url":"https://github.com/Tommliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Tommliu/incubator-mxnet","description":"

Description ##\r\nThis PR implements a mechanism of easily falling back to the official NumPy if operators do not have the corresponding native implementations in MXNet. This allows us to quickly have a decent coverage of NumPy operators in order to test MXNet as a backend compute engine for other machine learning libraries heavily depending on NumPy, such as sklearn, while adding more operators with native implementations in parallel.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism implemented in this PR only supports calling operators in the imperative way without autograd, i.e., through the module `mxnet.numpy`. More sophisticated fallback mechanism for supporting symbolic paradigm and autograd should resort to https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/16923.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-16T13:43:31Z","updated_at":"2020-06-30T02:56:52Z","closed_at":"2020-02-19T04:56:14Z","merged_at":"2020-02-19T04:56:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"a11a9f9a8a0d412e421a87263dad9a4cde076d11","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17609/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17609/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17609/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/a36fd2a95be150be2ad99125cf814c69e0d02c41","head":{"label":"Yiyan66:fallback_test","ref":"fallback_test","sha":"a36fd2a95be150be2ad99125cf814c69e0d02c41","user":{"login":"Yiyan66","id":57363390,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzYzMzkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57363390?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66","html_url":"https://github.com/Yiyan66","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":221351337,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjEzNTEzMzc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"Yiyan66/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Yiyan66","id":57363390,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzYzMzkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57363390?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66","html_url":"https://github.com/Yiyan66","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Yiyan66/incubator-mxnet","description":"L

Description ##\r\nTo support the broadcast_like operation for mx.np.ndarray in Numpy Extensions for the reseaon that the broadcast_to and broadcast_arrrays are not availble for symbol currently.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Additional operation supporting broadcast_like for mx.np.ndarray\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nbtw, it is motivated by #17584 \r\n@sxjscience

Description ##\r\nThe Embedding op was previously breaking on large tensor (dimension >= 2^32) data. With the following input:\r\n```\r\nnd.Embedding(data=nd.random_normal(shape=(2**32,1)), weight=nd.random_normal(shape=(2**32,1)), input_dim=2**32, output_dim=1)\r\n```\r\nthe following error was thrown:\r\n```\r\nmxnet.base.MXNetError: MXNetError: Invalid Parameter format for input_dim expect int but value='4294967296', in operator Embedding(name=\"\", output_dim=\"1\", input_dim=\"4294967296\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, I modified `indexing_op.h` to switch from storing input_dim as an `int` to storing it as an `index_t`. After implementing my fix and rebuilding, the previous input command displayed the correct output:\r\n```\r\n[[[-0.5190417]]\r\n\r\n [[-1.4388928]]\r\n\r\n [[ 1.1367434]]\r\n\r\n ...\r\n\r\n [[-1.4388928]]\r\n\r\n [[-1.4388928]]\r\n\r\n [[-0.5190417]]]\r\n<NDArray 4294967296x1x1 @cpu(0)>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- M src/operator/tensor/indexing_op.h\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTested on r5dn.24xl-ubuntu 16.04 and p2.16xl-ubuntu 16.04 with\r\n1.

Description ##\r\nRight now with #17465 if a CI Jenkins build fails, we print the stacktrace using `error.printStackTrace()` function\r\n\r\nI found that \r\na. According to Jenkins Script Security, It is an insecure function that needs to be approved by administrators in Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> In-process Script approval\r\nWithout the approval it gives SandBox error\r\n```\r\norg.jenkinsci.plugins.scriptsecurity.sandbox.RejectedAccessException: Scripts not permitted to use method java.lang.Throwable getStackTrace\r\n```\r\nThis was probably the reason why status of few PR runs (despite success/fail on Jenkins) wasn't reported back to Github. Someone from the admin team likely approved it so as to allow the function to not error out.\r\n\r\nb. However, the `error.printStackTrace()` function sends the report to System.err\r\nIt doesn't get printed on the console.\r\nTo print on console, it has to be passed as a parameter.\r\nVerified it works by adding a failure case in the try (so as to enter the \"catch\")\r\n```\r\ntry {\r\n    update_github_commit_status('PENDING', 'Job has been enqueued')\r\n    System.out.println(12 / 0)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt enters catch and then prints the stack trace for divide by zero exception as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nRead more about Jenkins Script Security : https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security/\r\n\r\nHow to handle printStackTrace - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12095378/difference-between-e-printstacktrace-and-system-out-printlne","created_at":"2020-02-14T22:06:14Z","updated_at":"2020-10-02T16:55:18Z","closed_at":"2020-03-08T12:11:42Z","merged_at":"2020-03-08T12:11:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"1bd0a08419c10f9dea17c5657de4f0baaed1b2dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR is waiting for code review"},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nAdd cmake build support for macOS static build.\r\nAdded --without-libidn2 flag for libcurl build.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- CMake build still fail with libtiff 4.0.10 version. macOS build only work with 4.0.9, will create separate PR.\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-14T03:27:42Z","updated_at":"2020-02-17T18:27:10Z","closed_at":"2020-02-17T18:27:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"220740e8cf0a5f067b45ac99265c39ea135e3a4e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17592/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17592/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17592/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/6c14a7b5a10a72cd7e94eac36980b1e2f213be5e","head":{"label":"frankfliu:master","ref":"master","sha":"6c14a7b5a10a72cd7e94eac36980b1e2f213be5e","user":{"login":"frankfliu","id":24425551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDI1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24425551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu","html_url":"https://github.com/frankfliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":140871682,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDA4NzE2ODI=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"frankfliu/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"frankfliu","id":24425551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDI1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24425551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu","html_url":"https://github.com/frankfliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankfliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/frankfliu/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nAdd a brief tutorial doc on Custom partitioning tutorial and example for the feature implemented in #15969. This PR addresses two of the items in #17532\r\n- Adds an example using Gluon to partition a model\r\n- Adds fixes to custom operator support for the backward pass of subgraphOps\r\n- changes int* and size to vector<int> for `ids` in `acceptSubgraph` API\r\n\r\n## This PR is not\r\n- Updating docs on the MXNet website on extending MXNet\r\n- Consolidating custom extension related docs on the website\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Renamed `backend_args` to `backend_opts` for the `hybridize` API to disambiguate from model args (ie. params) since it contains options that are passed to the backend.\r\n- Moved GPU customOp tests and split tests into diff files for CPU and GPU\r\n  - CPU tests are in **unittests/test_extensions.py** for test_custom_op (GeMM) and test_subgraph (exp, log)\r\n  - GPU tests are in **gpu/test_extensions_gpu.py** for test_custom_op_gpu (ReLU)\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-13T07:53:26Z","updated_at":"2020-02-20T22:55:32Z","closed_at":"2020-02-20T18:23:10Z","merged_at":"2020-02-20T18:23:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"4668fbd9ddb5d48530a776ef8262e2a234959844","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nBuild from source only works with JDK < 9 due to dependency on\r\nmaven-compiler-plugin and `make ratcheck` is thus broken on newer systems.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nAnother thing I noticed is that on CI, some `.md` files are wrongly detected as binary files and excluded from license checking.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBinary files (which do not require any license headers) will be marked

running locally with openjdk 11.0.6 2020-01-14, these files get correctly marked as \"missing license\". As I'm using the same `apache-rat-0.13.jar` locally, this discrepancy may be due to difference in Java version.\r\n\r\n@roywei @szha

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-12T16:12:37Z","updated_at":"2020-02-15T03:20:34Z","closed_at":"2020-02-15T01:19:20Z","merged_at":"2020-02-15T01:19:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"40c0c5452ffd6a1168ab78f0847331145e6710bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17576/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17576/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17576/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/a46d0b6e54e20ae2099b029ebcf8fa7c3457f9e6","head":{"label":"TaoLv:softmax-stype","ref":"softmax-stype","sha":"a46d0b6e54e20ae2099b029ebcf8fa7c3457f9e6","user":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113452572,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTM0NTI1NzI=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"TaoLv/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nHere, I fix the ordering issue when operator perf results are generated with the native profiler. Previously, the ordering of keys in the output dict generated was arbitrary and illogical. There were cases where `avg_time_forward_` perf results were displayed after `avg_time_backward_` perf results (when running with `opperf.py`), and where memory consumption was displayed between forward and backward perf results (when running categories of operators individually). Furthermore, `inputs` were never displayed first in the output.  \r\n\r\nTo solve these problems, I traced the construction of the results dictionary back to the saving of forward/backward perf results and memory consumption data in `profiler_utils.py`. I found that the entry for `avg_time_backward_` was consistently being added to the dictionary before the entry for `avg_time_forward_` (since it appeared first in the raw profile results, and was consequently encountered first in the iteration). I implemented a fix that saved each result to a variable during the iteration, and added the variable values to the dict in the correct order after the iteration had finished. \r\n\r\nAfter making this change, I found another issue: `merge_map_list()` constructed the output map in a way that was insensitive to the order of the list of dictionaries (and the keys within those dictionaries) that it was passed. I rewrote `merge_map_list()` to be sensitive to the order of its input list, as wells as the order of the keys within the dictionaries of each list element. Then, in `benchmark_utils.py`, I passed the `input` map to `merge_map_list()` before the other entries to ensure its position as the first key in the resulting dictionary.\r\n\r\nEven after making these changes, I found that the output of `opperf.py` was still ordered incorrectly. I found the root cause of the issue: in the `json.dump` call in `common_utils.py`, the `sort_keys` parameter was set to `True`, which would sort the keys of all dictionaries in the output JSON alphabetically (overwriting my ordering of the output dictionary). I saw that the purpose of sorting the output dictionary was to display the operator keys alphabetically in the resulting JSON. To retain this alphabetical operator sorting while preserving the ordering I had established for the output of each operator, I disabled the `sort_keys` parameter and sorted only the highest-level keys in the final output map in `opperf.py`.\r\n\r\nWhen I finished making these changes, I wanted to quickly test them with `opperf.py`, but found that there was no way to specify `warmup` and `runs` from the command line when calling opperf. I thought this would be a very useful feature for users testing operator performance, so I added it.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/opperf.py\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/utils/benchmark_utils.py\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/utils/common_utils.py\r\n- M benchmark/opperf/utils/profiler_utils.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTested on Mac OS and Ubuntu 16.04 (on p2.16xl) with:\r\n1.

Description ##\r\nAdd support for sparse custom operators. It will support row sparse and CSR formats.\r\nThis is a continuation of custom operators project, initial CPU support is implemented here: #15921 and GPU support is implemented here: #17270 .\r\n\r\n- Added the MXSparse structure. The data_ptr of MXTensor points to an object of this structure for sparse tensors and point to data for dense tensors. \r\n- Added data storage type enum for MXTensor. It supports dense, row sparse and CSR formats.\r\n- Added alloc_sparse() function within OpResource which fixed the sparse output size issue at run time.\r\n- Added inferSType() function which enables customized storage type inference implementation.\r\n- Created new example libraries in \"example/extensions/lib_custom_op\"  for CSR and row sparse tensor transpose operators.\r\n\r\n## Design ##\r\nThe function alloc_sparse() in lower level call function CheckAndAlloc(). To call this member function of NDArray, we added lambda functions just as what we did for alloc_cpu().\r\n```\r\nauto sparse_alloc = [&](int index, int indices_len, int idxptr_len,\r\n                      void** data, int64_t** indices, int64_t** indptr) {\r\n  // Row Sparse\r\n  if(idxptr_len == 0) {\r\n    outputs[index].CheckAndAlloc({mshadow::Shape1(indices_len)});\r\n    *data = outputs[index].data().dptr_;\r\n    *indices = (int64_t*)outputs[index].aux_data(rowsparse::kIdx).dptr_;\r\n  }\r\n  // CSR\r\n  else {\r\n    outputs[index].CheckAndAlloc({mshadow::Shape1(idxptr_len), mshadow::Shape1(indices_len)});\r\n    *data = outputs[index].data().dptr_;\r\n    *indices = (int64_t*)outputs[index].aux_data(csr::kIdx).dptr_;\r\n    *indptr = (int64_t*)outputs[index].aux_data(csr::kIndPtr).dptr_;\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n```\r\ntypedef decltype(sparse_alloc) alloc_type_sparse;\r\nauto sparse_malloc = [](void* _sparse_alloc, int index, int indices_len, int idxptr_len,\r\n                       void** data, int64_t** indices, int64_t** indptr) {\r\n  alloc_type_sparse* sparsealloc = static_cast<alloc_type_sparse*>(_sparse_alloc);\r\n  (*sparsealloc)(index, indices_len, idxptr_len, data, indices, indptr);\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThe lambda function could be called by alloc_sparse() within OpResource.\r\n```\r\nvoid alloc_sparse(MXSparse* sparse, int index, int indices_len, int indptr_len = 0) {\r\n  sparse_malloc(sparse_alloc, index, indices_len, indptr_len,\r\n               &(sparse->data), &(sparse->indices), &(sparse->indptr));\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn the customized implementation, users are able to set output tensor size

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis PR can help us **start a discussion** on how to integrate the functions required for Binary Neural Networks (BNN) models into mxnet based on our code in BMXNet 2 ( https://github.com/hpi-xnor/BMXNet-v2 ). It should definitely not be merged in its current state.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nWe added three functions `det_sign` ([ada4ea1d](https://github.com/hpi-xnor/BMXNet-v2/commit/ada4ea1d4418cfdd6cbc6d0159e1a716cb01cd85)), `round_ste` ([044f81f0](https://github.com/hpi-xnor/BMXNet-v2/commit/044f81f028887b9842070df28b28de394bd07516)) and `contrib.gradcancel` to MXNet (see [src/operator/contrib/gradient_cancel[-inl.h|.cc|.cu]](src/operator/contrib)). - _The `gradcancel` operator is needed for training a BNN only, however it currently is also part of the binary layers._\r\n\r\nThe rest of the changes was made in the following folders/files:\r\n- Examples are in a submodule in [example/bmxnet-examples](https://github.com/hpi-xnor/BMXNet-v2-examples) - _might reside in a binary model zoo instead_\r\n- Tests are in [tests/binary](tests/binary) - _we run our tests with `pytest`, so a conversion (and possibly integration into the existing test files) of these to `nosetests` should be made_\r\n- Layers are in [python/mxnet/gluon/nn/binary_layers.py](python/mxnet/gluon/nn/binary_layers.py) - _needed for inference and training_\r\n- Converter is in

Description ##\r\nThis pull request adds wrappers to the intgemm matrix multiplication library: https://github.com/kpu/intgemm .  \r\n\r\nA performance comparison with DNNL aka MKL-DNN is at https://github.com/kpu/intgemm/issues/59\r\n\r\nThe library targets thin matrix sizes seen in neural machine translation inference and was part of the top submission to the 2018 Workshop on Neural Generation and Translation efficiency task:  https://neural.mt/papers/edinburgh/wnmt_marian_paper.pdf .  The purpose of this issue is to add similar functionality to Sockeye: https://github.com/awslabs/sockeye/pull/771 . \r\n\r\nQuantized Sockeye performance is 2.95x as fast.  One problem with the current MXQuantizeSymbol approach is that Sockeye does not have a static graph for everything.\r\n\r\nintgemm uses a custom memory layout for the weight matrix to make more memory accesses consecutive, so there are operators to convert weights to that format.  The idea is that weights are typically loaded once for inference. \r\n\r\nOn architectures without VNNI, intgemm uses saturating 16-bit accumulation. This avoids an expensive madd_epi16 instruction every multiply by exploiting the fact that most neural network parameters are near 0.\r\n\r\nBecause x86 only offers a unsigned * signed instruction and most people want signed * signed, there are two strategies one can take. \r\n\r\n    Add 128 to data so now it's unsigned.  But that biases the output.  DNNL calculates this bias on the fly by summing weights then subtracts it out during GEMM.  intgemm calculates this bias in advance, which can then be subtracted from the bias term with no overhead at runtime.  A problem with this strategy is that it makes the accumulator bigger, requiring more upcasting with an expensive madd_epi16 instruction. \r\n    Emulate signed * signed by normalizing the sign bit into the second argument. This requires extra instructions in the hot loop but keeps the accumulator small, so it's less necessary to accumulate into 32-bit integers and madd_epi16 can be avoided. \r\n\r\nBoth intgemm and DNNL implement strategy 1; intgemm also implements strategy 2. \r\n\r\nSimilar to DNNL, intgemm has runtime CPUID selection among backends for SSSE3, AVX2, AVX512BW, and AVX512VNNI. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR).\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] submodule for intgemm\r\n- [x] `intgemm_prepare_data` and `intgemm_prepare_weight` operators to convert operands from fp32\r\n- [x] `intgemm_take_weight` for taking weights in intgemm's weight format, which is useful for vocabulary shortlists in Sockeye.  \r\n- [x] `intgemm_fully_connected` for matrix multiply\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nBackward compatible.\r\nintgemm requires the inner dimension be a multiple of 64 for efficiency and alignment reasons.  Currently the outputs must be a multiple of 8 but there is in-progress code in intgemm to remove that.

Description ##\r\nAdd an new type of KVStore: Byteps KVstore. \r\nAs proposed in  [#16795](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16795) \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nThe nightly test has passed. Some unit test is on the way.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and

(i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/15662\r\nThis will replace #16532 with an alternative solution.\r\nPlease refer to the discussion in  https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/16532#discussion_r339268855\r\n\r\n1. Added `GetSeed()` in GPU random resource, it's similar to CPU version.\r\n2. During cudnn dropout, check whether random seed has been changed and reset cudnn dropout descriptor's seed if random seed changed.\r\n\r\nBenefit:\r\n1. This avoided generating a random int (tensor on gpu) on GPU, copy to CPU and and pass it to `cudnnDropoutGetStatesSize`.\r\n2. get the seed from gpu random resource is fast, we can afford to do it every forward.\r\n\r\nDrawback:\r\nWill be affected by https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/7410, by default mxnet's random seed is fixed.\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-07T20:17:30Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T17:07:51Z","closed_at":"2020-04-10T17:51:22Z","merged_at":"2020-04-10T17:51:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"249b9a13002cf0ee1d3d530e31b69b15aae433bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ptrendx","id":8398980,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTg5ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8398980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx","html_url":"https://github.com/ptrendx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"DickJC123","id":1703397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123","html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17547/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17547/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17547/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/b8efb3d2d0ca9c13a6d95ee983192bff3b782874","head":{"label":"roywei:dropout","ref":"dropout","sha":"b8efb3d2d0ca9c13a6d95ee983192bff3b782874","user":{"login":"roywei","id":8022184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjIxODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8022184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei","html_url":"https://github.com/roywei","followers_url":"https://api.github.c
