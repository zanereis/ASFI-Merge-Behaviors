I don't have a lot of time to write this PR, I'll add more details when I get the chance.*\r\n\r\nMy team has been experiencing issues when we use the default `JdbcIO.write()` in our streaming pipelines. The main problem is the large amount of connections being opened over time.\r\n\r\nI had a look at the support for pooling and noticed that the object pool is configured to only hold one connection per worker. We've tried that in the past (without the Jdbc SDK) and ended up with a very bad bottleneck. Of course increasing the number of connections available won't solve all our problems, but having a finer grained control over the pool being used would at least allow some experimentation.\r\n\r\nAll this change does is factor out the default pool construction to a factory, set by default to the one in current use.\r\n\r\nFor now I'm submitting this for review and thoughts from other contributors/maintainers to see if this is headed in the wrong direction. I can work around this in the time by manually delegating to a connection pool, but I'll be missing all the other great features the SDK provides (batching, connection management per-bundle, ...).\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think, I'll get back to you asap! :)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds the Windows configuration to the existing mechanism that generates python wheels using Github Actions.\r\nAs the POSIX functions `usleep` and `clock_gettime` are not present on the Windows platform, alternative versions have to be implemented using native API. The conditional compilation (depending on the platform) is introduced to choose the correct implementation.\r\n\r\nOn Windows XP and later the implementation of `clock_gettime` is guaranteed to have a resolution higher than 1µs. The real resolution of the `usleep` seems to be around tens of µs on my machine. That's about two orders of magnitude worse than posix version on my ubuntu, but that's probably related to the OS scheduler. Anyway, that shouldn't be an issue in the current usage of the function.\r\n\r\nCredits for @TobKed for the Github actions configuration. I've only helped with the proper cythonization on Windows.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Go SDK uses errors returned by DoFns to signal failures to process bundles, and terminate bundle processing. However, if the preceding DoFn uses emitters, rather than error returns, the code has no choice to panic to avoid user code handling or ignoring the cross DoFn error (which could cause dataloss or other correctness problems).\r\n\r\nAll bundle executions are wrapped in `callNoPanic` to prevent worker termination on such panics, and orderly terminate just the affected bundle instead.`callNoPanic` uses Go's built in recover mechanism to get the error and provide a stack trace.\r\n\r\nThis is message is not necessarily helpful to the user and can lead to degraded user experience when debugging such errors.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, we introduce a new type of error; a `doFnError` which has a more concise representation of the DoFn which failed, the error which the DoFn failed with and other meta information.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

goal of these changes is to make the process of creating and modifying Grafana dashboards easier by populating InfluxDB database with real data.\r\n\r\nTwo workflows have been implemented:\r\n* a cronjob that makes a full backup of InfluxDB and sends it to a public GCS bucket. The bucket has object versioning[1] enabled. It also has a lifecycle rule[2] that keeps only the 14 most recent versions of the backup.\r\n* a docker-compose service that starts just after InfluxDB, downloads the latest version of the backup and restore its content.\r\n\r\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning\r\n[2] https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/lifecycle\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

support for changing the null read behavior of JsonToRow using the changes done in RowJson. \r\n\r\nAdded NullBehavior to JsonToRow, and some corresponding tests. \r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI needed to add the volatile flag on the NullBehavior on JsonToRowFn because spotbugs would complain about threading issues if I didn't. \r\n\r\nDidn't end up doing anything with the BeamSQL Json stuff as I don't have any experience with BeamSQL and looked like quite a lot of internal code surrounding it. \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

problems:\r\n1. For now the python transforms are very limited as RowCoder is yet to be upgraded:\r\n- Write can accept only primitive types without boolean, bytes\r\n- Read can accept even more limited types because LogicalTypes are not implemented in python\r\n2. Write transform uses JdbcIO.write() - it would be better to use writeRows() with automated Row coder when it's implemented.\r\n\r\nIn general coders need to be upgraded before these transforms are usable.\r\n\r\nR: @TheNeuralBit \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

row encoder and decoder function generators, using reflection.

@rose-rong-liu @katsiapis\r\n\r\nI would like to move Shared from (https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx-bsl/blob/master/tfx_bsl/beam/shared.py) to Beam, since it is probably generally useful for other Beam users. Does this move sounds reasonable to you?\r\n\r\nThe change is mostly a copy paste, change to copyright headers, unittest framework, and typehints.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

bytes, bool, and iterable coders to the graph/coders package.\r\n\r\nThis is in preparation of the next PR which has the first pass at the row encoder, so these building blocks can be reviewed separately. \r\nThe bool and bytes coders are code migrated from the exec package, but it was striking me as odd to have so much encoding implementation living in exec/coder.go when much of it was in this graph/coder package. Those implementations will be replaced with the ones in this PR as appropriate (eg. iterables will necessarily be implemented in the Datasource package as well to support Large CoGBKs via the state channel for example.)\r\n\r\nIterables demonstrate how to handle reflective encoding with nested types, in this case, with a nested coder. As much as possible, it's best to avoid swapping back and forth through reflect.Values as that adds extensive overhead, which is why these are implemented in terms of reflect.Value. This doesn't matter for the primitive types which have efficient extraction methods from the reflect.Value containers.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

apache/beam#12079\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt turns out that on direct runner, NULL will not be passed to CombineFn thus all NULL inputs are ignored. And then if there is any non-null inputs, bit_and will be applied on them only, which leads to a non-null result, which is not correct.\r\n\r\nBefore we can figure out the root cause and propose a fix, we should revert this implementation.

#11761 was merged it, it appears that one of the related task files `task.md` for the 'Introduction' section of the Beam Katas for Java was moved as opposed to being copied over. This has caused issues when building the Java Katas and has been widely regarded as a bad move. \r\n\r\nThis PR should address this issue. I've reviewed the previous pull request for any additional moved files, and it appears that this was the only missing one.\r\n\r\nCC: @henryken \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
