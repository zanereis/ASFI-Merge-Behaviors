the original code, if there was an error doing the long poll, it would wait 100ms and then try again. If it errors again, it doubles to 200ms. If it errors again, it doubles again etc. with no cap. \n\nThis means after 10 errors in a row, you will be in a position of waiting a minute and a half before it attempts to reconnect. After that, 3 minutes and then it frankly spirals out of control!\n\nThat means if you lose internet connectivity (entirely possible if your wireless/3g is flakey) - you will very quickly, essentially lose your polling abilities.\n\nMy suggestion is to put a cap on this timeout - I've simply added in a conditional so that it will never go above 5 seconds. In my own use case, I'm actually going to keep it at 100ms and not multiply, so it might be worth having this as an option instead of hard coded.\n","created_at":"2013-05-17T11:17:44Z","updated_at":"2017-03-19T17:45:51Z","closed_at":"2017-03-19T17:45:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4dab90ef1cec9985ac37b992df42915103917256","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/60/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/60/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/60/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/c41856aab25ce4ba621b69460d026b73e75f8d6b","head":{"label":"andrewspode:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"c41856aab25ce4ba621b69460d026b73e75f8d6b","user":{"login":"andrewspode","id":3798527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTg1Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3798527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewspode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c8bbd093415618fe40bd197101f4a0b8defb3e24","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

pull request implements the ability of using functions for rewriting in addition to the rewriting microlanguage that is currently available. The motivation for doing so comes from a discussion on the users' list in which it turned out that I wasn't the only one who found the microlanguage limited (the latter still works just the same though).\n\nIt uses the same \"rewrites\" ddoc key so that you can't have both. I think that this is a feature: specifying both and having to figure out which takes precedence would be excessive complication IMHO. And it's of course possible to have the function implement the microlanguage if for some reason one wishes to use both simultaneously.\n\nI've provided some docs in the comments — if the patch is accepted and those need to be mirrored (and expanded) somewhere else, simply tell me where is the preferred location. I've also written some tests; I guess that there could be more but it seems clear that it works and doesn't break existing rewrites.\n\nThe only change that it makes to the current HTTP interface is that previously if you added a ddoc with a string as the value for \"rewrites\" you'd get a 400. Now, if that strings is a valid function is just works, and if it's not you get a 500. I doubt that this will break anything.\n\nSome caveats:\n\n• This is essentially my Hello World to Erlang. It's not out of the question that I've written something that looks terrifyingly stupid or woefully more convoluted than it needs to be.\n\n• I've tried to follow the coding conventions that I noticed, apologies if I messed it up here or there.\n\n• The rewrite functions are meant to be cacheable at least for the lifetime of a given ddoc but I haven't added such caching. I don't know how much it would affect performance (though I would expect some). I also don't know whether it should vary on userCtx or not. Either way, I think that it's an optimisation that can be added

folder asynchronously after it has been renamed.\n\nThe second commit reuses the nuke_dir_sync() function to clean up the .delete folder on startup because it can now contain deleted

patch adds the X-Couch-Id and X-Couch-Rev headers to responses, so that a custom default_handler can act on DB changes (e.g. create tasks).\n\nWe have a custom default_handler that creates Celery tasks via a Python process. It wraps the couch_httpd_d:handle_request/1 function, looks at the response, then creates some tasks. What it needs is the document Id and Rev for each PUT/POST/DELETE request, but those are not available from the Response on that level (the response body is sent to the socket inside the black box somewhere). The headers are available. So we decided to add the Id and Rev to the JSON responses and also the update function as X-Couch-Id and X-Couch-Rev. When using an update function, the rev is available though \"X-Couch-Update-NewRev\", so only the Id has been added.\n\nWe have a large amount of small databases (potentially thousands), so it is not practical to listen to changes on every DB.  \n\nIf there is another recommendation to achieve this without patching, please suggest an alternative.\n","created_at":"2012-09-21T08:58:49Z","updated_at":"2014-07-07T00:10:33Z","closed_at":"2012-11-02T14:02:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d857971dc9bc681e80294f7eba91320660f2af97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/32/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/32/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/32/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/a1f224ea46d4919b3dba5ebc40c5bea0e5fc0100","head":{"label":"bjnortier:id_and_rev_in_response_headers","ref":"id_and_rev_in_response_headers","sha":"a1f224ea46d4919b3dba5ebc40c5bea0e5fc0100","user":{"login":"bjnortier","id":57994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3OTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier","html_url":"https://github.com/bjnortier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5762551,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NzYyNTUx","name":"couchdb","full_name":"bjnortier/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bjnortier","id":57994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3OTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier","html_url":"https://github.com/bjnortier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjnortier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bjnortier/couchdb","description":"Mirror

thought I'd follow the rough spirit of the proposed merge process for this pull request. I'm unsure whether I should be making a pull request now, or continuing discussion on the JIRA ticket. Please let me know if I'm doing the wrong thing.\n\nI'd like to propose this code to be tested and merged into the master branch.\n\nThe associated JIRA ticket is:\n\n  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-1373\n\n[X] The branch includes tests. JavaScript and etap tests are included.\n[X] The branch includes docs. default.ini.tpl.in documents the new utc_id_suffix algorithm.\n[X] `make distcheck` has not been tested. I don't have all the pieces needed for this, so am hoping one of the dev team can do this final step and let me know if there are any errors.\n\nNote that the algorithm is as proposed in the existing patches attached to the JIRA issue, with some extra tests. There was a proposal to use the MAC address, but the possible difficulties with Solaris, and Bob Dionne's final JIRA comment led me to leave it out.\n\nThanks for your consideration\n\nNick

calls to getRow() cause the HTTP headers to be sent immediately back\nto the client. This happens even if an error is thrown after the getRow(), but\nbefore any send(...) or start(...). Worse, if a list throws an exception an\nextra, invalid header is sent to the client (resulting in various bad\nbehavior).\n\nErlang list handling will now wait until data has been sent BEFORE sending the\nHTTP headers to the client. If an error is reported it will result in an HTTP\nerror code as expected. This does not change the behavior of errors thrown\nAFTER data has been sent: They will still result in an HTTP 200 even if an\nerror is reported.\n\nThe line protocol between Erlang and os processes has been extended to support\nan optional Header field on \"chunks\" and \"end\". The javascript list handling\nhas been updated to use this if a new header is set via start(...). This makes\nit possible to begin processing with getRow(), but later reset the headers via\nstart(...).
