change does a more thorough redaction of sensitive information from logs and UI\r\nAdd unit tests that ensure that no regressions happen that leak sensitive information to the logs.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this change was appearance of password like so in `SparkListenerEnvironmentUpdate` in event logs under some JVM configurations:\r\n`\"sun.java.command\":\"org.apache.spark.deploy.SparkSubmit ... --conf spark.executorEnv.HADOOP_CREDSTORE_PASSWORD=secret_password ...\"\r\n`\r\nPreviously redaction logic was only checking if the key matched the secret regex pattern, it'd redact it's value. That worked for most cases. However, in the above case, the key (sun.java.command) doesn't tell much, so the value needs to be searched. This PR expands the check to check for values as well.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests added that ensure that no sensitive information is present in the event logs or the yarn logs. Old unit test in UtilsSuite was modified because the test was asserting that a non-sensitive property's value won't be redacted. However, the non-sensitive value had the literal \"secret\" in it which was causing it to redact. Simply updating the non-sensitive property's value to another arbitrary value (that didn't have \"secret\" in it) fixed

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMove Hadoop delegation token code from `spark-yarn` to `spark-core`, so that other schedulers (such as Mesos), may use it.  In order to avoid exposing Hadoop interfaces in spark-core, the new Hadoop delegation token classes are kept private.  In order to provider backward compatiblity, and to allow YARN users to continue to load their own delegation token providers via Java service loading, the old YARN interfaces, as well as the client code that uses them, have been retained.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n- Move registered `yarn.security.ServiceCredentialProvider` classes from `spark-yarn` to `spark-core`.  Moved them into a new, private hierarchy under `HadoopDelegationTokenProvider`.  Client code in `HadoopDelegationTokenManager` now loads credentials from a whitelist of three providers (`HadoopFSDelegationTokenProvider`, `HiveDelegationTokenProvider`, `HBaseDelegationTokenProvider`), instead of service loading, which means that users are not able to implement their own delegation token providers, as they are in the `spark-yarn` module.\r\n\r\n- The `yarn.security.ServiceCredentialProvider` interface has been kept for backwards compatibility, and to continue to allow YARN users to implement their own delegation token provider implementations.  Client code in YARN now fetches tokens via the new `YARNHadoopDelegationTokenManager` class, which fetches tokens from the core providers through `HadoopDelegationTokenManager`, as well as service loads them from `yarn.security.ServiceCredentialProvider`. \r\n\r\n\r\nOld Hierarchy:\r\n\r\n```\r\nyarn.security.ServiceCredentialProvider (service loaded)\r\n  HadoopFSCredentialProvider\r\n  HiveCredentialProvider\r\n  HBaseCredentialProvider\r\nyarn.security.ConfigurableCredentialManager\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew Hierarchy:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHadoopDelegationTokenManager\r\nHadoopDelegationTokenProvider (not service loaded)\r\n  HadoopFSDelegationTokenProvider\r\n  HiveDelegationTokenProvider\r\n  HBaseDelegationTokenProvider\r\n\r\nyarn.security.ServiceCredentialProvider (service loaded)\r\nyarn.security.YARNHadoopDelegationTokenManager\r\n```\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nunit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nmerge renameTable to alterTable in ExternalCatalog has some reasons:\r\n\r\nIn Hive, we rename a Table by alterTable\r\nCurrently when we create / rename a managed table, we should get the defaultTablePath for them in ExternalCatalog, then we have two defaultTablePath logic in its two subclass HiveExternalCatalog and InMemoryCatalog, additionally there is also a defaultTablePath in SessionCatalog, so till now we have three defaultTablePath in three classes.\r\nwe'd better to unify them up to SessionCatalog\r\nTo unify them, we should move some logic from ExternalCatalog to SessionCatalog, renameTable is one of this.\r\n\r\nwhile limit to the simple parameters in renameTable\r\n```\r\n  def renameTable(db: String, oldName: String, newName: String): Unit\r\n```\r\neven if we move the defaultTablePath logic to SessionCatalog, we can not pass it to renameTable.\r\n\r\nSo we can merge the renameTable to alterTable, and rename it in alterTable.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\ndelete some tests in ExternalCatalogSuite which already existed in SessionCatalogSuite,\r\nand move some other tests in ExternalCatalogSuite which does not exist in SessionCatalogSuite","created_at":"2017-04-21T14:58:30Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T12:17:04Z","closed_at":"2017-06-27T12:17:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17721/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17721/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17721/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2ea645c6efef36ad2833d8eced0150d4062b1efd","head":{"label":"windpiger:mergeAlterRenameTable","ref":"mergeAlterRenameTable","sha":"2ea645c6efef36ad2833d8eced0150d4062b1efd","user":{"login":"windpiger","id":12979185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc5MTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12979185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger","html_url":"https://github.com/windpiger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70575274,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDU3NTI3NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"windpiger/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"windpiger","id":12979185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc5MTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12979185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger","html_url":"https://github.com/windpiger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/windpiger/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe currently have quite a few analysis exception subclasses, the problem with these is that they are not well supported throughout Spark (in pySpark for example) and that the added value is limited. This PR removes the `no such object` and the `already exists` exceptions, and replaces them by a factory methods that create analysis exceptions with the required error messages.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nModified existing tests.","created_at":"2017-04-21T10:43:27Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T12:17:04Z","closed_at":"2017-06-27T12:17:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1b9270cdc05aa0251841c48dc8a03b7284420511","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17716/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17716/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17716/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/79ee4a6603e48e8a755afadfe714d87f15dacac3","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-19952","ref":"SPARK-19952","sha":"79ee4a6603e48e8a755afadfe714d87f15dacac3","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMLlib ```LogisticRegression``` should support bound constrained optimization (only for L2 regularization). Users can add bound constraints to coefficients to make the solver produce solution in the specified range.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, we call Breeze [```L-BFGS-B```](https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze/blob/master/math/src/main/scala/breeze/optimize/LBFGSB.scala) as the solver for bound constrained optimization. But in the current breeze implementation, there are some bugs in L-BFGS-B, and https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze/pull/633 fixed them. We need to upgrade dependent breeze later, and currently we use the workaround L-BFGS-B in this PR temporary for reviewing.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIt is often useful to be able to track changes to the `ExternalCatalog`. This PR makes the `ExternalCatalog` emit events when a catalog object is changed. Events are fired before and after the change.\r\n\r\nThe following events are fired per object:\r\n\r\n- Database\r\n  - CreateDatabasePreEvent: event fired before the database is created.\r\n  - CreateDatabaseEvent: event fired after the database has been created.\r\n  - DropDatabasePreEvent: event fired before the database is dropped.\r\n  - DropDatabaseEvent: event fired after the database has been dropped.\r\n- Table\r\n  - CreateTablePreEvent: event fired before the table is created.\r\n  - CreateTableEvent: event fired after the table has been created.\r\n  - RenameTablePreEvent: event fired before the table is renamed.\r\n  - RenameTableEvent: event fired after the table has been renamed.\r\n  - DropTablePreEvent: event fired before the table is dropped.\r\n  - DropTableEvent: event fired after the table has been dropped.\r\n- Function\r\n  - CreateFunctionPreEvent: event fired before the function is created.\r\n  - CreateFunctionEvent: event fired after the function has been created.\r\n  - RenameFunctionPreEvent: event fired before the function is renamed.\r\n  - RenameFunctionEvent: event fired after the function has been renamed.\r\n  - DropFunctionPreEvent: event fired before the function is dropped.\r\n  - DropFunctionPreEvent: event fired after the function has been dropped.\r\n\r\nThe current events currently only contain the names of the object modified. We add more events, and more details at a later point.\r\n\r\nA user can monitor changes to the external catalog by adding a listener to the Spark listener bus checking for `ExternalCatalogEvent`s using the `SparkListener.onOtherEvent` hook. A more direct approach is add listener directly to the `ExternalCatalog`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen reg == 0, MLOR has multiple solutions and we need to centralize the coeffs to get identical result.\r\nBUT current implementation centralize the `coefficientMatrix` by the global coeffs means.\r\n\r\nIn fact the `coefficientMatrix` should be centralized on each feature index itself.\r\nBecause, according to the MLOR probability distribution function, it can be proven easily that:\r\nsuppose `{ w0, w1, .. w(K-1) }` make up the `coefficientMatrix`,\r\nthen `{ w0 + c, w1 + c, ... w(K - 1) + c}` will also be the equivalent solution.\r\n`c` is an arbitrary vector of `numFeatures` dimension.\r\nreference\r\nhttps://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6287975.pdf\r\n\r\nSo that we need to centralize the `coefficientMatrix` on each feature dimension separately.\r\n\r\n**We can also confirm this through R library `glmnet`, that MLOR in `glmnet` always generate coefficients result that the sum of each dimension is all `zero`, when reg == 0.**\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTests added.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-20T14:27:59Z","updated_at":"2017-04-22T01:44:48Z","closed_at":"2017-04-21T18:01:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d9b0305294521a71ffd3ef057170e429aa5811d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17706/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17706/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17706/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a694d13095a37c8fbcdea2ed51ca01569f4ef6af","head":{"label":"WeichenXu123:mlor_center","ref":"mlor_center","sha":"a694d13095a37c8fbcdea2ed51ca01569f4ef6af","user":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58255485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODI1NTQ4NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"WeichenXu123/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR avoids an exception in the case where `scala.math.BigInt` has a value that does not fit into long value range (e.g. `Long.MAX_VALUE+1`).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, if there are dots in the column name, predicate pushdown seems being failed in Parquet.\r\n\r\n**With dots**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval path = \"/tmp/abcde\"\r\nSeq(Some(1), None).toDF(\"col.dots\").write.parquet(path)\r\nspark.read.parquet(path).where(\"`col.dots` IS NOT NULL\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+--------+\r\n|col.dots|\r\n+--------+\r\n+--------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Without dots**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval path = \"/tmp/abcde\"\r\nSeq(Some(1), None).toDF(\"coldots\").write.parquet(path)\r\nspark.read.parquet(path).where(\"`coldots` IS NOT NULL\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-------+\r\n|coldots|\r\n+-------+\r\n|      1|\r\n+-------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems dot in the column names via `FilterApi` tries to separate the field name with dot (`ColumnPath` with multiple column paths) whereas the actual column name is `col.dots`. (See [FilterApi.java#L71](https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/blob/apache-parquet-1.8.2/parquet-column/src/main/java/org/apache/parquet/filter2/predicate/FilterApi.java#L71) and it calls [ColumnPath.java#L44](https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/blob/apache-parquet-1.8.2/parquet-common/src/main/java/org/apache/parquet/hadoop/metadata/ColumnPath.java#L44)).\r\n\r\nI just tried to come up with ways to resolve it and I came up with two as below (as I could not find \r\n a way to set dots as are):\r\n\r\n - One is simply to don't push down filters when there are dots in column names so that it reads all and filters in Spark-side.\r\n\r\n - The other way creates Spark's `FilterApi` for those columns (it seems final) to get always use single column path it in Spark-side (this seems hacky) as we are not pushing down nested columns currently. So, it looks we can get a field name via `ColumnPath.get` not `ColumnPath.fromDotString` in this way.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the latter way because I think we need to be sure on that it passes the tests.\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval path = \"/tmp/abcde\"\r\nSeq(Some(1), None).toDF(\"col.dots\").write.parquet(path)\r\nspark.read.parquet(path).where(\"`col.dots` IS NOT NULL\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+--------+\r\n|col.dots|\r\n+--------+\r\n|       1|\r\n+--------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover this. Some tests were added in `ParquetFilterSuite.scala`. Manually, I ran related tests and Jenkins tests will cover

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nPySpark allows to use Python functions as UDF and for common \r\ntransformations like `map` or `filter` calls. Unfortunately, code may\r\ncontains bugs which leads to exceptions. Some Python exceptions are \r\nquite easy to understand and fix, some of them requires to understand\r\noverall function context. For instance:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable\r\n```\r\n\r\nOk, we eventually trying to access `None` value by index or key, but\r\nwhy this value became `None`? That was not in our plans. To understand\r\nwhy, to reproduce the problem, you'd like to see how this function was\r\ncalled and in which state were all it locals.\r\n\r\nSentry is the one of the systems which captures, stores and classifies \r\ntracebacks allowing to easily understand what had gone wrong and quite\r\npopular among Python developers.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, project-wide Sentry configuration cannot be applied to those\r\nfunctions since they are get executed on the remotely, outside project\r\ncontext. So either every function must have a special capture handler\r\nor let the PySpark worker take care about everything.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nWhile we have this patch applied, locally, I'd like to propose it for\r\nupstream. Currently, we have to patch PySpark for every release.\r\nSuddenly, we cannot just patch a single file since we have also ensure\r\nthat this patch will get into pyspark.zip archive, which will be \r\ndeployed to executors. Suddenly, there is no way found to have a plugin \r\nfor PySpark worker to avoid any patches.\r\n\r\n### Known concerns\r\n\r\n1. This adds support for one of many bug tracking systems. That's true.\r\n   The reason \"why Sentry\" is that it's very popular system among Python\r\n   developers and most of them are familiar with. I personally didn't\r\n   heard about else ones used by Python developers, but if there will\r\n   be many of them wanted to support PySpark, we can develop something\r\n   more plug-able solution.\r\n\r\n### Possible alternatives\r\n\r\nYou can wrap ALL your functions which will be executed remotely on \r\nexecutors with some decorator, which will provide same Sentry support\r\nor throw much more verbose traceback, extracting locals via `inspect`\r\nmodule. This was found as very inconvenient way since you'll have to \r\nalways wrap all your functions. Easy to forget to do.\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\n\r\n1. You need to have Sentry client (called raven) available on executors. \r\nIt may be installed there via system package manager or passed via \r\n`sc.addPyFile` as an egg. \r\n\r\n2. Pass Sentry DSN via SparkConfig as executor environment variable \r\n   like:\r\n   ```\r\n   spark.conf.set('spark.executorEnv.SENTRY_DSN', '__DSN__')\r\n   ```\r\n   Additionally, you can configure project release, environment, tags and rest bits via Sentry's \r\n   environment variables:\r\n   - SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT - Optional, provide environment your application is running in, like `production`\r\n   - SENTRY_RELEASE - Optional, provide release version of your application, like `1.0.0`\r\n   - SENTRY_TAGS - Optional, provide tags like `tag1:value1,tag2:value2`\r\n \r\n3. Follow the rest Sentry documentation how to use Sentry if you're not \r\nfamiliar with. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch tested manually on local

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes two things as below:\r\n\r\n- Avoid Unidoc build only if Hadoop 2.6 is explicitly set in SBT build\r\n\r\n  Due to a different dependency resolution in SBT & Unidoc by an unknown reason, the documentation build fails on a specific machine & environment in Jenkins but it was unable to reproduce.\r\n\r\n  So, this PR just checks an environment variable `AMPLAB_JENKINS_BUILD_PROFILE` that is set in Hadoop 2.6 SBT build against branches on Jenkins, and then disables Unidoc build. **Note that PR builder will still build it with Hadoop 2.6 & SBT.**\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  ========================================================================\r\n  Building Unidoc API Documentation\r\n

These are actually being used in `run-tests.py` script - here https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/dev/run-tests.py#L519-L520\r\n\r\n- Revert the previous try\r\n\r\n  After https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17651, it seems the build still fails on SBT Hadoop 2.6 master.  \r\n\r\n  I am unable to reproduce this - https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17477#issuecomment-294094092 and the reviewer was too. So, this got merged as it looks the only way to verify this is to merge it currently (as no one seems able to reproduce this).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI only checked `is_hadoop_version_2_6 = os.environ.get(\"AMPLAB_JENKINS_BUILD_PROFILE\") == \"hadoop2.6\"` is working fine as expected as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import collections\r\n>>> os = collections.namedtuple('os', 'environ')(environ={\"AMPLAB_JENKINS_BUILD_PROFILE\": \"hadoop2.6\"})\r\n>>> print(not os.environ.get(\"AMPLAB_JENKINS_BUILD_PROFILE\") == \"hadoop2.6\")\r\nFalse\r\n>>> os = collections.namedtuple('os', 'environ')(environ={\"AMPLAB_JENKINS_BUILD_PROFILE\": \"hadoop2.7\"})\r\n>>> print(not os.environ.get(\"AMPLAB_JENKINS_BUILD_PROFILE\") == \"hadoop2.6\")\r\nTrue\r\n>>> os = collections.namedtuple('os', 'environ')(environ={})\r\n>>> print(not os.environ.get(\"AMPLAB_JENKINS_BUILD_PROFILE\") == \"hadoop2.6\")\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried many ways but I was unable to reproduce this in my local. Sean also tried the way I did but he was also unable to reproduce this.\r\n\r\nPlease refer the comments in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf a plan has multi-level successive joins, e.g.:\r\n```\r\n         Join\r\n         /   \\\r\n     Union   t5\r\n      /   \\\r\n    Join  t4\r\n    /   \\\r\n  Join  t3\r\n  /  \\\r\n t1   t2\r\n```\r\nCurrently we fail to reorder the inside joins, i.e. t1, t2, t3.\r\n\r\nIn join reorder, we use `OrderedJoin` to indicate a join has been ordered, such that when transforming down the plan, these joins don't need to be rerodered again.\r\n\r\nBut there's a problem in the definition of `OrderedJoin`:\r\nThe real join node is a parameter, but not a child. This breaks the transform procedure because `mapChildren` applies transform function on parameters which should be children.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, we change `OrderedJoin` to a class having the same structure as a join node.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd a corresponding test case.\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-18T07:29:09Z","updated_at":"2017-04-18T12:15:09Z","closed_at":"2017-04-18T12:15:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cdf42734f2ce4fb0cc36f5d4efb18bfdeaeac988","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17668/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17668/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17668/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/522d2fae3d5e35cad96997da73ab4980fb816735","head":{"label":"wzhfy:recursiveReorder","ref":"recursiveReorder","sha":"522d2fae3d5e35cad96997da73ab4980fb816735","user":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66051854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA1MTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"wzhfy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy/spark","description":"Mirror

@skonto @vanzin @ArtRand \r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMesos Kerberos Support.  This does not yet include support for cluster mode, or for delegation token renewal.  That will come in a future PR.\r\n\r\nThe delegation tokens are passed to the executors via RPC.  The driver sets the tokens as a configuration property, which the executors then read by issuing the `RetrieveSparkAppConfig` RPC call (I did not add this call.  It already existed).\r\n\r\n`ConfigurableCredentialProvider` and all of the `CredentialProvider` classes have been moved from the `yarn` to `core` module so that they may be shared by Mesos.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually against a kerberized HDFS cluster.  Verified that the job failed w/o `kinit` and succeeded w/ `kinit`\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-18T00:37:48Z","updated_at":"2017-05-19T18:13:31Z","closed_at":"2017-04-20T22:19:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6fa95e7ab0a0768d81d51bd944a7b45e2b8aa2bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17665/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17665/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17665/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e32afeeac95883138751c060a3ebfaf309e3d22f","head":{"label":"d2iq-archive:SPARK-16742-kerberos","ref":"SPARK-16742-kerberos","sha":"e32afeeac95883138751c060a3ebfaf309e3d22f","user":{"login":"d2iq-archive","id":184508684,"node_id":"O_kgDOCv9hDA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184508684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive","html_url":"https://github.com/d2iq-archive","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34087729,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA4NzcyOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"d2iq-archive/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"d2iq-archive","id":184508684,"node_id":"O_kgDOCv9hDA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184508684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive","html_url":"https://github.com/d2iq-archive","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/d2iq-archive/spark","description":"Mirror

the changes of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17646 made in Branch 2.1, because it breaks the build. It needs the parser interface, but SessionCatalog in branch 2.1 does not have it. \r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe session catalog caches some persistent functions in the `FunctionRegistry`, so there can be duplicates. Our Catalog API `listFunctions` does not handle it.\r\n\r\nIt would be better if `SessionCatalog` API can de-duplciate the records, instead of doing it by each API caller. In `FunctionRegistry`, our functions are identified by the unquoted string. Thus, this PR is try to parse it using our parser interface and then de-duplicate the names.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test cases.","created_at":"2017-04-17T20:25:18Z","updated_at":"2017-04-18T03:37:51Z","closed_at":"2017-04-18T03:37:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f30c77dbca60286ece0319759ba990bf7dde7f9d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17661/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17661/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17661/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/64c252e9bda3ddbab61fc53cf0c79ea94211fca2","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:compilationFix17646","ref":"compilationFix17646","sha":"64c252e9bda3ddbab61fc53cf0c79ea94211fca2","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark Version for a specific application is not displayed on the history page now. It should be nice to switch the spark version on the UI when we click on the specific application.\r\nCurrently there seems to be way as SparkListenerLogStart records the application version. So, it should be trivial to listen to this event and provision this change on the UI.\r\nFor Example\r\n<img width=\"1439\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-04-06 at 3 23 41 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8295799/25092650/41f3970a-2354-11e7-9b0d-4646d0adeb61.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1399\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-04-17 at 9 59 33 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8295799/25092743/9f9e2f28-2354-11e7-9605-f2f1c63f21fe.png\">\r\n\r\n{\"Event\":\"SparkListenerLogStart\",\"Spark Version\":\"2.0.0\"}\r\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix)\r\nModified the SparkUI for History server to listen to SparkLogListenerStart event and extract the version and print it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManual testing of UI page.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis was suggested to be `as.json.array` at the first place in the PR to SPARK-19828 but we could not do this as the lint check emits an error for multiple dots in the variable names.\r\n\r\nAfter SPARK-20278, now we are able to use `multiple.dots.in.names`. `asJsonArray` in `from_json` function is still able to be changed as 2.2 is not released yet.\r\n\r\nSo, this PR proposes to rename `asJsonArray` to `as.json.array`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests, local tests with `./R/run-tests.sh` and manual `./dev/lint-r`. Existing tests should cover this.\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-16T21:49:16Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:38:23Z","closed_at":"2017-04-17T16:06:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bc0e877ae43c00c544a9e2fef40ceaceb1d904a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17653/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17653/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17653/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/17d819022de875777e158e94ad3ef1c8d6d2f3aa","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-19828-followup","ref":"SPARK-19828-followup","sha":"17d819022de875777e158e94ad3ef1c8d6d2f3aa","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTable comment was not getting  set/unset using **ALTER TABLE  SET/UNSET TBLPROPERTIES** query\r\neg: ALTER TABLE table_with_comment SET

updated and  old table comment if exists was shown to user, inorder  to handle this issue, update the comment field value in **CatalogTable** with the newly added/modified comment along with other table level properties when user executes **ALTER TABLE  SET TBLPROPERTIES** query.\r\n\r\nThis pr has also taken care of unsetting the table comment when user executes query  **ALTER TABLE  UNSET TBLPROPERTIES** inorder to unset or remove table comment.\r\neg: ALTER TABLE table_comment UNSET TBLPROPERTIES IF EXISTS ('comment')\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test cases  as part

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe session catalog caches some persistent functions in the `FunctionRegistry`, so there can be duplicates. Our Catalog API `listFunctions` does not handle it.\r\n\r\nIt would be better if `SessionCatalog` API can de-duplciate the records, instead of doing it by each API caller. In `FunctionRegistry`, our functions are identified by the unquoted string. Thus, this PR is try to parse it using our parser interface and then de-duplicate the names.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHive allows inserting data to bucketed table without guaranteeing bucketed and sorted-ness based on these two configs : `hive.enforce.bucketing` and `hive.enforce.sorting`.\r\n\r\nWhat does this PR achieve ?\r\n- Spark will disallow users from writing outputs to hive bucketed tables by default (given that output won't adhere with Hive's semantics).\r\n- IF user still wants to write to hive bucketed table, the only resort is to use `hive.enforce.bucketing=false` and `hive.enforce.sorting=false` which means user does NOT care about bucketing guarantees.\r\n\r\nChanges done in this PR:\r\n- Extract table's bucketing information in `HiveClientImpl`\r\n- While writing table info to metastore, `HiveClientImpl` now populates the bucketing information in the hive `Table` object\r\n- `InsertIntoHiveTable` allows inserts to bucketed table only if both `hive.enforce.bucketing` and `hive.enforce.sorting` are `false`\r\n\r\nAbility to create bucketed tables will enable adding test cases to Spark while I add more changes related to hive bucketing support. Design doc for hive hive bucketing support : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a8IDh23RAkrkg9YYAeO51F4aGO8-xAlupKwdshve2fc/edit#\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added test for creating bucketed and sorted table.\r\n- Added test to ensure that INSERTs fail if strict bucket / sort is enforced\r\n- Added test to ensure that INSERTs can go through if strict bucket / sort is NOT enforced\r\n- Added test to validate that bucketing information shows up in output of DESC FORMATTED\r\n- Added test to ensure that `SHOW CREATE TABLE` works for hive bucketed

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[SPARK-5100](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/343d3bfafd449a0371feb6a88f78e07302fa7143) added Spark Thrift Server(STS) UI and the following logic to handle exceptions on case `Throwable`.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nHiveThriftServer2.listener.onStatementError(\r\n  statementId, e.getMessage, SparkUtils.exceptionString(e))\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, there occurred a missed case after implementing [SPARK-6964](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/eb19d3f75cbd002f7e72ce02017a8de67f562792)'s `Support Cancellation in the Thrift Server` by adding case `HiveSQLException` before case `Throwable`.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ncase e: HiveSQLException =>\r\n  if (getStatus().getState() == OperationState.CANCELED) {\r\n    return\r\n  } else {\r\n    setState(OperationState.ERROR)\r\n    throw e\r\n  }\r\n  // Actually do need to catch Throwable as some failures don't inherit from Exception and\r\n  // HiveServer will silently swallow them.\r\ncase e: Throwable =>\r\n  val currentState = getStatus().getState()\r\n  logError(s\"Error executing query, currentState $currentState, \", e)\r\n  setState(OperationState.ERROR)\r\n  HiveThriftServer2.listener.onStatementError(\r\n    statementId, e.getMessage, SparkUtils.exceptionString(e))\r\n  throw new HiveSQLException(e.toString)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLogically, we had better add `HiveThriftServer2.listener.onStatementError` on case `HiveSQLException`, too.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nA cast expression with a resolved time zone is not equal to a cast expression without a resolved time zone. The `ResolveAggregateFunction` assumed that these expression were the same, and would fail to resolve `HAVING` clauses which contain a `Cast` expression.\r\n\r\nThis is in essence caused by the fact that a `TimeZoneAwareExpression` can be resolved without a set time zone. This PR fixes this, and makes a `TimeZoneAwareExpression` unresolved as long as it has no TimeZone set.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a regression test to the `SQLQueryTestSuite.having`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17398 we introduced `UnresolvedMapObjects` as a placeholder of `MapObjects`. Unfortunately `UnresolvedMapObjects` is not serializable as its `function` may reference Scala `Type` which is not serializable.\r\n\r\nIdeally this is fine, as we will never serialize and send unresolved expressions to executors. However users may accidentally do this, e.g. mistakenly reference an encoder instance when implementing `Aggregator`, we should fix it so that it's just a performance issue(more network traffic) and should not fail the query.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpaces in spark.eventLog.dir are not correctly handled.\r\n1. “spark.eventLog.dir” supports with space characters.\r\n2. As usually, if the run classpath includes hdfs-site.xml and core-site.xml files, the supplied path eg.\"/testdir\" which does not contain a scheme should be taken as a HDFS path rather than a local path since the path parameter is a Hadoop dir.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExist tests and manual tests\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-14T10:34:07Z","updated_at":"2017-06-22T03:24:05Z","closed_at":"2017-06-08T10:18:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"55dde7ff0553cc23e9ba5abe5781452ea523554a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17638/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17638/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17638/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4b203f16fa52ba9f20c21a4ae02799f289f980c1","head":{"label":"zuotingbing:spark-eventlogdir","ref":"spark-eventlogdir","sha":"4b203f16fa52ba9f20c21a4ae02799f289f980c1","user":{"login":"zuotingbing","id":24823338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODIzMzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24823338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing","html_url":"https://github.com/zuotingbing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79180557,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3OTE4MDU1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"zuotingbing/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zuotingbing","id":24823338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODIzMzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24823338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing","html_url":"https://github.com/zuotingbing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuotingbing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zuotingbing/spark","description":"Mirror

to Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20331)\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark 2.1 introduced scalable support for Hive tables with huge numbers of partitions. Key to leveraging this support is the ability to prune unnecessary table partitions to answer queries. Spark supports a subset of the class of partition pruning predicates that the Hive metastore supports. If a user writes a query with a partition pruning predicate that is *not* supported by Spark, Spark falls back to loading all partitions and pruning client-side. We want to broaden Spark's current partition pruning predicate pushdown capabilities.\r\n\r\nOne of the key missing capabilities is support for disjunctions. For example, for a table partitioned by date, writing a query with a predicate like\r\n\r\n    date = 20161011 or date = 20161014\r\n\r\nwill result in Spark fetching all partitions. For a table partitioned by date and hour, querying a range of hours across dates can be quite difficult to accomplish without fetching all partition metadata.\r\n\r\nThe current partition pruning support supports only comparisons against literals. We can expand that to foldable expressions by evaluating them at planning time.\r\n\r\nWe can also implement support for the \"IN\" comparison by expanding it to a sequence of \"OR\"s.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe `HiveClientSuite` and `VersionsSuite` were refactored and simplified to make Hive client-based, version-specific testing more modular and conceptually simpler. There are now two Hive test suites: `HiveClientSuite` and `HivePartitionFilteringSuite`. These test suites have a single-argument constructor taking a `version` parameter. As such, these test suites cannot be run by themselves. Instead, they have been bundled into \"aggregation\" test suites which run each suite for each Hive client version. These aggregation suites are called `HiveClientSuites` and `HivePartitionFilteringSuites`. The `VersionsSuite` and `HiveClientSuite` have been refactored into each of these aggregation suites, respectively.\r\n\r\n`HiveClientSuite` and `HivePartitionFilteringSuite` subclass a new abstract class, `HiveVersionSuite`. `HiveVersionSuite` collects functionality related to testing a single Hive version and overrides relevant test suite methods to display version-specific information.\r\n\r\nA new trait, `HiveClientVersions`, has been added with a sequence of Hive test versions.","created_at":"2017-04-14T00:20:10Z","updated_at":"2018-08-12T05:05:16Z","closed_at":"2017-07-11T06:52:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"712704d2b73e020f94eb3670bffd86286bdde602","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17633/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17633/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17633/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/af3065a0da64251350eca241b4eb3c3c9447f114","head":{"label":"VideoAmp:spark-20331-enhanced_partition_pruning_pushdown","ref":"spark-20331-enhanced_partition_pruning_pushdown","sha":"af3065a0da64251350eca241b4eb3c3c9447f114","user":{"login":"VideoAmp","id":7621972,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjE5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7621972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp","html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49447912,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTQ0NzkxMg==","name":"spark-public","full_name":"VideoAmp/spark-public","private":false,"owner":{"login":"VideoAmp","id":7621972,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjE5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7621972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp","html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp/spark-public","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently when estimating predicates like col > literal or col = literal, we will update min or max in column stats based on literal value. However, literal value is of Catalyst type (internal type), while min/max is of external type. Then for the next predicate, we again need to do type conversion to compare and update column stats. This is awkward and causes many unnecessary conversions in estimation.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, we use Catalyst type for min/max in `ColumnStat`. Note that the persistent format in metastore is still of external type, so there's no inconsistency for statistics in metastore.\r\n\r\nThis pr also fixes a bug for boolean type in `IN` condition.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe changes for ColumnStat are covered by existing tests. \r\nFor bug fix, a new test for boolean type in IN condition is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is to backport the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17265 to Spark 2.1 branch.\r\n\r\n---\r\nSince we are using shim for most Hive metastore APIs, the exceptions thrown by the underlying method of Method.invoke() are wrapped by `InvocationTargetException`. Instead of doing it one by one, we should handle all of them in the `withClient`. If any of them is missing, the error message could looks unfriendly. For example, below is an example for dropping tables. \r\n\r\n```\r\nExpected exception org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException to be thrown, but java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException was
