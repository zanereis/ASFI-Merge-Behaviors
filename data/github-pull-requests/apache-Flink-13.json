you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nReverting previous changes that break state compatibility.\r\n\r\n[FLINK-34123](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-34123) & [FLINK-35068](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-35068) introduced built-in dedicated serialization support for Maps, Sets, Lists, and Collections. However, if a user defines a collection-typed value in state, the default serializer is changed from Kryo to dedicated serializer, breaking compatibility. Furthermore, since RocksDBStateBackend does not support serialization format change for the keys in MapState, we cannot implement a fully-compatible solution for this case.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nRevert the following three commits:\r\n1. [FLINK-34123][core][type] Introduce built-in serialization support for Map, List, and Collection\r\n2. [FLINK-34123][docs][type] Add doc for built-in serialization support for Map, List, and Collection\r\n3. [FLINK-35068][core][type] Introduce built-in serialization support for

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd file size and file count metrics for file-merging.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Add `logicalFileCount`, `logicalFileSize`, `physicalFileCount`, `physicalFileSize` metrics.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- `FileMergingMetricsTest`\r\n \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n_The purpose of this change is to optimize the performance of LookupTableSource in Flink by introducing a custom partitioning strategy that connectors can declare. This strategy ensures each LookupTableSource subtask receives only a specific portion of the input data, thereby altering the data inflow pattern into the lookup source._\r\n\r\n## Verifying this

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdditional configuration options for internal and REST SSL setup.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* SSL configuration option for internal and REST SSL keystore/truststore type\r\n* Use new option when initializing SSLHandlerFactory\r\n* Extend CustomSSLEngineProvider used by Pekko\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - Unit tests to ensure new configuration options can be picked up\r\n  - Manually verified the change by running a cluster using a BKS keystore and truststore that is not available by default.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? docs\r\n

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdditional configuration options for internal and REST SSL setup.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* SSL configuration option for internal and REST SSL keystore/truststore type\r\n* Use new option when initializing SSLHandlerFactory\r\n* Extend CustomSSLEngineProvider used by Pekko\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - Unit tests to ensure new configuration options can be picked up\r\n  - Manually verified the change by running a cluster using a BKS keystore and truststore that is not available by default.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? docs\r\n

What is the purpose of the change\r\n* This Pull Request addresses an important state memory leak issue identified within the default window operator of Apache Flink. \r\n* After this change, the cleanup timer should be registered for every window that's added to the window state regardless of it emitting a result after it’s fired.\r\n* This change is associated to the following bug: [FLINK-33192\r\n](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues/FLINK-33192)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nModified `org.apache.flink.streaming.runtime.operators.windowing.WindowOperator` to register clean up timer for window states regardless of whether emits a result or not. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n- WindowOperatorTest is working for functional correctness.\r\n- Written a new test `testCleanupTimerWithEmptyStateNoResultForTumblingWindows`. This test simulates a empty returning aggregate function with tumbling windows. The passing of the test validates that the window contents are being cleared during the time the cleanup time is actually supposed to be called. Hence, the memory leak should not be happening after the change. \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-08T07:50:00Z","updated_at":"2024-07-06T04:34:43Z","closed_at":"2024-07-06T04:34:43Z","merged_at":"2024-07-06T04:34:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"e78524a87808913bfcd6a84847af46501a9a7266","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273319732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzE5NzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/StateBackends","name":"component=Runtime/StateBackends","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24917/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24917/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24917/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d745169b106e3d20a90a744678a7ecbede5fd55d","head":{"label":"kartikeypant:fix-FLINK-33192-memory-leak","ref":"fix-FLINK-33192-memory-leak","sha":"d745169b106e3d20a90a744678a7ecbede5fd55d","user":{"login":"kartikeypant","id":12978441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc4NDQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12978441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant","html_url":"https://github.com/kartikeypant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":812156204,"node_id":"R_kgDOMGiFLA","name":"flink","full_name":"kartikeypant/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kartikeypant","id":12978441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc4NDQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12978441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant","html_url":"https://github.com/kartikeypant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kartikeypant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kartikeypant/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMake ListSerializer allow null values. Background: see [FLINK-35555](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-35555).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add a binary mask for marking null values in `ListSerializer`.\r\n- Update `ListSerializerSnapshot` to deal with state-compatibility.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Add tests on lists with null values in `ListSerializerTest`.\r\n- Updated `ListSerializerUpgradeTest` to test state-compatibility.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-07T15:31:52Z","updated_at":"2025-01-06T09:24:06Z","closed_at":"2025-01-06T09:22:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d1954573a36e5d5aa5fe69c3b5537c1798e644f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273183016,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgzMDE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","name":"component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24916/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24916/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24916/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0aadea592267fe33db71bb22912ea86bb43279a8","head":{"label":"X-czh:FLINK-35555","ref":"FLINK-35555","sha":"0aadea592267fe33db71bb22912ea86bb43279a8","user":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":439573734,"node_id":"R_kgDOGjNc5g","name":"flink","full_name":"X-czh/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImprove the user experience of contributing documentation.\r\n\r\nTicket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-35558\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nChanged the \"Edit This Page\" feature to use `master` branch instead of the release branch (e.g., `release-1.19`).\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as building/verifying locally.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nProvides a way to handle output stream based compaction in case the data stream is compressed. The problem is described well in the Jira ticket. This change introduces some modifications in case the data is written via `CompressWriterFactory`, which will be compressed. In those cases, the stream that actually writes to the compacted file should not be compressed, as the written data which we compact is already written out into compressed part files, so we simply concat them.\r\n\r\n**Of course, this is only usable for Hadoop compression codecs that are concatenable, namely: DEFATE, GZIP, BZIP2.**\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added `CompressWriterFactory#createWithNoCompression(...)` to be able to enforce skipping compression for the compacting phase, even if the data itself is compressed.\r\n- Updated `BulkBucketWriter#openNew(...)` to use the newly introduced `createWithNoCompression` when it is called to open a new compacting file, which should not use any kind of compression, as the data is already compressed.\r\n- Adapted `OutputStreamBasedBucketWriter` to the above changes.\r\n- Changed `AbstractCompactTestBase` to `protected` to be able to use in the new `CompactServiceTest` that is in a diff. package.\r\n- Moved some test helper methods to `AbstractCompactTestBase` to avoid/eliminate duplication.\r\n- Extracted `TestBucketWriter` to its own class, as it is now used in multiple test files.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added new unit tests for the newly introduced logic in `CompactServiceTest`.\r\n- Added a new integration test `CompressedCompactionITCase` to validate compaction on all supported compressed output that is concatenable.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? debatable\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Introduced new `CheckpointLifecyclListener` that allows the `AdaptiveScheduler` to monitor checkpoint completion\r\n* `RescaleManager.Context.onTrigger` will be called if a checkpoint was completed or if a configured amount of subsequent failed checkpoints appeared (new configuration parameter: `jobmanager.adaptive-scheduler.rescale-on-failed-checkpoints-count`)

to the `CheckpointsStatsTracker` to monitor checkpoint-related events.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Refactors `CheckpointStatsTracker` constructor to not rely on the total subtask count anymore when initializing the tracker\r\n* Moves `CheckpointStatsTracker` ownership from `DefaultExecutionGraphFactory` to the scheduler implementations\r\n* Makes `CheckpointStatsTracker` an \"implementation detail\" of the execution graph that's not exposed through API.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* Existing tests are covering the change.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one

endpoint that can be used to initiate a possible rescaling.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Introduces `RescaleManager#onTrigger` as a new interface method\r\n* Adds `DefaultRescaleManager#onTrigger` implementation\r\n* Makes `Executing` call the new `onTrigger` method subsequently to `onChange` to simulate the old behavior\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* Adapted `DefaultRescaleManagerTest` to run `onTrigger` subsequently to `onChange` for now\r\n* Adds new test for checking noop behaviour if only on `onTrigger` is called (i.e. for AUTO-649 this means that a checkpoint is completed w/o a previous rescale event)\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a

PR Chain\r\n\r\n* ⭐ FLINK-35550: https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/24909\r\n* FLINK-35551: https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/24910\r\n* FLINK-35552: https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/24911\r\n* FLINK-35553: https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/24912\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is the reorganization of responsibilities for rescaling.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n[Class diagrams](https://app.diagrams.net/#G13IwZnJrZ_NBxkDYdAUz2IydP3A5qv8uH#%7B%22pageId%22%3A%22C5RBs43oDa-KdzZeNtuy%22%7D)\r\n\r\n* Introduction of new interfaces `RescaleManager`, `RescaleManager.Context` and `RescaleManager.Factory`\r\n* Responsibilities:\r\n  * `AdaptiveScheduler` only provides the available parallelism (through the `SlotManager`). The rescalingControllers moved into `RescaleManager`\r\n  * `Executing` is only in charge of state transitition and savepoints\r\n  * `RescaleManager` handles the rescale decisions\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe tests were reorganized accordingly. Some additional unit tests are added to improve coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: yes\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

Backporting to 1.19, See #24902 \r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSee FLINK-35537, an exception thrown when setting 'state.backend.rocksdb.compression.per.level' in flink 1.19.0. I have confirmed that the problem comes from the `EmbeddedRocksDBStateBackend#mergeConfigurableOptions`, which merges two configuration map into one. It uses `toString` of each already parsed value and insert the value string into a new raw map. The `toString` gives the string format of enum list, not the legacy yaml form of the value. The new raw map get parsed later, that's when the error happens.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes `EmbeddedRocksDBStateBackend#mergeConfigurableOptions`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - `EmbeddedRocksDBStateBackend#mergeConfigurableOptions`.\r\n - Added test `testConfigureRocksDBCompressionPerLevel`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNewly added test `testConfigureRocksDBCompressionPerLevel`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix broken link to \"Anatomy of the Flink distrubution\" documentation in dev/configuration/connector.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nFix broken link to \"Anatomy of the Flink distrubution\" documentation in dev/configuration/connector.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as verifying the link locally.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the

PR depends on https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/24895 . Only the last commit should be reviewed here.\r\n\r\nWhen operators are yielding, for example waiting for async state access to complete before a checkpoint, it would be beneficial to not execute interruptible mails. Otherwise continuation mail for firing timers would be continuously re-enqeueed.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSee FLINK-35537, an exception thrown when setting 'state.backend.rocksdb.compression.per.level' in flink 1.19.0. I have confirmed that the problem comes from the `EmbeddedRocksDBStateBackend#mergeConfigurableOptions`, which merges two configuration map into one. It uses `toString` of each already parsed value and insert the value string into a new raw map. The `toString` gives the string format of enum list, not the legacy yaml form of the value. The new raw map get parsed later, that's when the error happens.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes `EmbeddedRocksDBStateBackend#mergeConfigurableOptions`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - `EmbeddedRocksDBStateBackend#mergeConfigurableOptions`.\r\n - Added test `testConfigureRocksDBCompressionPerLevel`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNewly added test `testConfigureRocksDBCompressionPerLevel`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix typo\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFlink CI\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`:no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Flink hybrid shuffle supports transitions between memory, disk, and remote storage to improve performance and job stability. Concurrently, Apache Celeborn provides a stable, performant, scalable remote shuffle service. This integration proposal is to harness the benefits from both hybrid shuffle and Celeborn simultaneously. This change is a pluggable remote tier implementation in Flink side.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Create teir factories according to the configured remote tier class*\r\n  - *Refactor the APIs and implementations for supporting remote tier plugin*\r\n  - *Add a option to config the external remote tier factory class*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this changeq\r\n  - *Added test `TierFactoryInitializerTest` that validates the creation of tier factories*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (Yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIf the source task does not get assigned a split because the SplitEnumerator has no more splits, and a failover occurs during the closing process, the SourceCoordinatorContext will not resend the NoMoreSplit event to the newly started source task, causing the source vertex to remain stuck indefinitely.\r\nThis case may only occur in batch jobs where speculative execution has been enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *fix the issue that the source task may get stuck in speculative execution mode.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIf the source task does not get assigned a split because the SplitEnumerator has no more splits, and a failover occurs during the closing process, the SourceCoordinatorContext will not resend the NoMoreSplit event to the newly started source task, causing the source vertex to remain stuck indefinitely.\r\nThis case may only occur in batch jobs where speculative execution has been enabled.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nfix the issue that the source task may get stuck in speculative execution mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  -

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently many operators when processing watermarks, are firing multiple timers each producing potentially multiple output records. If this happens under back-pressure, it can quite easily block the subtask thread in the hard back-pressure state for an extended period of time blocking mailbox from processing any incoming mails, like processing checkpoint barriers and completing unaligned checkpoints.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, we would like to propose to make firing multiple timers interruptible in such a way, that Flink would be able to interrupt firing timers, perform checkpoint and return back to firing timers.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nPlease check individual commit messages.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nCovered by both existing tests and added new tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMake hdfs token fetched by custom delegation token provider pass to yarn am.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no \r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no \r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper:no \r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no \r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, we depend on asm to extract method parameter names. We custom a MethodVisitor to visit local variable tables in  file `.class`, and then cut the first `N` local variable names as the method parameter names. \r\n\r\nHowever, if there are multi blocks about one local variable, the first `N` local variable names could be same, and then wrongly be extracted, and crashed when validating the conflict of them(the new logic added in FLINK-1.19).\r\n\r\nThis pr will use the slot index in `.class` file to extract the method parameter names, because method parameter names are always at the head in the 'slot index' list(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se17/html/jvms-3.html)\r\n\r\nTake the test function `ExtractionUtilsTest#MultiLocalVariableBlocksWithoutInitializationClass` as an example:\r\n\r\n- Before fix:\r\n1. extract parameter names from asm: \r\n`[localVariable, localVariable, localVariable, this, generic, genericFuture, listOfGenericFuture, array, localVariable]`\r\n2. get the first 4 after offset 1(expected `this` in index 0)\r\n`[localVariable, localVariable, this, generic]`\r\n\r\nThis is because in local variable table, there are multi `localVariable` with different lifecycle in different blocks.\r\n\r\n- After fix:\r\n1. extract parameter names from asm: \r\n`[this, generic, genericFuture, listOfGenericFuture, array, localVariable]`\r\n2. get the first 4 after offset 1(expected `this` in index 0)\r\n`[generic, genericFuture, listOfGenericFuture, array]`\r\n\r\nThat's what we expected.\r\n\r\nFurther more, if the local variable has been initialized before `if statement`, its lifecycle is across all `if` blocks, and there is no need to init new local variable `localVariable` for it. Otherwize, `localVariable` in multi blocks are actually not visible although it is declared at first, and jvm will create multi `localVariable` for different blocks and add it in local variable table(You can see in local variable table, although these `localVariable`'s slots are same, but their start label and end label are different).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Fix the logic in ExtractionUtils*\r\n  - *Add tests to verify this fix*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nSome tests are added to verity it.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIf the source task does not get assigned a split because the SplitEnumerator has no more splits, and a failover occurs during the closing process, the SourceCoordinatorContext will not resend the NoMoreSplit event to the newly started source task, causing the source vertex to remain stuck indefinitely. \r\nThis case may only occur in batch jobs where speculative execution has been enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - fix the issue that the source task may get stuck in speculative execution mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the SQL parser changes for ALTER TABLE to support ADD, MODIFY, and DROP DISTRIBUTION statements.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nThe SQL Parser has been updated.\r\nThe `AlterSchemaConverter` has been updated to pass the changes in a DISTRIBUTION through to the `Operation`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request

Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUpdate the Experimental annotation for files connector\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nUpdate the Experimental annotation for files connector\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-04T11:05:54Z","updated_at":"2024-06-12T12:51:01Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb38118ad0e56991dc845400e4f86f4a682bb023","assignee":{"login":"1996fanrui","id":38427477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI3NDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38427477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui","html_url":"https://github.com/1996fanrui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"1996fanrui","id":38427477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI3NDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38427477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui","html_url":"https://github.com/1996fanrui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273335481,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzM1NDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/FileSystem","name":"component=Connectors/FileSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24885/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24885/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24885/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/11ff6f8ba3f469c7209b472c4b5385f9edab37ba","head":{"label":"RocMarshal:FLINK-35516","ref":"FLINK-35516","sha":"11ff6f8ba3f469c7209b472c4b5385f9edab37ba","user":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260947074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjA5NDcwNzQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"RocMarshal/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_eve

ignore the 1st commit - it comes from #24880 \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n```\r\nCurrently, each RocksDB state backend creates an executor backed by a\r\nthread pool.\r\n\r\nThis makes it difficult to control the total number of threads per TM\r\nbecause it might have at least one task per slot and theoretically, many\r\nstate backends per task (because of chaining).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, using a common thread pool allows to indirectly control\r\nthe load on the underlying DFS (e.g. the total number of requests to S3\r\nfrom a TM).\r\n\r\nThis change allows to control the total number of data transfers per TM.\r\n```","created_at":"2024-06-03T14:31:17Z","updated_at":"2024-06-06T12:19:07Z","closed_at":"2024-06-06T12:18:41Z","merged_at":"2024-06-06T12:18:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"9708f9fd65751296b3b0377c964207b630958259","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"pnowojski","id":8957547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTc1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8957547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski","html_url":"https://github.com/pnowojski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273319732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzE5NzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/StateBackends","name":"component=Runtime/StateBackends","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24882/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24882/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24882/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/ff97ea29c97c44b09eb84411175bdc62442e5fdb","head":{"label":"rkhachatryan:f35501","ref":"f35501","sha":"ff97ea29c97c44b09eb84411175bdc62442e5fdb","user":{"login":"rkhachatryan","id":3939322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzkzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3939322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan","html_url":"https://github.com/rkhachatryan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222429887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI0Mjk4ODc=","name":"flink","full_name":"rkhachatryan/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rkhachatryan","id":3939322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzkzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3939322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan","html_url":"https://github.com/rkhachatryan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rkhachatryan/flink","description":"Apache

Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRename checkpoint related options\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Rename checkpoint related options with prefix 'execution.checkpointing'\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / **docs** / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-03T03:39:40Z","updated_at":"2024-06-13T05:57:04Z","closed_at":"2024-06-13T05:57:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a311d8142798eefc918e086de62dcc2f3cac2e58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24878/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24878/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24878/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/cad4b662acac8cc3f635e45b550ace1561e8d905","head":{"label":"masteryhx:FLINK-34482","ref":"FLINK-34482","sha":"cad4b662acac8cc3f635e45b550ace1561e8d905","user":{"login":"masteryhx","id":38719192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzE5MTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38719192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx","html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":436096625,"node_id":"R_kgDOGf5OcQ","name":"flink","full_name":"masteryhx/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"masteryhx","id":38719192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzE5MTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38719192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx","html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUpdate the batch job recovery documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nUpdate the batch job recovery documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix unstable BatchJobRecoveryTest.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests BatchJobRecoveryTest.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n```\r\nLimit Global Aggregation buffers\r\n\r\nIn case of large windows and/or lagging watermarks,\r\nRecordsWindowBuffer processes buffered records and flushes the state\r\nduring the sync phase of the checkpoint causing checkpoint timeout.\r\n\r\nThis change limits the number of records buffered and the buffer size.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nLimit Local Aggregation buffers \r\n\r\nThe buffer holds records for aggregation in memory and is flushed downstream on:\r\n1) checkpoints, 2) watermarks, or 3) when it is full.\r\nIf it's too big (even if watermarks are progressing),\r\nthere might be much more data to flush than the memory available (classic flatMap problem).\r\nThat might lead to back-pressure and hard-blocking the task thread.\r\n\r\nThis change limits the buffer and the number of records.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, Flink allows creating gauge metrics with various types [[1]](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/ops/metrics/#gauge). However Web UI doesn't support showing any types other than numerics and always displays `NaN`, which isn't very helpful. This change lets dashboard displays raw metric value when converting to numbers isn't applicable.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Adds raw value display as fallback when receiving non-numeric metric values\r\n  - Changes \"Chart / Numeric\" label to \"Chart / Literal\" because not all metrics are of number type\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial work without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWe require maven v3.8.6 (not higher) to build flink, otherwise, it'll get error:\r\n`Detected Maven Version: 3.9.6 is not in the allowed range [3.8.6,3.8.6].`\r\n\r\nIn English version [README.md](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/README.md#building-apache-flink-from-source), we also mention we require maven v3.8.6. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nUpdate

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this change is to limit multipart requests to POST endpoints and file upload endpoint. Prior to this change, any request could be a multipart request (and upload a file).\r\n\r\nWith this change, the behavior of `FileUploadHandler` will be as follows:\r\n1. Only accept a multipart request if the endpoint handler accepts POST requests.\r\n2. Only accept a file upload if the endpoint handler accept file uploads.\r\n\r\nNote that there multipart requests can mix file uploads with regular requests.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add `MultipartRoutes` in the `*.router` package for re-use of existing path patterns utilities.\r\n  - Factor out `RestServerEndpoint#getHandlerUrls(RestHandlerSpecification)` in order to ensure that we have a consistent way of getting the registered endpoint URLs.\r\n  - Add `MultipartRoutes` to `FileUploadHandler` and populate from handler list in `RestServerEndpoint`.\r\n  - Validate that all multipart requests go to a POST endpoint.\r\n  - Validate that file uploads go to a endpoint that accepts file uploads.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as `RestServerEndpointITCase` and `FileUploadHandlerITCase`. I made minor additions to these tests.\r\n\r\nI manually verified that I can submit jobs via `bin/flink run` and `curl` both when web sumission is enabled and disabled.\r\n\r\nThe following gets logged in DEBUG on startup:\r\n\r\nWhen web submission enabled:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDEBUG org.apache.flink.runtime.dispatcher.DispatcherRestEndpoint   [] - Using MultipartRoutes{postRoutes=[v1/jars/upload,

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd documents for batch job recovery from jobMaster failover.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdd documents for batch job recovery from jobMaster failover.\r\n\r\nThe updated document is shown in the figure:\r\n\r\nChinese version:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/107924572/01727e84-e7b3-4f8e-b711-a6e3acde7817)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish version:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/107924572/3e098e93-d25e-47a8-993b-d46db98e2f76)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / **docs** / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-28T08:34:21Z","updated_at":"2024-05-30T07:07:07Z","closed_at":"2024-05-30T05:43:15Z","merged_at":"2024-05-30T05:43:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"aabfd6e2eaa37d554632129c959a309f85d528c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24855/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24855/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24855/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/11aeee76f999a6bc5227f32241b5db445457aa71","head":{"label":"JunRuiLee:jm_fo_doc","ref":"jm_fo_doc","sha":"11aeee76f999a6bc5227f32241b5db445457aa71","user":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":515412374,"node_id":"R_kgDOHriRlg","name":"flink","full_name":"JunRuiLee/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nJIRA: [FLINK-33503](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-33503)\r\n\r\n[FLINK-33503](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-33503) enabled us to add checksum checks for the Maven wrapper binaries along the update from 3.1.0 to 3.2.0.\r\n\r\nBut there seems to be an issue with verifying the wrapper's checksum under windows (see [MVRAPPER-103](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MWRAPPER-103)). After MVRAPPER-103 is resolved in 3.3.0, we should upgrade Maven wrapper to 3.3.0 or later to enable the feature to verify the wrapper's checksum. \r\n\r\nThis PR did:\r\n1. Upgrade Maven wrapper to the latest 3.3.2 version to include more bug fixes.\r\n2. Update the `wrapperSha256Sum` for `maven-wrapper-3.3.2.jar`\r\n3. Update the mvnw auto-generated script in v3.3.2.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Upgrade Maven wrapper to the latest 3.3.2 version to include more bug fixes.\r\n  - Update the `wrapperSha256Sum` for `maven-wrapper-3.3.2.jar`\r\n  - Update the mvnw auto-generated script in v3.3.2.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAfter the change, maven build runs successfully.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):  no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? no\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-28T04:13:00Z","updated_at":"2024-08-14T19:27:32Z","closed_at":"2024-08-14T19:26:15Z","merged_at":"2024-08-14T19:26:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"e9dd4683f758b463d0b5ee18e49cecef6a70c5cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0Njc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=BuildSystem","name":"component=BuildSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24852/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24852/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24852/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/7c6f9a2fba68550785dcf100b1b2f7d305b9d221","head":{"label":"showuon:FLINK-33607","ref":"FLINK-33607","sha":"7c6f9a2fba68550785dcf100b1b2f7d305b9d221","user":{"login":"showuon","id":43372967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzcyOTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43372967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon","html_url":"https://github.com/showuon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":806848988,"node_id":"R_kgDOMBeJ3A","name":"flink","full_name":"showuon/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"showuon","id":43372967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzcyOTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43372967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon","html_url":"https://github.com/showuon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/showuon/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix incompatible type of JobManagerOptions.SLOT_REQUEST_OUT value.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-28T03:14:58Z","updated_at":"2024-05-28T05:21:31Z","closed_at":"2024-05-28T03:32:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1da1258b46bdf1327c139015803c8cdb76137b86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24851/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24851/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24851/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e672a30887809c13a14c4103076f560ebbcee092","head":{"label":"X-czh:FLINK-35465-hotfix","ref":"FLINK-35465-hotfix","sha":"e672a30887809c13a14c4103076f560ebbcee092","user":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":439573734,"node_id":"R_kgDOGjNc5g","name":"flink","full_name":"X-czh/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAs described in the issue FLINK-35427, this pull request trying to introduce a config in json format, so we can fail the flink job when the input schema evolves.\r\n\r\nCopy from FLINK-35427:\r\nIn many cases, the consumer and producer of message queues come from different teams, or even different companies.\r\nAs a message consumer, sometimes it is difficult to subscribe updates on message's format, which may result in data loss.\r\nWe want to ensure the message format strictly matches the schema, if some field is missing or new field is added, it is better to fail the application so that we can notice and fix it quickly.\r\nIn this case, a fail-on-unknown-field config for JSON format could be very helpful, especially when works with fail-on-missing-field.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add JsonFormatOptions.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_FIELD\r\n- Add unknown field check code in converter classes\r\n- Add JsonSchemaException, which extends JsonParseException\r\n- Fix some test cases that were not working properly\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n`JsonFormatFactoryTest#testFailOnUnknownField`\r\n`JsonParserRowDataDeSerSchemaTest#testParsePartialJson`\r\n`JsonRowDataSerDeSchemaTest#testDeserializationUnknownField`\r\n`JsonRowDeserializationSchemaTest#testUnknownNode`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdjust read size when ByteBuffer size is larger than file size to avoid bb.remaining() exceeding the file size limit.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Adjust read size in ByteBufferReadableFSDataInputStream#readFully when ByteBuffer size is larger than file size\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Add case ForStFlinkFileSystemTest#testReadExceedingFileSize\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n1. The `PhysicalFile#outputStream` may be closed by both `innerClose` and `deleteIfNecessary`, we need to ensure that it is only closed once.\r\n2. Stream tasks on one Task Manager may be initialized at the same time. It is necessary to ensure that `FileMergingSnapshotManager#fileSystem` on a Task Manager is only initialized once.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Acquire lock before `PhysicalFile#innerClose`\r\n- Acquire lock when `FileMergingSnapshotManagerBase#initFileSystem`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce built-in serialization support for sets, which falls back to Kyro previously.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nIntroduce dedicated serializer and de-serializer for sets and add built-in serialization support for sets when extracting types.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests that validate:\r\n- sets are correctly serialized and de-serialized with the new dedicated serializer and de-serializer.\r\n- sets are serialized using the built-in serializer instead of Kyro.\r\n\r\nSince serializer upgrade test requires at least one previous release to test the upgrade of set serializers (which does not exist yet), I'll postpone adding the upgrade test for set serializer after the release of v1.20.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (**yes** / no / don't know) \r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAllow connector classes to depend on internal Flink util classes in ArchUnit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Added internal classes in `flink.util` as allowed dependencies of Connector classes in ArchUnit Rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage, tested manually.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-26T08:46:02Z","updated_at":"2024-05-28T22:37:40Z","closed_at":"2024-05-28T22:37:40Z","merged_at":"2024-05-28T22:37:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"b1025e66e7b13bce6a6407544420dc494cd5e1b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1278805855,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4ODA1ODU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TestInfrastructure","name":"component=TestInfrastructure","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24843/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24843/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24843/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/30333f902e3449367bcf3317ab5ecde7ee4e9415","head":{"label":"vahmed-hamdy:flink-35454-archtests-fix","ref":"flink-35454-archtests-fix","sha":"30333f902e3449367bcf3317ab5ecde7ee4e9415","user":{"login":"vahmed-hamdy","id":94389402,"node_id":"U_kgDOBaBEmg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94389402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy","html_url":"https://github.com/vahmed-hamdy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":431601747,"node_id":"R_kgDOGbm4Uw","name":"flink","full_name":"vahmed-hamdy/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vahmed-hamdy","id":94389402,"node_id":"U_kgDOBaBEmg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94389402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy","html_url":"https://github.com/vahmed-hamdy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahmed-hamdy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vahmed-hamdy/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nStreamReader Charset fix with UTF8 in core files\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nStreamReader Charset fix with UTF8 in core files\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFlink sql gettingstarted Expression 'dept_id' is not being grouped\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/102840730/cfdf7c91-d11b-4dc4-a217-693ad04faeff)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/102840730/ccbf45be-cc26-4c0d-8505-9b1512e0ef3a)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *More accurate document content*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSee FLINK-35446. It seems the file merging is disabled, thus the `FileMergingSnapshotManagerBase#initFileSystem` is never called. And at this time if we restore from a checkpoint that files are already merged, the managed path is needed while it has not been initialized. This PR fix this.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Skip using managed directory to claim management of files if it is not initialized, which means no management need to be claimed in this case.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework without any test coverage. But some github actions may fail like FLINK-35446.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImplementation of [FLIP-451](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-451%3A+Introduce+timeout+configuration+to+AsyncSink+API) introducing Timeout Configuration to Async Sink.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add `ResultHandler` class to be used by Sink implementers\r\n- Add `AsyncSinkWriterResultHandler` implementation that supports timeout\r\n- Add `requestTimeoutMs` and `failOnTimeout` configuration to `AsyncSinkWriterConfiguration` and to `AsyncSinkWriterConfigurationBuilder`\r\n- Add default values to `requestTimeoutMs` and `failOnTimeout` as suggested in FLIP-451\r\n- Add needed unit tests and refactored existing tests\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added unit tests\r\n- Performed Sanity testing and benchmarks on Kinesis Implementation as described in the [Ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-35435).\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd the demo from [FLINK-34954](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-34954) as a test to prevent this bug happens in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- [FLINK-35215][core] Add a test for deserializing an object whose serialization result is an empty byte array\r\n- Added the NoFetchingInputTest#testDeserializeEmptyObject\r\n\r\nThis test will be failed when I remove following code inside of `NoFetchingInput#readBytes`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        if (count == 0) {\r\n

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, when there is a state request finished, a callback will be wrapped into a mail and inserted into the `Mailbox`. This PR put a batch of consecutive callbacks into one mail and execute them in batch, which reduce the interaction with the queue of mailbox. Additionally, the new introduced runner propagate the flag `hasMail`, which is essential for fine-grained scheduling of `AsyncExecutionController` (will exposed in later PR).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Introduce `BatchCallbackRunner` that receives single callbacks and run them in batch.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests on `AEC`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, the DynamicFilteringDataCollector is utilized in the dynamic partition pruning feature of batch jobs to collect the partition information dynamically filtered by the source. Its current data distribution method is rebalance, and it also acts as an upstream vertex to the probe side Source.\r\n\r\nPresently, when the Scheduler dynamically infers the parallelism for vertices that are both downstream and Source, it considers factors from both sides, which can lead to an overestimation of parallelism due to DynamicFilteringDataCollector being an upstream of the Source. We aim to change the distribution method of the DynamicFilteringDataCollector to broadcast to prevent the dynamic overestimation of Source parallelism.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, given that the DynamicFilteringDataCollector transmits data through the OperatorCoordinator rather than through normal data distribution, this change will not affect the DPP (Dynamic Partition Pruning) functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Change the distribution of DynamicFilteringDataCollector to Broadcast*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\nAnd I have verfiied it with TPC-DS, the result meets expectations.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no )\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no )\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?
