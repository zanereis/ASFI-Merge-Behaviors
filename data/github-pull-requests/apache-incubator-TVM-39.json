found that, using MS evo search + `RewriteLayout` + `link-params=True`, where the latter combination is supported by https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12991 and https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12949, is currently broken for the following reasons:\r\n* The manual NDArray rewriting via `IndexMap::MapNDArray` is slow\r\n* `IndexMap::MapNDArray` is called more than thousands of times during evo search **per iteration**,  by the following call sequence:\r\n \r\n`AssembleCandidates`\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/6780c9f87db6620409f8f58c2c2925c7bd7b6681/src/meta_schedule/search_strategy/evolutionary_search.cc#L206-L209 \r\n\r\n-> `ArgInfo::FromEntryFun`\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/111169c7df2831ab8ee40d5388ebcfcf551fd86f/src/meta_schedule/arg_info.cc#L104-L107\r\n\r\n-> `RemoveWeightLayoutRewriteBlock`\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/189338c919c0876cf5909b99fb125ee2a7fbe2c6/src/tir/transforms/remove_weight_layout_rewrite_block.cc#L163-L167\r\n\r\n-> `MapNDArray`\r\n\r\nSo what happens right now is that evo search + `link-params=True` would make tuning appear hanged, while it is busy doing thousands of `MapNDArray` in `AssembleCandidates`.\r\n\r\nMy proposed workaround for this problem is based on the observation that, when `RemoveWeightLayoutRewriteBlock` is called by `FromEntryFun` during evo search, the actual content of NDArray before and after rewrite does not matter. So we don't have to use `MapNDArray` during tuning. \r\n\r\nTo enable skipping such \"exact\" NDArray rewrite, I'm introducing a flag to `RemoveWeightLayoutRewriteBlock`. The exact rewrite by `MapNDArray` is only required when the pass is called from TECompiler during the final compilation.","created_at":"2022-10-12T11:26:46Z","updated_at":"2022-10-12T17:48:25Z","closed_at":"2022-10-12T17:48:22Z","merged_at":"2022-10-12T17:48:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"256075566b72e9c7ab42b3a82c58c0ee1960d731","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13052/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13052/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13052/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/02da79ee3160c50354f2041204392ed270d6a384","head":{"label":"masahi:remove-weight-rewrite-block-faster","ref":"remove-weight-rewrite-block-faster","sha":"02da79ee3160c50354f2041204392ed270d6a384","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":138661036,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzg2NjEwMzY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"masahi/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/masahi/tvm","description":"Open

pull request contains two changes:\r\n\r\n1. Adds support for specifying an `out_layout` to the `Tensordot`-based convolution schedules for Arm Cortex-M. This is useful, as when compiling models like MobileNetV1, we will want to alternate between NHWC and NCHW layers (see [this comment](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12969#issuecomment-1268113822) for more). \r\n\r\n2. Re-organizes the Corstone300 tests for regular, grouped, and depthwise conv2d to use a shared base class. This removes a lot of code re-use that used to exist in `tests/python/relay/strategy/arm_cpu`.\r\n\r\nI chose to make these changes as one PR instead of two, since I had to change some of the testing logic to support the `out_layout` parameter (and copying that into four places would be kinda gross).

MS uses `StructuralEqual/Hash` in task extraction / evo search / database. Sometimes, we want to use different hashing and equality testing methods, for example (1) to ignore NDArray (https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12706) or (2) to enable anchor-op only tuning (identify `conv2d` and `conv2d -> add` subgraphs as equal). \r\n\r\nTo enable such flexibility, this PR consolidate raw calls to `StructuralEqual/Hash` into one place, which for now is named `ModuleEquality`. Since hashing is also done for equality testing, I think it is appropriate to call the component responsible for hashing / equality test that way. But other suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\nImportantly, task extraction and database are now using the same hashing / equal method based on TIR mod, while previously task extraction was using a cache key-ed on relay mod.    \r\n\r\ncc @junrushao @zxybazh @tqchen

`tvm::arith::NarrowPredicateExpression`, a utility that removes free parameters from a boolean expression, such that the resulting expression being true implies that the original expression is true.  For example, the predicate `(0 <= i+f) && (i+f < 16)`, where `f` is a free parameter on the range `0 <= f < 2)`, can be narrowed to the expression `(0 <= i+0) && (i+2 < 16)`.\r\n\r\nIn effect, `NarrowPredicateExpression` functions as a context-sentive `tvm::tir::Substitute`, where the value substituted is selected such that the resulting expression errs on the side of being false.  This is an internal utility used as part of the simplifications for layout transformations ([tracking issue

the number of `async_commit_queue_scope` attributes --- `2` in the example.\r\n\r\nThis enables multiple input async DMA using the same queue / stage on Hexagon where before it was blocked due to the fact that \"in flight\" counts are managed for each individual DMA with no way to determine if a group of DMAs has completed.","created_at":"2022-10-11T16:34:12Z","updated_at":"2022-10-13T15:03:35Z","closed_at":"2022-10-13T01:52:08Z","merged_at":"2022-10-13T01:52:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"61c9742ea79d0057290502379a81a5487c77790d","assignee":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13037/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13037/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13037/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/24c01e74ab94a540afdce80649c243190c7b70ed","head":{"label":"adstraw:straw-hexagon-multi-input-async-dma","ref":"straw-hexagon-multi-input-async-dma","sha":"24c01e74ab94a540afdce80649c243190c7b70ed","user":{"login":"adstraw","id":26910851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTEwODUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26910851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw","html_url":"https://github.com/adstraw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":395474271,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTU0NzQyNzE=","name":"tvm","full_name":"adstraw/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"adstraw","id":26910851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTEwODUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26910851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw","html_url":"https://github.com/adstraw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adstraw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/adstraw/tvm","description":"Open

this PR ported the rolling_buffer primitive from TE schedule to TensorIR schedule, refer to [[RFC] Introducing a ‘rolling_buffer’ scheduling primitive](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-introducing-a-rolling-buffer-scheduling-primitive/9836).\r\nThe primitive performs the following steps to transform the target buffer into a 'rolling buffer':\r\n1. Collect bound overlaps on the target buffer, and select the outermost rollable axis appeared in the block's loop nest as the 'rolling axis'.\r\n2. Append block predicate to the producer block of the target buffer to avoid recomputation.\r\n3.

to this commit, the result of TryCompare would only be used if it could definitively prove a conditional to be either true or false. For example, if it is known that `0 <= i`, a conditional of `i <= 0` would be left as-is.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces rewrite rules to preferentially simplify into more restrictive conditions.  Using the same example, if it is known that `0 <= i`, a conditional of `i <= 0` would be simplified into `i == 0`.  Similarly, if it is known that `0 <= i`, a conditional of `i != 0` would be simplified into `0 < i`.\r\n\r\nBecause this change does not introduce significant overhead, as the results of `RewriteSimplifier::Impl::TryCompare` are already available, this change is enabled for all use cases and does not require a call to `RewriteSimplifier::SetEnabledExtensions`.","created_at":"2022-10-10T15:30:33Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T18:02:56Z","closed_at":"2022-11-04T15:28:21Z","merged_at":"2022-11-04T15:28:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"ccb7d07159fdcc52f8a04e28afe3d7caac3cf829","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13024/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13024/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13024/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/507c1c517344bc52f4cfe3fa009abe312ca89a36","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:partially_prove_inequalities","ref":"partially_prove_inequalities","sha":"507c1c517344bc52f4cfe3fa009abe312ca89a36","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

the checks for a literal constraint would find exact matches for an inequality, but any alterations to the conditional would break this exact matching.  This commit introduces checks for constant offsets relative to a known value.  These checks are not always expressible using the existing `ConstIntSetAnalyzer`, which represents allowed values using a single contiguous region.  (e.g. `i!=5` is not representable, because it requires a region for `i<5` and another for `i>5`.)\r\n\r\nThis implementation reuses the internal representation for inequalities introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12863, along with much of its implementation.  However, the indirect comparisons (e.g. using `a < b` and `b < c` to prove that `a < c`) introduced in that PR still require an explicit flag to be used.","created_at":"2022-10-10T15:23:40Z","updated_at":"2022-10-31T13:21:51Z","closed_at":"2022-10-29T17:55:55Z","merged_at":"2022-10-29T17:55:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"25a0d47d2b55f3404ea711a3ff28bf22f7cc0e17","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13023/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13023/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13023/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/bb2f4ed9b21044054e58e528f8f5ceb6c338c276","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:use_direct_comparisons_to_prove_statements","ref":"use_direct_comparisons_to_prove_statements","sha":"bb2f4ed9b21044054e58e528f8f5ceb6c338c276","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

InjectRollingBuffer pass seems to miscalculate rolling_buffer strides when the bound overlap is large and fractional strides exist.\r\nThe original test case `test_upscale` does not expose this problem because there is no positive bound overlap in the intermediate buffer, so I modified the pass and the test case as well.\r\n\r\nTo clarify this change, here is an example:\r\n```\r\n    @T.prim_func\r\n    def pool_1d_upscale(a: T.handle, c: T.handle) -> None:\r\n        # function attr dict\r\n        T.func_attr({\"from_legacy_te_schedule\": True, \"global_symbol\": \"pool_1d_upscale\", \"tir.noalias\": True})\r\n\r\n        B = T.buffer_decl([1, 14], dtype=\"int8\")\r\n        # B = T.match_buffer(b,  [1, 14], dtype=\"int8\")\r\n        A = T.match_buffer(a,  [1, 14], dtype=\"int8\")\r\n        C = T.match_buffer(c,  [1, 24], dtype=\"int8\")\r\n        T.realize(C[0:1, 0:24], \"\")\r\n        for ax0_outer in T.serial(0, 5):\r\n            T.realize(B[0:1, T.floordiv(ax0_outer*5, 2): T.floordiv(ax0_outer*5, 2) + 5], \"\")\r\n            T.attr(B, \"rolling_buffer_scope\", True)\r\n            for ax0 in T.serial(0, 5):\r\n                if T.likely(((T.floordiv(ax0_outer * 5, 2) + ax0) < 14), dtype='bool'):\r\n                    B[0, (T.floordiv(ax0_outer * 5, 2) + ax0)] = A[0, (T.floordiv(ax0_outer * 5, 2) + ax0)]\r\n            for ax0_1 in T.serial(0, 5):\r\n                for rv0 in T.serial(0, 3):\r\n                    if T.likely(((ax0_outer * 5 + ax0_1) < 24), dtype='bool'):\r\n                        C[0, (ax0_outer * 5 + ax0_1)] = T.max(C[0, (ax0_outer * 5) + ax0_1], B[0, (T.floordiv((ax0_outer * 5) + ax0_1, 2) + rv0)])\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe rolling_buffer stride computed at `inject_rolling_buffer.cc:137` would always be overwritten by the assignment on `inject_rolling_buffer.cc:156`, leat to bound_overlaps to be computed as {0, 0}.\r\nAfter pass InjectRollingBuffer, the IR becomes as below, each overlapping element is recomputed.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @T.prim_func\r\n    def pool_1d_upscale(A: T.Buffer[(1, 14), \"int8\"], C: T.Buffer[(1, 24), \"int8\"]) -> None:\r\n        # function attr dict\r\n        T.func_attr({\"from_legacy_te_schedule\": True, \"global_symbol\": \"pool_1d_upscale\", \"tir.noalias\": True})\r\n        # buffer definition\r\n        B = T.buffer_decl([1, 14], dtype=\"int8\")\r\n        # body\r\n        T.realize(C[0:1, 0:24], \"\")\r\n        T.realize(B[0:1, 0:5], \"\")\r\n        for ax0_outer in T.serial(5):\r\n            for ax0 in T.serial(5):\r\n                if T.likely(ax0_outer * 5 // 2 + ax0 < 14, dtype=\"bool\"):\r\n                    B[0, (ax0_outer * 5 // 2 + ax0) % 5] = A[0, ax0_outer * 5 // 2 + ax0]\r\n            for ax0_1, rv0 in T.grid(5, 3):\r\n                if T.likely(ax0_outer * 5 + ax0_1 < 24, dtype=\"bool\"):\r\n                    C[0, ax0_outer * 5 + ax0_1] = T.max(C[0, ax0_outer * 5 + ax0_1], B[0, ((ax0_outer * 5 + ax0_1) // 2 + rv0) % 5])\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter my modifications , the bound_overlaps would be correctly computed as {0, 2}, the IR becomes as below, which avoids recomputing some elements.\r\n\r\n```\r\n

we use `StructuralEqual/Hash`, the actual equality testing / hashing work are deferred to `RemapVarSEqualHandler` and `VarCountingSHashHandler` class respectively, defined in `.cc` files. To customize equality / hash behavior, I want to be able to derive from these classes outside of `structural_equal.cc` or `structural_hash.cc`. This is the first step toward replacing my previous attempt https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12706 to allow ignoring NDArray raw data in `StructuralEqual/Hash`.\r\n\r\nSo I propose to expose them as the \"default\" handler, while still hiding their implementation details. This lets me define a custom hasher that ignores NDArray content simply by:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass SHashHandlerIgnoreNDArray : public SHashHandlerDefault {\r\n protected:\r\n  void DispatchSHash(const ObjectRef& object, bool map_free_vars) override {\r\n    ICHECK(object.defined());\r\n    if (auto ndarray = object.as<runtime::NDArray::Container>()) {\r\n      SHashReducer hash_reduce(this,

`T.bool` could be used to define a boolean value (e.g. `b = T.bool(1)`), but required using `T.boolean` when writing a type annotation.  This can cause both user confusion, as all other TVMScript type annotations directly match their string representation in `tvm.runtime.DataType`, and failure to roundtrip, because the tvmscript printer will generate the non-existence `T.bool` type annotations.\r\n\r\nThis commit add `tvm.script.tir.ty.bool`, which can be used in TVMScript as `T.bool`. The previous\r\n`tvm.script.tir.ty.boolean` (`T.boolean` in TVMScript) is maintained for backwards compatibility.","created_at":"2022-10-03T21:34:56Z","updated_at":"2022-10-06T15:49:51Z","closed_at":"2022-10-06T07:12:41Z","merged_at":"2022-10-06T07:12:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"2d50979606a664f01d73d986be7562c5c2f8cd7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12975/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12975/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/12975/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/184e81ca2133e4b7051bd9d2d6a3bff33a93f5c9","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:tvmscript_bool_type_annotation","ref":"tvmscript_bool_type_annotation","sha":"184e81ca2133e4b7051bd9d2d6a3bff33a93f5c9","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

is done by instrumenting the code with profiling builtin calls using a TIR pass. During codegen, these builtin calls are replaced with the calls to a hexagon specific handler which records the runtime information into a buffer. This buffer is written into a JSON file ('lwp.json') which is processed to construct function and loop-level profiling information as a csv file.\r\n\r\nAt a high-level, this PR makes the following changes:\r\n\r\n1) Add a TIR pass (src/tir/transforms/profile_instrumentation.cc) to instrument the functions and loops with profilging builtins.\r\n2) Hexagon codegen changes to replace profilng builtin calls with the call to Hexagon specific handler. This handler records the runtime data into a buffer. For all other targets, these builtin calls are ignored.\r\n3) Add API to RPC Launcher to get the profiling data as a JSON file\r\n4) Add a python script (python/tvm/contrib/hexagon/profiling/process_lwp_data.py) to process the profiling data and construct a CSV file\r\n5) Add TVM script based unit tests to test and demonstrate various profiling config

pull request adds fast microTVM DSP schedules for the optimal (for Cortex-M) `conv2d` and `depthwise_conv2d` layouts - `NHWC/OHWI` and `NCHW/OIHW`, respectively. By letting us use the special `SMLAD` DSP instruction without rearranging data, **25%** of the instructions in the inner loop can be removed (for the `int16` case).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this change allows both the `conv2d` and `depthwise_conv2d` fast DSP schedules to use the same underlying intrinsic, a variation of a tensordot operator. This makes the code for these schedules much more compact. This PR also:\r\n\r\n- Adds unit tests for the new schedules\r\n- Does not affect the old schedules, which are still used when they apply\r\n  - The cases in which these new fast schedules apply are strictly different\r\n- Adds support for `int8`, `int16`, and `int32` input data types in the new schedules\r\n- Adds a `change_constant_shape` utility to `tvm.topi`\r\n\r\nI've also written a comment below delving into why these layouts are optimal.","created_at":"2022-10-03T12:46:18Z","updated_at":"2022-10-11T08:07:21Z","closed_at":"2022-10-11T08:07:21Z","merged_at":"2022-10-11T08:07:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"fcbcd156c7dd995b24b363dbddca5a8766648693","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12969/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12969/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/12969/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/1966533449919b356e2178ecf1c4bc86e3bb396a","head":{"label":"guberti:micro/tensordot","ref":"micro/tensordot","sha":"1966533449919b356e2178ecf1c4bc86e3bb396a","user":{"login":"guberti","id":3069006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjkwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3069006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti","html_url":"https://github.com/guberti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":371518634,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzE1MTg2MzQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"guberti/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guberti","id":3069006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjkwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3069006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti","html_url":"https://github.com/guberti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guberti/tvm","description":"Open

PR introduces a validation script to check result accuracy between the scheduled IRModules and original IRModule stored in MetaSchedule database. The validate function could also be reused for other type of databases in MetaSchedule. The result would be printed out on the screen as validation passed or failed at some records.\r\n\r\nCC @junrushao\r\n\r\nWhen running checks the expected output looks like:\r\n```bash\r\nProgress      1 /   1003 checked.\r\nProgress      2 /   1003 checked.\r\nProgress      3 /   1003 checked.\r\nProgress      4 /   1003 checked.\r\nProgress      5 /   1003 checked.\r\n...\r\n```\r\nIf everything runs well, the script will print out a `Validation passed!` in the end.\r\nIf there's any unexpected error or unmatched results, it will print out the IRModules, inputs or exceptions.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nProgress     74 /   1003 checked.\r\nValidation failed!\r\n\r\nOriginal Result:\r\n------------------------------\r\n[array([[[[0.5871589 , 0.47408924, 0.60046124, ...,

rewrites of boolean expressions were handled directly within `RewriteSimplifier` visitors.  This commit extracts the handling of `And`, `Or`, and `Not` nodes into an independent internal utility.  The `RewriteBooleanOperators` utility can simplifies these nodes, assuming that the arguments to these expressions are already simplified.  (e.g. Finding the negation of `(a < b)` without needing to recurse into `a` or `b`.)  This will be used as part of additional simplifications required by [buffer layout\r\npadding](https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/12261).\r\n\r\nBecause no external functionality should be added or

upgrade introduced a import of xgboost in meta_schedule, removed in current version by using a function to return the call back class.\r\n\r\nWe've recently introduced a XGBoost Model upgrade to support new xgboost version of callback class in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12141. However, in this PR it uses a function called `optional_xgboost_callback` that works to avoid compatibility issue (xgboost 1.5.2 v.s. 1.6.0). In this specific function, it tries to import the newly introduced xgboost callback class and create a new class using it as base class. This actually imported xgboost when meta_schedule is imported, which is not ideal because xgboost is not a dependency of tvm and meta_schedule, it should only be required when xgboost cost model is employed. This PR fixes the problem by moving the class and the function mentioened above under a function that returns this class when needed. In this way we avoided unwanted import of xgboost in meta_schedule.\r\n\r\nCC @shingjan @junrushao
