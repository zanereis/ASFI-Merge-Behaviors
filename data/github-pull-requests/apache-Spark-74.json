for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis change implements `SESSION_USER` expression. It behaves exactly the same as `CURRENT_USER` but according to standard when respective function is used inside a routine (UDF):\r\n- `CURRENT_USER` should return security definer, i.e. owner of an UDF\r\n- `SESSION_USER` should return connected user.\r\n\r\nThe code is duplicated for this reason - to be able to identify which expression is used inside a routing. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a missing expression defined by SQL standard.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, this change introduces a new expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdating existing unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`SparkSession.Builder` now applies configuration options to the create `SparkSession`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to expect PySpark connect `SparkSession.Builder` to behave in the same way as other `SparkSession.Builder`s in Spark Connect. The `SparkSession.Builder` should apply the provided configuration options to the created `SparkSesssion`. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTests were added to verify that configuration options were applied to the

needed?\r\n\r\nRun a Spark job and open the Spark Worker UI, http://localhost:8081 .\r\n```\r\n$ sbin/start-master.sh\r\n$ sbin/start-worker.sh spark://127.0.0.1:7077\r\n$ bin/spark-shell --master

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Snowflake a BOOLEAN data type exist but not the BIT data type.\r\nThis PR adds `SnowflakeDialect` to override the default JdbcDialect and redefine the default mapping behaviour for the _boolean_ type.  Currently, it's mapped to `BIT(1)` type.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/a663c0bf0c5b104170c0612f37a0b0cdf75cd45b/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/jdbc/JdbcUtils.scala#L149\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe BIT type does not exist in Snowflake.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `Driver Log` UI in order to provide a better UX like `Standalone Cluster`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Since Apache Spark 3.0.0, Spark History Server supports driver logs via `spark.driver.log.persistToDfs.enabled` and `spark.driver.log.dfsDir`.\r\n- For Apache Spark 4.0.0, this PR aims to support `Live Driver Log UI` page in Spark Driver UI (port 4040) via `spark.driver.log.localDir`. It means we can see the live driver log like the following via UI.\r\n\r\n\r\n**SPARK-SHELL**\r\n```\r\n$ bin/spark-shell -c spark.driver.log.localDir=/tmp/logs\r\n```\r\n![Screenshot 2023-08-21 at 4

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to change the way that python `datetime.timedelta` objects are converted to `pyspark.sql.types.DayTimeIntervalType` objects. Specifically, it modifies the logic inside `toInternal` which returns the timedelta as a python integer (would be int64 in other languages) storing the timedelta as microseconds. The current logic inadvertently adds an extra second when doing the conversion for certain python timedelta objects, thereby returning an incorrect value.\r\n\r\nAn illustrative example is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom datetime import timedelta\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import DayTimeIntervalType, StructField, StructType\r\n\r\nspark = ...spark session setup here...\r\n\r\ntd = timedelta(days=4498031, seconds=16054, microseconds=999981)\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame([(td,)], StructType([StructField(name=\"timedelta_col\", dataType=DayTimeIntervalType(), nullable=False)]))\r\ndf.show(truncate=False)\r\n\r\n> +------------------------------------------------+\r\n> |timedelta_col                                   | \r\n> +------------------------------------------------+ \r\n> |INTERVAL '4498031 04:27:35.999981' DAY TO SECOND| \r\n> +------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nprint(str(td))\r\n\r\n>  '4498031 days, 4:27:34.999981' \r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example, look at the seconds. The original python timedelta object has 34 seconds, the pyspark DayTimeIntervalType column has 35 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix a bug. It is a bug because the wrong value is returned after conversion. Adding the above timedelta entry to existing unit tests causes the test to fail.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Users should now see the correct timedelta values in pyspark dataframes for similar such edge cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIllustrative edge case examples were added to the unit test (`python/pyspark/sql/tests/test_types.py` the `test_daytime_interval_type` test), verified that the existing code failed the test, new code was added, and verified that the unit test now passes.\r\n\r\n### JIRA ticket link\r\nThis PR should close

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplement a heartbeat for spark connect. This works by maintaining the number of open queries and sending \"keep-alive\" requests from a separate thread if at least one such query is running\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe notice that clients who wish to execute long requests (specifically this happens to ExecutePlanRequests taking 1 hour or more), often face disconnects by intermediate proxy layers, such as those in common cloud providers. Apparently more standard ways to resolve this such as grpc's heartbeat don't help.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis change proposes to enable heartbeat by default\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUT and E2E coverage. It was also separately verified that 1 hour 10 min query worked fine, i.e.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest(\"Alice\") {\r\n    val n: Long = 80e13.toLong\r\n\r\n    val res = spark.range(n).count()\r\n\r\n

n)\r\n}\r\n```","created_at":"2023-08-17T14:54:48Z","updated_at":"2023-11-27T00:19:03Z","closed_at":"2023-11-27T00:19:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f63d978e74f8a82b0186353956a6bcd132db04d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42538/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42538/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42538/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2256b64c0a0d820f0d3430c497916e08bbc18610","head":{"label":"cdkrot:scala_heartbeat","ref":"scala_heartbeat","sha":"2256b64c0a0d820f0d3430c497916e08bbc18610","user":{"login":"cdkrot","id":5040764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDA3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5040764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot","html_url":"https://github.com/cdkrot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":659205820,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ0quvA","name":"apache_spark","full_name":"cdkrot/apache_spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cdkrot","id":5040764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDA3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5040764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot","html_url":"https://github.com/cdkrot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cdkrot/apache_spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis will prevent driver from scheduling new tasks on these executors, they will also migrate any shuffle data they wrote.\r\nMigration of shuffle data written by executors which are removed by Spark because they are no longer needed is not handled.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis removes containers from DECOMMISSIONING YARN nodes hence node can be removed from cluster.

tested?\r\nTested manually by running on a cluster with YARN and manually putting a node in DECOMMISSIONING

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to use the `DateFormatClass` expression for formatting a datetime expression to string in the `to_char`/`to_varchar` functions, and the `ToCharacter` expression in other cases.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo achieve feature parity with other systems, and make the migration from them eaiser:\r\n- Snowflake: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/to_char\r\n- PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-formatting.html\r\n- MariaDB: https://mariadb.com/kb/en/to_char/\r\n- DB2: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=sf-char\r\n- Exasol: https://docs.exasol.com/db/latest/sql_references/functions/alphabeticallistfunctions/to_char%20(datetime).htm\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, but it can if an user's query depends on errors from `to_char`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPreviously, if a view's schema contains a nested struct, alterTable using Hive client will fail. This change supports a view with a nested struct. The mechanism is to store an empty schema when we call Hive client, since we already store the actual schema in table properties. This fix is similar to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37364\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis supports using view with nested structs in Hive metastore. \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit test.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-17T10:04:47Z","updated_at":"2023-08-18T18:07:29Z","closed_at":"2023-08-18T18:07:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8120c91384638d777a3088bd17ade7c402510eea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42532/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42532/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42532/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/21c0a64ee3aed77119a6eb49dcf12da7e2263544","head":{"label":"kylerong-db:hive_view","ref":"hive_view","sha":"21c0a64ee3aed77119a6eb49dcf12da7e2263544","user":{"login":"kylerong-db","id":110418823,"node_id":"U_kgDOBpTbhw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110418823?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db","html_url":"https://github.com/kylerong-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":679622294,"node_id":"R_kgDOKII2lg","name":"spark","full_name":"kylerong-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kylerong-db","id":110418823,"node_id":"U_kgDOBpTbhw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110418823?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db","html_url":"https://github.com/kylerong-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerong-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kylerong-db/spark","description":"Apache

In rule `RemoveRedundantAggregates`, if trigger remove redundant aggregates, then do `PullOutGroupingExpressions` to pull out complex grouping expressions to a `Project` node under an `Aggregate`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe aggregate contains complex grouping expressions after `RemoveRedundantAggregates`, if `aggregateExpressions` has (if / case) branches, it is possible that `groupingExpressions` is no longer a subexpression of `aggregateExpressions` after execute `PushFoldableIntoBranches` rule, Then cause `boundReference` error.\r\nFor example\r\n```\r\nSELECT c * 2 AS d\r\nFROM (\r\n         SELECT if(b > 1, 1, b) AS c\r\n         FROM (\r\n                  SELECT if(a < 0, 0, a) AS b\r\n                  FROM VALUES (-1), (1), (2) AS t1(a)\r\n              ) t2\r\n         GROUP BY b\r\n     ) t3\r\nGROUP BY c\r\n```\r\nBefore pr\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nAggregate [if ((b#0 > 1)) 1 else b#0], [if ((b#0 >

The specific reason is that in the last pr, different URIs of user information are also regarded as different file systems. Uri.getauthority is used to determine the user information, but authority contains the host so the URI above must be different from authority. To determine whether the user authentication information is different, you only need to determine URI.getUserInfo.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nthe last pr and issue link:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22587\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19885\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImprove the error message for `ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN` command on partition columns.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, if a user executes `ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN` on a partition column, the error message provided is cryptic and does not help users. The improved error message makes it clear that the command is not supported for partition columns.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNew output when the command is executed on a partition column.\r\n\r\n> `org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: [CANNOT_ALTER_PARTITION_COLUMN]

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark Connect has the following types of integration tests:\r\n* Client unit tests with a mock in process server (DummySparkConnectService with GRPC InProcessServerBuilder)\r\n* Client unit tests with a mock RPC server (DummySparkConnectService with GRPC NettyServerBuilder)\r\n* Server unit tests with in-process server and using various mocks\r\n* E2E tests of real client with a server started in another process (using RemoteSparkSession)\r\n\r\nWhat is lacking are E2E tests with an in-process Server (so that server state can be inspected asserted), and a real RPC client. This is impossible, because classes from `spark-connect-client-jvm` module include the client API which duplicates Spark SQL APIs of SparkSession, Dataset etc. When trying to pull a real client into the server module for testing, these classes clash.\r\n\r\nMove the `org.apache.spark.sql.connect.client` code into `spark-connect-common` module, so that the internal SparkConnectClient code is separated from the client public API, and can be pulled into testing of the server. The only class that we keep in `spark-connect-client-jvm` is `AmmoniteClassFinder`, to avoid pulling in ammonite dependency into common.\r\n\r\nTried alternative approach in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42465. That doesn't work, because it also reorders the maven build in a way so that client is build before server, but client actually requires server to be build first to use tests with `RemoteSparkSession`\r\nTried alternative approach to depend on a shaded/relocated version of client in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42461, but that's just not possible to do neither in maven nor sbt.\r\nTried alternative approach to create client-jvm-internal module in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42441, moving things to connect-common was preferred to introducing new module by reviewers.\r\nMoved it together with tests in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42501, but moving tests isn't really needed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor being able to use the internal client for testing of in-process server with an in-process client, but communicating over real RPC.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAll modules test and build.","created_at":"2023-08-16T22:09:14Z","updated_at":"2023-08-17T15:06:15Z","closed_at":"2023-08-17T15:06:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7c7f5fec369c1c68ccfdaef332b1732398414eb8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42523/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42523/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42523/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/44b662724a691ba83c2eb3a035f382fe6e8da3d0","head":{"label":"juliuszsompolski:sc-client-common-mainonly","ref":"sc-client-common-mainonly","sha":"44b662724a691ba83c2eb3a035f382fe6e8da3d0","user":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82301030,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjMwMTAzMA==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR changes the default determinism of Python UDTFs from `True` to `False`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo prevent potential regressions as many Python UDTFs are often used as non-deterministic UDTFs. Users can always mark them as deterministic.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. Python UDTF is a new feature that is not yet released.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting and new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR cleans up the Maven build for the Spark Connect Client and Spark Connect Common. The most important change is that we move `sql-api` from a `provided` to `compile` dependency. The net effect of this is that when a user takes a dependency on the client, all of its required (transitive) dependencies are automatically added.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this does not address concerns around creating an überjar and shading. That is for a different day :)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen you take a dependency on the connect scala client you need to manually add the `sql-api` module as a dependency.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR exposes `SparkConnectClient`'s `artifactManager.uploadAllArtifactClasses` to `sql` package. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, UDF classfiles are uploaded in all analyze/execute operations. However, if codepath used to call Scala UDF bypasses we'll need to manually call this method to make sure that all classfiles are uploaded\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo tests needed - this PR only exposes a method to sql

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR add `ammoniteOut.reset()` in the `afterEach` method of `ReplE2ESuite` to ensure that the 'output' used for assertions in each test case is only related to the current case and not all content.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current `ammoniteOut` records the output content of all executed tests, without isolating between cases. This can lead to unexpected assertion results. \r\nFor example, adding 'assertContains(\"\"\"String = \"[MyTestClass(1), MyTestClass(3)]\"\"\"\", output)' in the following test case would still pass the test because it is a result content printed to `ammoniteOut` in the previous test case. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/2be20e54a2222f6cdf64e8486d1910133b43665f/connector/connect/client/jvm/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/application/ReplE2ESuite.scala#L283-L290\r\n\r\nHence, we need to clear the content in `ammoniteOut` after each test to achieve isolation between test cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, just for test\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass Github Actions\r\n- Manual check\r\n\r\nPrints the `output` after `val output = runCommandsInShell(input)` in the the case `streaming works with REPL generated code`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/2be20e54a2222f6cdf64e8486d1910133b43665f/connector/connect/client/jvm/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/application/ReplE2ESuite.scala#L313-L318\r\n\r\nrun

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR add `ammoniteOut.reset()` in the `afterEach` method of `ReplE2ESuite` to ensure that the 'output' used for assertions in each test case is only related to the current case and not all content.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current `ammoniteOut` records the output content of all executed tests, without isolating between cases. This can lead to unexpected assertion results. \r\nFor example, adding 'assertContains(\"\"\"String = \"[MyTestClass(1), MyTestClass(3)]\"\"\"\", output)' in the following test case would still pass the test because it is a result content printed to `ammoniteOut` in the previous test case. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/2be20e54a2222f6cdf64e8486d1910133b43665f/connector/connect/client/jvm/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/application/ReplE2ESuite.scala#L283-L290\r\n\r\nHence, we need to clear the content in `ammoniteOut` after each test to achieve isolation between test cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, just for test\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass Github Actions\r\n- Manual check\r\n\r\nPrints the `output` after `val output = runCommandsInShell(input)` in the the case `streaming works with REPL generated code`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/2be20e54a2222f6cdf64e8486d1910133b43665f/connector/connect/client/jvm/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/application/ReplE2ESuite.scala#L313-L318\r\n\r\nrun \r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"connect-client-jvm/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.application.ReplE2ESuite\" -Phive \r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before**: we can see the content of all test cases that have been

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix race for pending task kill issued before taskThread is initialized\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe see that there is a race for tasks that are interrupted through stage cancellation and that may be added to the TaskSet, but don't yet have taskThread initialized.\r\n\r\nBasically, we try to kill ongoing task attempts to handle stage cancellation\r\n\r\n```\r\n    logInfo(\"Cancelling stage \" + stageId)\r\n    // Kill all running tasks for the stage.\r\n    killAllTaskAttempts(stageId, interruptThread, reason = \"Stage cancelled: \" + reason)\r\n    // Cancel all attempts for the stage.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a chance that taskThread is not initialized yet and we only set the reasonIfKilled.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  def kill(interruptThread: Boolean, reason: String): Unit = {\r\n    require(reason != null)\r\n    _reasonIfKilled = reason\r\n    if (context != null) {\r\n      context.markInterrupted(reason)\r\n    }\r\n    if (interruptThread && taskThread != null) {\r\n      taskThread.interrupt().  <--- never hit\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen within the task execution thread itself, we try to call kill again since the reasonIfKilled is set. However, this time we pass interruptThread as false explicitly since we don't know the status of the previous call.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    taskThread = Thread.currentThread()\r\n\r\n    if (_reasonIfKilled != null) {\r\n      kill(interruptThread = false, _reasonIfKilled) <-- only context will be set, \r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe TaskReaper has also finished its previous and only attempt at task interruption since we don't try for multiple times in this case. Eventually, the task is not interrupted even once and it gets blocked on some I/O or wait calls which might not finish within the reaper timeout, leading to the JVM being killed.\r\n\r\n```\r\n        taskRunner.kill(interruptThread = interruptThread, reason = reason)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe change tries to fix this issue by checking for the presence of `reasonIfKilled` on the context and issuing a `TaskKilledException` before we execute `runTask` thereby preventing execution of the actual task and freeing up the slot and also preventing future issues with the reaper.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] JobCancellationSuite:\r\n...\r\n[info] Run completed in 35 seconds, 781 milliseconds.\r\n[info] Total number of tests run: 13\r\n[info] Suites: completed 1, aborted 0\r\n[info] Tests: succeeded 13, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0\r\n[info] All tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMy last PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41052 causes AVRO read performance regression since I change the code structure. I turn one match case into a nested match case. So I fix the Avro data type conversion issues in anther way to avoid this regression.\r\n\r\nOriginal Change: \r\nWe introduce the SQLConf `spark.sql.legacy.avro.allowReadingWithIncompatibleSchema` to prevent reading interval types as date or timestamp types to avoid getting corrupt dates as well as reading decimal types with incorrect precision.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe found the following issues with open source Avro:\r\n\r\n- Interval types can be read as date or timestamp types that would lead to wildly different results\r\n   For example, `Duration.ofDays(1).plusSeconds(1)` will be read as `1972-09-27`, which is weird.\r\n- Decimal types can be read with lower precision, that leads to data being read as `null` instead of suggesting that a wider decimal format should be provided\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nOld unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark Connect has the following types of integration tests:\r\n* Client unit tests with a mock in process server (DummySparkConnectService with GRPC InProcessServerBuilder)\r\n* Client unit tests with a mock RPC server (DummySparkConnectService with GRPC NettyServerBuilder)\r\n* Server unit tests with in-process server and using various mocks\r\n* E2E tests of real client with a server started in another process (using RemoteSparkSession)\r\n\r\nWhat is lacking are E2E tests with an in-process Server (so that server state can be inspected asserted), and a real RPC client. This is impossible, because classes from `spark-connect-client-jvm` module include the client API which duplicates Spark SQL APIs of SparkSession, Dataset etc. When trying to pull a real client into the server module for testing, these classes clash.\r\n\r\nMove the `org.apache.spark.sql.connect.client` code into new `spark-connect-client-jvm-internal` module, so that the internal SparkConnectClient code is separated from the client public API, and can be pulled into testing of the server.\r\n\r\nTried alternative approach in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42465. That doesn't work, because it also reorders the maven build in a way so that client is build before server, but client actually requires server to be build first to use tests with `RemoteSparkSession`\r\nTried alternative approach to depend on a shaded/relocated version of client in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42461, but that's just not possible to do neither in maven nor sbt.\r\nTried alternative approach to create client-jvm-internal module in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42441, moving things to connect-common was preferred to introducing new module by reviewers.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor being able to use the internal client for testing of in-process server with an in-process client, but communicating over real RPC.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAll modules test and build.\r\nI looked if more tests could be moved into jvm-internal, but most tests in the org.apache.spark.sql.client packages depend on the full client APIs

If it's unmatched, it picks the head blindly.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> assignee = asf_jira.user(\"yao\")\r\n>>> \"SPARK-44801\"\r\n'SPARK-44801'\r\n>>> asf_jira.assign_issue(issue.key, assignee.name)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nNameError: name 'issue' is not defined\r\n>>> asf_jira.assign_issue(\"SPARK-44801\", assignee.name)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/Users/hzyaoqin/python/lib/python3.11/site-packages/jira/client.py\", line 123, in wrapper\r\n    result = func(*arg_list, **kwargs)\r\n             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/Users/hzyaoqin/python/lib/python3.11/site-packages/jira/client.py\", line 1891, in assign_issue\r\n    self._session.put(url, data=json.dumps(payload))\r\n  File \"/Users/hzyaoqin/python/lib/python3.11/site-packages/requests/sessions.py\", line 649, in put\r\n    return self.request(\"PUT\", url, data=data, **kwargs)\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/Users/hzyaoqin/python/lib/python3.11/site-packages/jira/resilientsession.py\", line 246, in request\r\n    elif raise_on_error(response, **processed_kwargs):\r\n         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/Users/hzyaoqin/python/lib/python3.11/site-packages/jira/resilientsession.py\", line 71, in raise_on_error\r\n    raise JIRAError(\r\njira.exceptions.JIRAError: JiraError HTTP 400 url: https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/latest/issue/SPARK-44801/assignee\r\n\tresponse text = {\"errorMessages\":[],\"errors\":{\"assignee\":\"User 'airhot' cannot be assigned issues.\"}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Jira userid 'yao' fails to return my JIRA profile as a candidate(20 in total) to match.

the filter can not be pushed down through `EqualNullSafe` in optimizer rule `InferFiltersFromConstraints`. This can be fixed in method `ConstraintHelper.inferAdditionalConstraints`.\r\nFor 2nd SQL, after rules `InferFiltersFromConstraints` and `PushDownPredicates`, the filter can only be pushed to left side of join, so another `InferFiltersFromConstraints` is needed to push the filter to right side of join.\r\n\r\nFurther more, not all constraints can be inferred and once strategy idempotency may be broken for `InferFiltersFromConstraints` currently, this can be verified by new added test file `infer-filters.sql`. We can find that the strategy of rule `InferFiltersFromConstraints` should be changed to `fixedPoint` instead of `Once`, and the inferring logic in `ConstraintHelper.inferAdditionalConstraints` should be changed to an iteration over all constraints.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nHuge amount of data may be filtered before expensive join operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-15T07:22:14Z","updated_at":"2023-12-30T00:18:08Z","closed_at":"2023-12-30T00:18:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f407decf9e672749db1fdc0ed0febbd5302b7daf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42495/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42495/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42495/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d5dda7468853bd1463c2db2f3c2eac8fa704aa25","head":{"label":"copperybean:null-safe-push","ref":"null-safe-push","sha":"d5dda7468853bd1463c2db2f3c2eac8fa704aa25","user":{"login":"copperybean","id":2949045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDkwNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2949045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean","html_url":"https://github.com/copperybean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":368038213,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjgwMzgyMTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"copperybean/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"copperybean","id":2949045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDkwNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2949045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean","html_url":"https://github.com/copperybean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copperybean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/copperybean/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen you define a class in the REPL (with previously defines symbols), for example:\r\n```scala\r\nval filePath = \"my_path\"\r\ncase class MyTestClass(value: Int)\r\n```\r\nThis is actually declared inside a command class.In ammonite the structure looks like this:\r\n```scala\r\n// First command contains the `filePath`\r\nobject cmd1 {\r\n  val wrapper = new cmd1\r\n  val instance = new command.Helper\r\n}\r\nclass cmd1 extends Serializable {\r\n  class Helper extends Serializable {\r\n    val filePath = \"my_path\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Second contains the `MyTestClass` definition\r\nobject command2 {\r\n  val wrapper = new command2\r\n  val instance = new command.Helper\r\n}\r\nclass command2 extends Serializable {\r\n  @_root_.scala.transient private val __amm_usedThings = _root_.ammonite.repl.ReplBridge.value.usedEarlierDefinitions.iterator.toSet\r\n\r\n  private val `cmd1`: cmd1.instance.type = if (__amm_usedThings(\"\"\"cmd1\"\"\")) cmd1 else null.asInstanceOf[cmd1.instance.type]\r\n\r\n  class Helper extends Serializable {\r\n    case class MyTestClass(value: Int)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn order to create an instance of `MyTestClass` we need an instance of the `Helper`. When an instance of the class is created by Spark itself we use `OuterScopes` that - for Ammonite generated classes - accesses the command object to fetch the helper instance. The problem with this, is that the access triggers the creation of an instance of the command, when you create an instance of the command this tries to access the REPL to figure out which one of its dependents is in use (clever compiler trick), and this fails because we are not running the REPL on the driver or executor in connect.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by explicitly passing an getter for the outer instance to the `ProductEncoder`. For ammonite we actually ship the helper instance.  This way the encoder always carries the information it needs to create the class.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes a bug when you try to use a REPL defined class as the input of the UDF. For example this will work now:\r\n```scala\r\nval filePath = \"my_path\" // we need some previous cell that exposes a symbol that could be captured in the class definition.\r\ncase class MyTestClass(value: Int) {\r\n      override def toString: String = value.toString\r\n}\r\nspark.range(10).select(col(\"id\").cast(\"int\").as(\"value\")).as[MyTestClass].map(mtc => mtc.value).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test to `ReplE2ESuite` illustrate the

request?\r\n\r\nIn each partition, SortMergeJoin will compute one by one from the streamed side, so we could respect the streamed side ordering to remove unnecessary sort.\r\nFor example, when REQUIRE_ALL_CLUSTER_KEYS_FOR_CO_PARTITION is false:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM (\r\n    SELECT t1.*, row_number() over(partition by a order by b) rn\r\n    FROM values(1, 1) t1(a, b)\r\n)

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch makes it possible to perform checkpoints on RDD eagerly, the same way we currently do it for `Dataset` and `Dataframe`. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBeing able to perform the checkpoint eagerly is useful as it might sometime lead to less jobs when creating the checkpoint. That it useful it also indicating by the existence (and being the default) of the same API for Dataset.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it introduces a new overload for RDD.checkpoint that takes a boolean indicating whether the checkpoint should be done eagerly or not.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting and new unittests.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen you currently use a REPL generated class in a UDF you can get an error saying that that class is not equal to that class. This error is thrown in a code generated class. The problem is that the classes have been loaded by different classloaders. We cache generated code and use the textual code as the string. The problem with this is that in Spark Connect users are free in supplying user classes that can have arbitrary names, a name can point to an entirely different class, or it can point to the same class (in bytes) but loaded by a different classloader. We need to add the classloader to the key in the code gen cache to make this safe.\r\n\r\nThere are roughly two ways how this problem can arise:\r\n1. Two sessions use the same class names. This is particularly easy when you use the REPL because this  always generates the same names.\r\n2. You run in single process mode. In this case wholestage codegen will test compile the class using a different classloader then the 'executor', while sharing the same code generator cache.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want to be able to use REPL (and other)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI added a test to the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr remove `grpc-java` plugin related configuration from the `connect/connect-client-jvm module` for SBT because the code generation related to `grpc-java` is handled by the `connect-common` module. The reason this pr did not touch the Maven `pom.xml` is because the corresponding Maven modules originally did not have that configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up unnecessary sbt configurations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen you try to run a streaming query that contains a UDF from the REPL, for example:\r\n```scala\r\nval add1 = udf((i: Long) => i + 1)\r\nval query = spark.readStream\r\n    .format(\"rate\")\r\n    .option(\"rowsPerSecond\", \"10\")\r\n    .option(\"numPartitions\", \"1\")\r\n    .load()\r\n    .withColumn(\"value\", add1($\"value\"))\r\n    .writeStream\r\n    .format(\"memory\")\r\n    .queryName(\"my_sink\")\r\n    .start()\r\n```\r\nYou are currently greeted by a hard to understand deserialization issue, where a serialization proxy cannot be assigned to a field. The underlying cause here is a `ClassNotFoundException` (yes, java serialization is weird). This  `ClassNotFoundException`  is caused by us not propagating the `JobArtifactState` (this - indirectly - contains information about the location of REPL generated classes, and session local libraries) properly to the streaming query execution thread.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixed this by propagating the `JobArtifactState` into the stream execution thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is a bug. We want streaming to work with connect's isolated dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI added a test to `ReplE2ESuite`.","created_at":"2023-08-14T02:39:50Z","updated_at":"2023-08-15T17:02:40Z","closed_at":"2023-08-15T17:02:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3cf15eb3ae8b6987054fded47101fa5c34faa5ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nConnects arrow deserialization currently does not work with REPL generated classes. For example the following code would fail:\r\n```scala\r\ncase class MyTestClass(value: Int) {\r\n  override def toString: String = value.toString\r\n}\r\nspark.range(10).map(i => MyTestClass(i.toInt)).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that for instantiation of the `MyTestClass` class we need the instance of the class that it was defined in (its outerscope). In Spark we have a mechanism called `OuterScopes` to register these instances in. The `ArrowDeserializer` was not resolving this outer instance. This PR fixes this.\r\n\r\nWe have a similar issue on the executor/driver side. This will be fixed in a different PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is a bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI have added tests to `ReplE2Esuite` and to the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark runtime filter only supports using the subquery on one table.\r\nIn fact, we can reuse the exchange, even if it is a shuffle exchange.\r\nIf the shuffle exchange come from a join which has one side with selective predicates, so the results of the join can be used to prune the data amount of the application side.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEnhance the runtime filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nNew feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41013 that adds a check for `SPARK_CONNECT_MODE_ENABLED` when we create a Spark session via `pyspark.sql.SparkSession.getOrCreate()` so the next session can be consistently returned.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, it returns non Spark connect session if you call `SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate` after creating a Spark Connect session if `SPARK_REMOTE` is not globally set (that is currently automatically set if you launch `./bin/pyspark --remote local`). So this can only be reproducible when you Spark Connect as a library. See how it's tested below.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe change has not been released yet so there's no behaviour changes to the end users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested as below:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd python\r\npython\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\nSparkSession.builder.remote(\"local\").getOrCreate()\r\nSparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n<pyspark.sql.connect.session.SparkSession object at 0x7fa9807fd790>\r\n<pyspark.sql.session.SparkSession object at 0x7fd97890e730>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n<pyspark.sql.connect.session.SparkSession object at

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the logic of SchemaConverter.scala of the Avro connector when it deals with unions of a single type. \r\n\r\nIn the existing implementation, there seems to be an inconsistency in how the Spark-Avro connector converts Avro schemas to Spark's StructType. For complex union types, the conversion seems to work fine, wrapping the type into a StructType. However, for primitive union types (like [\"null\", \"string\"]), the connector simply returns the primitive type (in this case, StringType) without wrapping it into a StructType. This behavior may result in an exception if we are expecting a StructType but encounter a primitive type instead, and some users might want a more consistent conversion behavior.\r\n\r\nFor instance, for a type union[\"string\", null], it now converts it to a StructType(StringType) in Spark instead of a StringType.\r\nNote: this PR is **not to be merged** as it alters the default behavior. A more appropriate method is to add a config and adopt the changes only if that config flag is on.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis terminates Python worker created for `foreachBatch` when the streaming query terminate. \r\nAll of the tracking is done inside connect server (inside `StreamingForeachBatchHelper`). How this works:\r\n\r\n* (A) The helper class returns a cleaner (an `AutoCloseable`) to connect server when foreachBatch function is set up (happens before starting the query).\r\n* (B) If the query fails to start, server directly invokes the cleaner.\r\n* (C) If the query starts up, the server registers the cleaner with `streamingRunnerCleanerCache` in the `SessionHolder`.\r\n* (D) The cache keeps a mapping of query to cleaner.\r\n* It registers a streaming listener (only once per session), which invokes the cleaner when a query terminates. \r\n* There is also finally cleanup when SessionHolder expires. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis ensures Python process created for a streaming query is properly terminated when a query terminates. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Unit tests are added for `CleanerCache`\r\n- Existing unit tests for foreachBatch.\r\n- Manual test to verify python process is terminated in different cases. \r\n- Unit tests don't really verify that the process is terminated.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a displayOrder variable to WebUITab to specify the order in which tabs appear. Currently, the tabs are ordered by when they get attached, which isn't always desired. The default is MIN_VALUE, meaning if it's not specified, it will appear in the order added before any tabs with a non-default displayOrder. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese changes allow control over the order which tabs appear in the UI. Currently, the tabs are ordered by when they get attached, but this doesn't always match the desired order. For example, we would like to have the SQL Tab appear before the Connect tab; however, based on the code flow, the Connect tab will be attached first and with the current logic, that tab would also appear first.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, minor user-facing change affecting the order in which tabs appear in the Spark UI\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1696\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-10 at 3 54 26 PM\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSparkConnectExecutionManager is a val field in SparkConnectService, so it gets initialized the first time SparkConnectService object is touched. In some scenarios, this can accidentally happen too early, before anything is initialized. SparkConnectExecutionManager wants to read configs from SparkEnv, and when it's not initialized yet it can fail.\r\n\r\nMake SparkConnectExecutionManager lazy. Since it is `private[connect]` it should not then be initialized before the service is started.\r\n\r\nRaised https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44779 as a followup to look at the Spark Connect initialization in general.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix initialization order.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nGot one test failure in one specific environment that failed because of wrong initialization order.","created_at":"2023-08-11T18:50:21Z","updated_at":"2023-08-11T23:48:18Z","closed_at":"2023-08-11T23:48:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"85d7b8350c6ed99a57e33b6f9c28d70df7011e8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42457/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42457/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42457/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/84769e79baa5f7ca5bf4d6734b4a23f838e059cf","head":{"label":"juliuszsompolski:SPARK-44625-fup","ref":"SPARK-44625-fup","sha":"84769e79baa5f7ca5bf4d6734b4a23f838e059cf","user":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82301030,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjMwMTAzMA==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","description":"Mirror
