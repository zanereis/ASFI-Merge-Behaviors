reporting task used to hold a single AtlasClientV2 instance\r\nthroughout its runtime starting from being started until being stopped.\r\nIf it is configured to use Kerberos authentication for Atlas REST API, after\r\na published DelegationToken expires (10 hours by default), the reporting\r\ntask will not be able to recover from 401 Unauthorized state.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid stucking in such situation, this commit changes the\r\nway ReportLineageToAtlas uses AtlasClientV2 instance to create an\r\ninstance per onTrigger execution. It also addresses Kerberos ticket\r\nexpiration.\r\n\r\nThis approach incurs some overheads by initiating the client each time,\r\nhowever, it should be insignificant from an overall processing time\r\nperspective including analyzing NiFi flow and Provenance records.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install at the root nifi folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [

new processor performs basic text metrics on incoming flowfile content (line count, non-empty line count, word count, and character count). Each metric is independent, and word count can be configured to accept or split on symbol boundaries. \r\n\r\nThe performance is fairly decent (a document with ~370k lines / words ~= 80 - 90 ms on a commodity laptop) and handles the text in a streaming manner so as not to damage the heap. \r\n\r\nA sample flow.xml.gz is [posted here](https://gist.github.com/alopresto/86eb04437c079cf2a48e2aeadf2df7c0) to allow for local testing (relying on a locally downloaded file or an HTTP GET to a GitHub hosted file). \r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with NIFI-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install at the root nifi folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [

this fix, PublishKafka (0.9) and PublishKafka_0_10 fail with empty incoming FlowFiles due to 'transfer relationship not specified' error.\r\nBecause the internal 'publish' method is not called as StreamDemarcator does not emit any token regardless whether demarcator is set or not.\r\n\r\nAs for PublishKafka_0_11 and PublishKafka_1_0, empty FlowFiles are transferred to 'success' relationship, however no Kafka message is sent to Kafka.\r\n\r\nSince Kafka allows 0 byte body empty messages, NiFi should be able to send it, too.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes above current situation to the followings, with all PublishKafka_* processors:\r\n\r\n- If demarcator is not set, then publish incoming FlowFile content as it is. This enables sending an empty Kafka message.\r\n- If demarcator is set, send each token as a separate message.\r\n  Even if no token is found (empty incoming FlowFile), transfer the FlowFile to 'success'.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with NIFI-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install at the root nifi folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the NOTICE file, including the main NOTICE file found under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added .displayName in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is
