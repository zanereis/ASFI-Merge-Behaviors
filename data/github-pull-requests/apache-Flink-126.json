What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nDeadlock breakup algorithm and Multi-input operator creation algorithm need information about the input edges of an exec node, for example what's the priority of this input, and how the input records will trigger the output records.\r\n\r\nAlthough `BatchExecNode` currently has a `getDamBehavior` method, it only describes the behavior of the node and is not very useful for the new deadlock breakup algorithm. So we're going to introduce a new class `ExecEdge` to describe this and a new method `getInputEdges` for `ExecNode`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Introduce `ExecEdge`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is covered by existing tests, such as `DeadlockBreakupTest`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths

Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix `TableEnvHiveConnectorITCase` for Hive-3.x.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Set ACID transaction manager for 3.x -- it's required for the transaction table tests.\r\n  - Configures the standalone HMS to prepare ACID tables for the test.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nManually verified tests for all hive versions.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nNA\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-14T03:07:42Z","updated_at":"2020-10-20T06:44:26Z","closed_at":"2020-10-20T06:40:14Z","merged_at":"2020-10-20T06:40:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"eb6d6f3981c9913a4520dca3f870223fcef03350","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13624/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13624/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13624/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8e22bf8beafb8d11704d84c7a30b46eb79025014","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-19368","ref":"FLINK-19368","sha":"8e22bf8beafb8d11704d84c7a30b46eb79025014","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces `WindowJoinOperator` and `WindowJoinOperatorSimple`,\r\n\r\nThe `WindowJoinOperator` accepts two streams and windows each stream, when\r\nwatermark passes and triggers each window, it joins the dataset of the\r\ntwo stream windows and emit the results. Note that the operator itself\r\ngenerates the window attributes.\r\n\r\nThe `WindowJoinOperatorSimple` is a simpler version of `WindowJoinOperator`,\r\nit assumes that all the inputs has window attributes(e.g. window_start\r\nand window_end), so there is no need for windowing again.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add two operators, `WindowJoinOperator` and

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces two types of sink writer operators:\r\n1. The `StatelessWriterOperator` is for the case where the writer state serializer is not provided.\r\n2. The `StatefulWriterOperator` is for the case where the writer state serializer is provided.\r\n\r\nThe `AbstractWriterOperator` is the base class of the two operators.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Introduce the base writer operator class `AbstractWriterOperator`\r\n2. Introduce the `StatelessWriterOperator`\r\n3. introduce the `StatefulWriterOperator`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n1. `WriterOperatorTest::testStatelessWriter` tests the whole process of 'open/process/presnapshot/snapshot/close/restore' of the  `StatelessWriterOperator`.\r\n1. `WriterOperatorTest::testStatefulWriter` tests the whole process of `open/process/presnapshot/snapshot/close/restore` of the `StatefulWriterOperator`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nPartial records happen if a record can not fit into one buffer, then the remaining part of the same record is put into the next buffer. Hence partial records only exist at the beginning of a buffer. Partial record clean-up is needed in the mode of approximate local recovery. If a record is spanning over multiple buffers, and the first (several) buffers have got lost due to the failure of the receiver task, the remaining data belonging to the same record in transition should be cleaned up.\r\n\r\n`partialRecordLength` is the length of bytes to skip in order to start with a complete record, from position index 0 of the underlying MemorySegment. `partialRecordLength` is used in approximate local recovery to find the start position of a complete record on a BufferConsumer, so-called `partial record clean-up`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- API change to add `partialRecordLength` when creating a BufferConsumer\r\n- Add `partialRecordLength` in `BufferWritingResultPartition` when emitRecord and `broadcastRecord`\r\n- Update the type of buffers in PipelinedSubpartition fr`PrioritizedDeque<BufferConsumer>` to `PrioritizedDeque<BufferConsumerWithPartialRecordLength>`\r\n- Implement partial record clean-up logic in BufferConsumerWithPartialRecordLength\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- add unit tests to test partial record length\r\n- pass existing tests to make sure the changes do not affect data write/read/transition.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFrom @StephanEwen \r\nWe should not have a test-jar for the flink-connector-files project, because the module it is not scala-versioned. Thus we cannot release an artifact with a dependency on a specific scala version (like the test jar).\r\n\r\nWe need to have the connector test utils in a different project, or add a scala version to the module (I would like to avoid a scala version if possible).\r\n\r\nWe should use `AdapterTestBase` to test formats, it is a scala free class, we can create a module `flink-connector-files-test-utils`, and move the abstract class to it. And formats should depend on it.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nRevert 8084bdd9a16d8524c33a5a7b588232d8995bca23\r\nRemove `FileSourceParquetColumnarITCase`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-13T08:15:55Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T18:24:31Z","closed_at":"2020-10-14T06:36:54Z","merged_at":"2020-10-14T06:36:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"43aa3fdedc0409006887c36971eccb351e2a438a","assignee":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273025819,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1ODE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Configuration","name":"component=Runtime/Configuration","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13609/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13609/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13609/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c8c5eee65fdcb15353189eb29cad3ec5bd767c29","head":{"label":"qinghui-xu:FLINK-19523","ref":"FLINK-19523","sha":"c8c5eee65fdcb15353189eb29cad3ec5bd767c29","user":{"login":"qinghui-xu","id":5479630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0Nzk2MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5479630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinghui-xu","html_url":"https://github.com/qinghui-xu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinghui-xu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinghui-xu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinghui-xu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinghui-xu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinghui-xu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinghui-xu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinghui-xu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinghui-xu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinghui-xu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":294892160,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTQ4OTIxNjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"qinghui-xu/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"qinghui-xu","id":5479630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0Nzk2MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5479630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinghui-xu","html_url":"https://github.com/qinghui-xu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinghui-xu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinghui-xu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinghui-xu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinghui-xu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinghui-xu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinghui-xu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinghui-xu/repos","

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n The image size for native k8s pyflink application is a bit large, it might take some time to start up the pod. Currently, the timeout for waiting the job manager's availability are only 30s,  increasing it to 60s to avoid judging the test to be fail too soon.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Increasing the timeout for waiting the job manager's availability from 30s to 60s in test_kubernetes_pyflink_application.sh.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis pull request will be verified by the e2e test in test_kubernetes_pyflink_application.sh.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? ( not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-13T07:12:20Z","updated_at":"2020-10-13T12:14:21Z","closed_at":"2020-10-13T12:14:21Z","merged_at":"2020-10-13T12:14:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"e8ad5787355fc7bc55a81d901f9c627d83b3981b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273030665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDMwNjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Python","name":"component=API/Python","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13607/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13607/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13607/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0523bbc1cd02addf3327dd8f0c4d817f9d7a247e","head":{"label":"shuiqiangchen:FLINK-19484","ref":"FLINK-19484","sha":"0523bbc1cd02addf3327dd8f0c4d817f9d7a247e","user":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":157520857,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTc1MjA4NTc=","name":"flink","full_name":"shuiqiangchen/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen/flink","description":"Apache

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFixes UnalignedCheckpointCompatibilityITCase.test:97->runAndTakeSavepoint: \"Not all required tasks are currently running.\", which may be caused when deploying takes longer than expected, such that stopWithSavepoint is called before everything is running.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Allow savepoints to be used in MiniCluster.\r\n- Use JobDetailsInfo to ensure that job and all tasks are running.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFixes test failure.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-13T05:38:50Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T14:26:14Z","closed_at":"2020-10-16T14:26:08Z","merged_at":"2020-10-16T14:26:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"02177a2b33a75e70925e29c8f268135adb85347c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13604/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13604/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13604/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/2c46ee38b46372ba7e5fbe33d186b29b39a2a0e1","head":{"label":"AHeise:FLINK-19585","ref":"FLINK-19585","sha":"2c46ee38b46372ba7e5fbe33d186b29b39a2a0e1","user":{"login":"AHeise","id":4559103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTkxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4559103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise","html_url":"https://github.com/AHeise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d0a371603d3ebb6c1d1eedbab60af6ef7ae9071a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nReport the ClusterPartitionDescriptor when the job is finished via JobResult so that the following job can use the ClusterPartitionDescriptor to read from the cluster partition directly. This is required to support table caching. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduce the ClusterPartitionDescriptor that includes information about the cluster partition. \r\n- Put ClusterPartitionDescriptor of ClusterPartition in JobResult when job finishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added test that validates that ClusterPartitionDescriptor is generated correctly*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-13T01:59:21Z","updated_at":"2022-08-17T15:57:41Z","closed_at":"2022-08-17T15:57:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c792298917ea1e381af52704b302e632c561e95c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"becketqin","id":5778611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg2MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5778611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin","html_url":"https://github.com/becketqin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13602/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13602/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13602/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0f7dba46cebbc05ff000380d5bef450f83d991d6","head":{"label":"Sxnan:FLINK-19346","ref":"FLINK-19346","sha":"0f7dba46cebbc05ff000380d5bef450f83d991d6","user":{"login":"Sxnan","id":12155662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU1NjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12155662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan","html_url":"https://github.com/Sxnan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187957720,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc5NTc3MjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"Sxnan/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Sxnan","id":12155662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU1NjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12155662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan","html_url":"https://github.com/Sxnan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Sxnan/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTranslate \"Monitoring REST API\" page of \"Debugging & Monitoring\" into Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-13T01:13:52Z","updated_at":"2020-11-06T11:28:05Z","closed_at":"2020-11-06T11:28:05Z","merged_at":"2020-11-06T11:28:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"798dfbfa7db71f3531ff8e0663a1d204b2b898ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278841078,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4ODQxMDc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=chinese-translation","name":"component=chinese-translation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13601/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13601/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13601/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1ec50f73d147477a8c6e8eef990d6fae7eb9ddfa","head":{"label":"weizheng92:master","ref":"master","sha":"1ec50f73d147477a8c6e8eef990d6fae7eb9ddfa","user":{"login":"weizheng92","id":11443175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQzMTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11443175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92","html_url":"https://github.com/weizheng92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"237dbf5d089c01a52dfeadcb531b1885302c754b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue that the ORC writer uses a fixed fake path, but the path is used as the key to the memory manager. This PR changes the fixed key to a random path generated by UUID.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- f8999981b7ea5f6d09a5b6a1c7668952299ae15c changes the fixed path to the random path. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded UT to verify the writers are added to `MemoryManager` with different path as key.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nI introduce a BatchExecutionInternalTimeServiceManager and\r\nBatchExecutionInternalTimeService which can be used in the batch\r\nexecution mode along with the BatchExecutionStateBackend. These services\r\nonly ever keep state for a single key at a time. They assume a perfect\r\nWatermark and fire timers only upon switching the current key. Therefore\r\nthey require the input to be sorted/grouped by the key.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n* tests in `BatchExecutionInternalTimeServiceTest`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nHash-based blocking shuffle and sort-merge based blocking shuffle are two main blocking shuffle implementations wildly adopted by existing distributed data processing frameworks. Hash-based implementation writes data sent to different reducer tasks into separate files concurrently while sort-merge based approach writes those data together into a single file and merges those small files into bigger ones. Compared to sort-merge based approach, hash-based approach has several weak points when it comes to running large scale batch jobs. By introducing the sort-merge based approach to Flink, we can improve Flink’s capability of running large scale batch jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Introduce SortBuffer and its implementation PartitionSortedBuffer for sort-merge based blocking shuffle\r\n  - Introduce PartitionedFile and the corresponding writer/reader for sort-merge based blocking shuffle\r\n  - Introduce sort-merge based result partition SortMergeResultPartition and the corresponding subpartition reader\r\n  - Introduce new config options to enable sort-merge based blocking shuffle\r\n  - Introduce shuffle data compression to sort-merge based blocking shuffle\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nSeveral new tests are added to verify this change, including PartitionSortedBufferTest, PartitionedFileWriteReadTest, SortMergeResultPartitionTest and BlockingShuffleITCase.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when executing DELETE statement in JDBC upsert sink\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fix `JdbcDynamicOutputFormatBuilder#createDeleteExecutor`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added a test which can reproduce this problem.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-12T13:15:49Z","updated_at":"2020-10-13T10:45:01Z","closed_at":"2020-10-13T10:44:56Z","merged_at":"2020-10-13T10:44:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"42320ef205cb6afd98ffc9c2756a4abc7dc042e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278775149,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc1MTQ5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/JDBC","name":"component=Connectors/JDBC","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1292353221,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkyMzUzMjIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Ecosystem","name":"component=TableSQL/Ecosystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13594/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13594/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13594/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9bcebe7b1ec733192f6b96067ede9ecd7c18115a","head":{"label":"wuchong:fix-jdbc-1.11","ref":"fix-jdbc-1.11","sha":"9bcebe7b1ec733192f6b96067ede9ecd7c18115a","user":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63797485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Mzc5NzQ4NQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"wuchong/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong/flink","description":"Mirror

This now adjusts the logic to correctly reflect the requirements for idleness notifications, as required by the reader, where at least one of the following conditions must be true:\r\n\r\n  - Either the fetcher was already set to idle when the reader thread pulled the last fetch from the queue, because that is when the reader thread checks for fetcher being idle and shuts it down (which signals end of input)\r\n  - Or the fetcher was not yet marked idle, because the fetch was pulled before that flag was set. In that case, the availability future must be completed, so that the reader thread goes back to checking the

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBecause watching is the default for serve since 2.4.0, we use `--force_polling` for regenerating the docs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n \r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n \r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-12T08:23:35Z","updated_at":"2021-01-11T03:16:50Z","closed_at":"2020-12-09T16:36:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bfe311e1113d76eed361fb2e5a62db423bd25cab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13589/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13589/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13589/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/7c3d1edbaa6c2fd237f5f11245414b709e598709","head":{"label":"KyleZhang0536:FLINK-19513","ref":"FLINK-19513","sha":"7c3d1edbaa6c2fd237f5f11245414b709e598709","user":{"login":"KyleZhang0536","id":6970622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzA2MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6970622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleZhang0536","html_url":"https://github.com/KyleZhang0536","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleZhang0536/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleZhang0536/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleZhang0536/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleZhang0536/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleZhang0536/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleZhang0536/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleZhang0536/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleZhang0536/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleZhang0536/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"cf4328db168fe5488514efdedb9773ca32ded9f4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-11T15:20:06Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T03:39:17Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13586/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13586/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13586/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e3cef29a579eff88416b9e34bfe51f022d38a0d0","head":{"label":"curcur:single_task_result_partial_record_header","ref":"single_task_result_partial_record_header","sha":"e3cef29a579eff88416b9e34bfe51f022d38a0d0","user":{"login":"curcur","id":11065508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY1NTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11065508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur","html_url":"https://github.com/curcur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":193172750,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMxNzI3NTA=","name":"flink","full_name":"curcur/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"curcur","id":11065508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY1NTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11065508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur","html_url":"https://github.com/curcur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/curcur/flink","description":"Apache

log\r\n\r\n1. For the banned dependencies 'org.apache.kafka:kafka_2.10:jar:0.10.2.0', just excluding from 'flink-sql-connector-hive-2.3.6' module.\r\n2. For the banned dependencies 'org.yaml:snakeyaml:jar:1.24'. This occur when other modules depend on  'flink-kubernetes' module. For 'maven-enforcer-plugin' is unable to recognize the discrepancy since the transitive dependency's version was altered by 'dependencyManagement'. \r\n    So just excluding 'org.yaml:snakeyaml:jar:1.24' from 'io.fabric8:kubernetes-client' and depend on the version of 1.27.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently in Application Mode when we shutdown the cluster we always clean up the HA data of a job. This also includes the cases when the job fails due to a transient error. This behaviour leads to the job not being able to restart even if HA is activated. This PR fixes the issue by only cleaning up the HA data when the job has explicitly reported reaching a terminal state (FAILED, SUCCEEDED, or CANCELLED), and not as a reaction to framework failures or other issues.\r\n\r\nNOTE TO REVIEWERS: Maybe in some cases, we would like to not even shut down the cluster. But I do not think we can find all these cases and filter by specific exceptions so at least now we can go through the restart process without problems.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThe main change is in the `ApplicationDispatcherBootstrap.runApplicationAndShutdownClusterAsync()`. This is where the shutting down of the cluster is happening.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as the tests in the `ApplicationDispatcherBootstrapTest` that were modified.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

we are not ware that it also needs to change the respective length for related netty messages component.\r\nThis PR explicitly get the ByteBuf length of all classes which is written to NettyMessage to avoid such problems.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe word 'post' is misspelled, it should be 'port'.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11443175/95643722-80d18200-0ae3-11eb-8b61-c3c423eaf350.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-10T02:26:17Z","updated_at":"2020-10-11T03:18:40Z","closed_at":"2020-10-11T03:18:39Z","merged_at":"2020-10-11T03:18:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"2126397101877d31978a15cdb311550f1475d7a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13578/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13578/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13578/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/58497d79e94d29e9f8a1a43f0964ab7446f30d5c","head":{"label":"weizheng92:master","ref":"master","sha":"58497d79e94d29e9f8a1a43f0964ab7446f30d5c","user":{"login":"weizheng92","id":11443175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQzMTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11443175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92","html_url":"https://github.com/weizheng92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizheng92/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"0b6c086af921ec1abc0757680ddb3285a8828bca","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new sink API as the FLIP-143.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n1.  Add `Sink` interface\r\n2. Add `Writer` interface for producing committable data\r\n3.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis patch adds an implementation of Kafka source based on FLIP-27.\r\n\r\nA few clarifications:\r\n1. Package paths. The patch reuses the current module of `flink-connectors/flink-connector-kafka`, but with a new package path `org.apache.flink.connector.kafka.source`.\r\n2. The serialization schema. This patch currently creates a new `KafkaRecordDeserializer` class instead of reusing the `org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.KafkaDeserializationSchema`. This is to make future deprecation of old KafkaDeserializationSchema easier. We will migrate the existing implementation of `KafkaDeserializationSchema` in a separate patch. Also, ideally we should unify the `KafkaRecordDeserializer` with the interface of `DeserializationSchema`. At this point `DeserializationSchema` assumes each serialized record is represented by a single byte array, so it is not suitable for the Kafka case where a serialized record is a `ConsumerRecord<byte[], byte[]>`.\r\n3. The patch did not add some necessary API in the SplitEnumerator and SplitReader, namely the following: 1) a `close()` method in `SplitReader`; 2) the `onCheckpointComplete()` callback in the `SplitEnumerator` and `SourceReader`. These API changes will be done in a separate patch.\r\n4. This patch still needs more integration tests. I'll add more tests either while the PR is in review or in followup patches.\r\n5. The docs will be added later in a separate commit in this PR once the code is reviewed.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n77c6b0a0a7039ab Move the test code of flink-connector-base to a separate module of flink-connector-base-test.\r\n440dcbefdf9a56eb Make RecreateOnResetOperatorCoordinator fully asynchronous.\r\n80ff3b43afa00f011 [FLINK-18323][connector/kafka] Add Kafka Source based on FLIP-27.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThe changes in this patch are mostly in `flink-connectors/flink-connector-kafka/` module. Unit tests and basic IT cases are added under `org.apache.flink.connector.kafka.source` package in the test directory.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (No)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove unfenced execution of Disconnected message from `MesosResourceManager`. The reason why this should be possible is that we re-create the `ConnectionMonitor`, `TaskMonitor`, `LaunchCoordinator` and `ReconciliationCoordinator` when regaining the leadership. Hence, it should not be necessary to process the `Disconnected` message when having lost the leadership.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change will be verified by running the Jepsen tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Currently Python DataStream doesn't support Python datetime object in `from_collection` of `StreamExecutionEnvironment`. It should support datetime object by coverting datetime elements in collection based on `to_sql_type` of `DataType`.*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *`from_collection` of `StreamExecutionEnvironment` adds converter of elements in collection with `to_sql_type` of `DataType` to support datetime object.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - *`test_from_collection_with_data_types` and `test_from_collection_without_data_types` in `StreamExecutionEnvironmentTests` adds test cases for datetime object to verify whether `from_collection` of `StreamExecutionEnvironment` supports datetime object in DataStream.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently the error thrown from `runAsync()` method will be swallowed because Flink didn't handle all throwables with `AkkaRpcActor`. Here is a temporary fix for such cases in `YarnResourceManager`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Use try-catch to wrap the runnable that was invoked in `runAsync()` method, and reuse the `FatalErrorHandler` to handle the error.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* Add a new unit test\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe fix is necessary since there is a possibility that a `ConcurrentModificationException` is thrown as described in FLINK-17341.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThe solution includes switching from `Iterator` to a `Set` of `AllocationID`s:\r\n- Introduced `TaskSlotTable.getActiveTaskAllocationIdsPerJob(JobID)`\r\n- Replaced usage of `TaskSlotTable.getActiveSlots(JobID)` by `TaskSlotTable.getActiveTaskAllocationIdsPerJob(JobID)`\r\n- Removed `TaskSlotTable.getActiveSlots(JobID)` and `TaskSlotTable.AllocationIDIterator`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as `TaskSlotTableImplTest.testTryMarkSlotActive`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers:

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes a range of smaller bugs introduced in #13228. They all affect the (priority) availability of InputGate and trigger various kinds of preconditions that have been in embedded into the network stack.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fix union gate polling gates through iterator. That may leave `PriorityDeque` in inconsistent state.\r\n- Double-check if gate still has priority buffer when enqueuing in `UnionInputGate`. Since notification is not atomic in respect to gate enqueuing, priority event already polled by task thread when netty enqueues the gate.\r\n- Only notify data available when there is a non-priority buffer. This avoids `StreamTaskNetworkInput` to poll empty gates.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added tests for each bug (WIP).\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

the `AllocatedSlotPool`, a component of the new declarative slot pool, providing basic book-keeping for allocated slots.\r\n\r\nWith this PR I'm also proposing a change in terminology in regards to `allocate`. Currently, \"allocating a slot\" has different meanings as it both describes a slot being assigned to a job by the ResourceManager, and an (allocated) slot being allocated for a task by the JobMaster.\r\nI'd like to get rid of this duality, and propose for the job master to \"reserve\" allocated slots when using them for a task.","created_at":"2020-10-08T11:03:03Z","updated_at":"2020-10-14T07:56:56Z","closed_at":"2020-10-13T14:41:30Z","merged_at":"2020-10-13T14:41:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"099e98204fafe25b70eabe6b45e4e12868169a3e","assignee":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13561/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13561/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13561/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/ce728545af6c30e615d4c972b902d065b454ae18","head":{"label":"zentol:19315","ref":"19315","sha":"ce728545af6c30e615d4c972b902d065b454ae18","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20647396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0NzM5Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"zentol/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.co

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWe use the 'SinkTransformation' to represent the new sink API after the FLIP-143. So this commit renames the 'SinkTransformation' to 'LegacySinkTransformation'.\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAlthough `DataStream` is going to be the unified API for Batch and Streaming applications (see [FLIP-134](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-134%3A+Batch+execution+for+the+DataStream+API) ) , some operations, _e.g._ Sinks, may need to have different runtime implementations depending on if they are intended to run on bounded or unbounded data. This is not necessarily only for optimisations but also for the exposed semantics, _i.e._ correctness.\r\n\r\nSo far, DataStream had a 1-to-1 mapping between an API call and an operator. In a sense, the DataStream API was an \"explicit\" API. With this addition, we will decouple the API calls from the actual runtime implementations of the operations and thus allow different operations to have more than one runtime implementations, depending (for now) on the `execution.runtime-mode`.\r\n\r\nIn this PR we introduce the `StreamGraphTranslator` interface, which is the main new entity responsible for translating a `Transformation` into its runtime implementation, the framework based on which a developer can write a `StreamGraphTranslator` for a new `Transformation` and wire it to the `StreamGraphGenerator` and an example implementation for the `OneInputTransformation`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThe changes are mainly in the `StreamGraphGenerator` and the addition of the `StreamGraphTranslator`/`BaseSimpleTransformationTranslator`/`OneInputTranslator`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nWith the addition of the new `OneInputTranslator`, all existing tests (including e2e tests) using an `OneInputTransformation` also verify the changes in this PR.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: I would also like to move the `streaming.api.graph` to a new `streaming.runtime.graph` package as this seems more \"correct\" but this will fail because if we move the `StreamGraph`, then we will break binary compatibility because of the `LocalStreamEnvironment.execute(streamGraph)` and

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFollow the discussion in this PR [1].\r\n\r\nIf we could run the K8s related e2e tests in multiple versions(the latest version, oldest maintained version, etc.), it will help us to find the usability issues earlier before users post them in the user ML[2].\r\n\r\n[1].https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/12071#discussion_r422838483\r\n[2].https://lists.apache.org/list.html?user@flink.apache.org:lte=1M:Cannot%20start%20native%20K8s\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- For Linux os, test against the most recent three minor releases of k8s, i.e., v1.19.2, v1.18.9 and v1.17.12 (versions are expected to be updated with new k8s releases)\r\n- Covered all 5 end-to-end test cases related to k8s\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBefore, it was up to the `CustomCommandLine` implementation whether any `Configuration` was passed through from the flink-conf.yaml or wherever the base `Configuration` came from.\r\n\r\nNow, we make the flow of the `Configuration` explicit in `CliFrontend.getEffectiveConfiguration()`. Instead of relying on the `Configuration` we get from the `CustomCommandLine` we ask the `CustomCommandLine` to materialize its settings and add them manually to an effective `Configuration` that the `CliFrontend` controls.\r\n\r\nThis removes the `Configuration` parameter from `CustomCommandLines` that don't need it anymore, such as `DefaultCLI`, which means we also have to touch tests. Also, the test for `DefaultCLI` is vastly simplified because the behaviour we were testing there is now in the new ITCase.\r\n\r\nThis adds a new integration test in `CliFrontendITCase` that verifies correct parameter passing and also verifies that command line arguments override base settings\r\n\r\nI'm also addressing https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-19521 here because I noticed and filed that during implementation. It's a small change but should make the CLI more consistent. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- A new ITCase was added.\r\n- Added test for dynamic properties on `DefaultCLI`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes, dynamic properties for the DefaultCLI\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

on #13544.\r\n\r\nAdds the `DeclarativeSlotManager` (DSM), an alternative `SlotManager` implementation that supports FLIP-138.\r\n\r\nThe core difference to the existing implementation is that the DSM does not receive individual slot requests from the JobMaster, but a `ResourceRequirements` instead that outlines the absolute requirements for the job.\r\nThe DSM keeps track of these, along with all registered and pending slots, matches requirements to slots and initiates the allocation of the slot.\r\n\r\nMost of this logic and book-keeping is handled by recently added components (`SlotTracker`, `ResourceTracker`, `TaskExecutorManager`).\r\n\r\nWhat is left in the DSM itself is\r\na) a bunch of glue between these components and the `SlotManager` API\r\nb) the logic for matching missing to available/pending resources and initiating the corresponding slot allocations.\r\n\r\nThe entry point for b) is `checkResourceRequirements()`, which is called on any significant change to the state of requirements or resources; it is called when requirements change, slots are added/removed, allocations are complete/failed.\r\nThis method essentially does the following:\r\n- retrieve the currently missing resources from the `ResourceTracker`\r\n- try assigning these resources to free slots, provided by the `SlotTracker`\r\n  - if a match was found, start the allocation of the slot\r\n- if at the end of this process there are still missing resource, match the remaining missing resources against the pending slots, provided by the `TaskExecutorManager`\r\n  - if a match was found for a requirement, do nothing. We do not maintain a mapping of requirements to pending resources as it would double the book-keeping. We just consider this requirement as fulfilled within the scope of this check.\r\n  - if no match was found for a requirement, try allocating a new worker (implicitly increasing the pool of pending slots)\r\n- if at the end of this process missing resource are still present (== no more workers can be allocated) inform the JobMaster about there not being enough resources to fulfill the requirement\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-07T13:06:15Z","updated_at":"2020-10-20T09:32:57Z","closed_at":"2020-10-16T09:44:30Z","merged_at":"2020-10-16T09:44:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"50671d36beeade9c73299b7191408b217f20755c","assignee":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13553/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13553/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13553/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a8eb317e44eb07959275437a44caa94f2d48d8ba","head":{"label":"zentol:19306","ref":"19306","sha":"a8eb317e44eb07959275437a44caa94f2d48d8ba","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20647396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0NzM5Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"zentol/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https:/

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWith the larger refactoring of checkpoint alignment and the additional of more unaligned checkpoint settings, it becomes increasingly important to provide a large test coverage.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, adding sufficient test cases in a test matrix appears to be unrealistic: many of the encountered issues were subtle, sometimes caused by race conditions or unusual test configurations and often only visible in e2e tests.\r\n\r\nHence, we like to rely on all existing Flink tests to provide a sufficient coverage for checkpointing. However, as more and more options in unaligned checkpoint are going to be implemented in this and the upcoming release, running all Flink tests - especially e2e - in a test matrix is prohibitively expensive, even for nightly builds.\r\n\r\nThus, we want to introduce test randomization for all tests that do not use a specific checkpointing mode. In a similar way, we switched from aligned checkpoints by default in tests to unaligned checkpoint during the last release cycle.\r\n\r\nTo not burden the developers of other components too much, we set the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- Randomization should be seeded in a way that both builds on Azure pipelines and local builds will result in the same settings to ease debugging and ensure reproducibility.\r\n- Randomized options should be shown in the test log.\r\n- Execution order of test cases will not influence the randomization.\r\n- Randomization is hidden, no change on any test is needed.\r\n- Randomization only happens during local/remote test execution. User deployments are not affected.\r\n- Test developers are able to avoid randomization by explicitly providing checkpoint configs.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add generic method to choose random values for checkpoint config.\r\n- Use it for uninitialized \"execution.checkpointing.unaligned\".\r\n- Adds flag to enable randomization in root pom. User code will not trigger randomization but chooses constant default values.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Not covered (yet)\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-07T10:42:24Z","updated_at":"2021-02-10T13:31:35Z","closed_at":"2021-02-10T13:31:27Z","merged_at":"2021-02-10T13:31:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"4fd2cec5b9390e6f7e26b0a86b5f4886ff7e68e5","assignee":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"pnowojski","id":8957547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTc1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8957547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski","html_url":"https://github.com/pnowojski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273025819,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1ODE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Configuration","name":"component=Runtime/Configuration","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13551/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13551/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13551/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/3d69b21f05abca0de64a2e778c292a7d0694b263","head":{"label":"AHeise:FLINK-19520","ref":"FLINK-19520","sha":"3d69b21f05abca0de64a2e778c292a7d0694b263","user":{"login":"AHeise","id":4559103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTkxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4559103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise","html_url":"https://github.com/AHeise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin"

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces a SingleKeyStateBackend. This state backend is a\r\nsimplified version of a state backend that can be used in a BATCH\r\nruntime mode. It requires the input to be sorted, as it only ever\r\nremembers the current key. If the key changes, the current state is\r\ndiscarded. Moreover this state backend does not support checkpointing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests:\r\n* org.apache.flink.streaming.api.operators.sorted.state.SingleKeyStateBackendVerificationTest\r\n* org.apache.flink.streaming.api.operators.sorted.state.SingleKeyStateBackendTest\r\n* org.apache.flink.streaming.api.operators.sorted.state.SingleKeyKeyGroupedInternalPriorityQueueTest\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nA small code optimization attempting to reduce the virtual method call overhead on the per-record methods in `ResultPartition`.\r\n\r\nIt does that by making the class wrapping the `ResultPartition` (formerly `ConsumableNotifyingResultPartitionWriterDecorator`) a different class than the one with the factory method. That way, if the factory method never needs a wrapper class (under normal configuration, it never needs one) the wrapping class is never loaded, and the JIT can find out (through CHA) that only one implementation for the per-record methods on `ResultPartition` exists.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **no**\r\n  - The serializers: **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **yes**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the

the `TaskExecutorManager` (TEM), a component of the new declarative slot manager handling all task executor related things, including bookkeeping of active task executors, allocation of new workers, idleness checks, _and more_.\r\n\r\nWhile this sounds sophisticated, it really isn't. The TEM was created by literally ripping out all the task executor stuff from the slot manager and dumping it into this class. Some log messages and method names were adjusted though.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this class is to keep all this stuff out of the slot manager; there are a fair number of things in there that the slot manager shouldn't deal with, but the current distribution of responsibilities (that we have to maintain to be compatible with the RM) does not allow us to change it. This component is a compromise of sorts. It _must_ be refactored in the future.\r\n\r\nOn the testing side things don't look any better; there were some tests for the slot manager that were only covering behaviors of the (now existing) TEM, and were moved to work directly against the TEM, which is essentially it.\r\n\r\nAny person brave enough to glare at this PR is advised to take a peek at [this branch](https://github.com/tillrohrmann/flink/blob/declarative-resource-management/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/resourcemanager/slotmanager/DeclarativeSlotManager.java) to see how the new slot manager interacts with the TEM.","created_at":"2020-10-06T09:52:53Z","updated_at":"2020-10-14T07:56:34Z","closed_at":"2020-10-13T11:48:51Z","merged_at":"2020-10-13T11:48:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"4eba4c3f7a26e2ef6963b5f51f209ec96305757f","assignee":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13544/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13544/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13544/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/63c62b4aa413c927b2b16e3bccbb90eec03cbb16","head":{"label":"zentol:19309","ref":"19309","sha":"63c62b4aa413c927b2b16e3bccbb90eec03cbb16","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20647396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0NzM5Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"zentol/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-06T02:11:12Z","updated_at":"2020-10-06T07:49:12Z","closed_at":"2020-10-06T07:49:12Z","merged_at":"2020-10-06T07:49:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"3dceaca7377dc444c8a2f304140069d1a7da48ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273465073,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDY1MDcz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/REST","name":"component=Runtime/REST","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13542/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13542/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13542/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a4019c50ca9bdea3baa0f3e0b10efd9d21b51877","head":{"label":"gm7y8:FLINK-19501","ref":"FLINK-19501","sha":"a4019c50ca9bdea3baa0f3e0b10efd9d21b51877","user":{"login":"gm7y8","id":12487613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDg3NjEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12487613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8","html_url":"https://github.com/gm7y8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":287861364,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODc4NjEzNjQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"gm7y8/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gm7y8","id":12487613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDg3NjEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12487613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8","html_url":"https://github.com/gm7y8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gm7y8/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gm7y8/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is removing a test-instability, where sometimes, the DispatcherResourceCleanupTest. testJobSubmissionUnderSameJobId() would report a `DuplicateJobSubmissionException`. \r\nThe test is initialized with a dispatcher, recovering the testing job graph. Once the TestingJobManagerRunner for this job graph has been created, the result future is completed, and a new job gets submitted.\r\nThe problem is that the `DispatcherJob.isDuplicateJob()` method might still find the job in the `runningJobs` list, because the cleanup from that list happens asynchronously.\r\n\r\nThe test instability is resolved by waiting until TestingJobManagerRunner has been closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nI have executed this patch 4000 times on CI, without a failure: https://dev.azure.com/rmetzger/Flink/_build/results?buildId=8421&view=results\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\nThe change only affects tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-05T08:14:05Z","updated_at":"2020-10-07T06:17:38Z","closed_at":"2020-10-07T06:17:37Z","merged_at":"2020-10-07T06:17:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"238d94d3798a55feee0e5d86168a088b568c8b2e","assignee":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13540/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13540/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13540/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8842d1927613cdcd09f4e6c671c9cb1dc671269e","head":{"label":"rmetzger:FLINK-19344-dispatcher-cleanup","ref":"FLINK-19344-dispatcher-cleanup","sha":"8842d1927613cdcd09f4e6c671c9cb1dc671269e","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20618957,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDYxODk1Nw==","name":"flink","full_name":"rmetzger/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.git

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIf a local channel does not receive a buffer during recovery, a live lock may occur where the local channel cannot recover because it is waiting for a buffer but upstream operators are fully backpressured and cannot release a buffer.\r\nIt's important to treat LocalRecoveredInputChannel like RemoteInputChannels and assign exclusive buffers for recovery to avoid this situation.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Assign exclusive buffers to LocalRecoveredInputChannel.\r\n- Ensure SingleInputGateTest does not swallow exceptions during cleanup.\r\n- Revert https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/13532 as the test failure actually revealed the live lock.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdjusted a few unit tests.\r\nAlready covered and reveleaed by UnalignedCheckpointITCase.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-04T08:57:06Z","updated_at":"2020-10-06T11:24:53Z","closed_at":"2020-10-06T11:24:49Z","merged_at":"2020-10-06T11:24:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"61a997364b020b44bd26df76208e76106c6390b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13539/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13539/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13539/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/52830dff69c113aeb1a53a1cbe3fd859c7863a60","head":{"label":"AHeise:FLINK-19027-2","ref":"FLINK-19027-2","sha":"52830dff69c113aeb1a53a1cbe3fd859c7863a60","user":{"login":"AHeise","id":4559103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTkxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4559103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise","html_url":"https://github.com/AHeise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"6c7b195d57c3bad5bc1f2251de75ac744dbbe4a7","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFor yet unknown reason, a quick checkpoint during recovery of unaligned checkpoint causes the checkpoint to not progress. Since the checkpoint timeout is longer than the test timeout, the test timeout hit first.\r\n\r\nThis commit decreases checkpoint timeout to avoid livelocking in UnalignedCheckpointITCase.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Decreases checkpoint timeout to avoid livelocking in UnalignedCheckpointITCase.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFix for test.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n`TestStreamEnvironment` only overrides `execute()` but not `executeAsync()`. Calls against the latter therefore don't use the shared `MiniCluster` but a new cluster is spun up for every job.\r\n\r\nThis changes `TestStreamEnvironment` to always use the shared `MiniCluster` by injecting a custom `PipelineExecutorServiceLoader` and not overriding any of the `execute*()` methods.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAs always, the commit messages describe what each commit does.\r\n\r\n - remodel `PerJobMiniClusterClient` to be usable for all `MiniCluster` job purposes\r\n - change `TestStreamEnvironment` to use a custom `PipelineExecutorServiceLoader`\r\n - the custom  `PipelineExecutorServiceLoader` goes directly against a `MiniCluster` instead of the `JobExecutor` because we want to do async job submission\r\n - remove now-unused `JobExecutor` interface\r\n\r\nThis quote describes the rationale behind removing `JobExecutor` and mentions an alternative solution:\r\n\r\n> Instead, we use a custom PipelineExecutorServiceLoader to inject a\r\n> MiniClusterExecutor. This requires that we directly use MiniCluster\r\n> instead of the JobExecutor interface in the test environments because we\r\n> need to use asynchronous job submission. The alternative would be to\r\n> extend the JobExecutor interface to allow async job submission.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nCovered by existing tests that use `TestStreamEnvironment`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR implements sorting inputs for multi input operators/tasks. It is based on the work in #13521\r\nFirst I sort all inputs individually and after that I do a sorting merge of all the inputs to make sure that operator sees all incoming records with the same key from all inputs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nFor a more thorough explanation see the commits messages. Some highlights:\r\n* Some of the commits refactor the TwoInputStreamProcessor/MultiInputStreamProcessor etc. to reduce code duplication\r\n* Some of the commits extract the instantiation logic out of the processor and moves it to the Task. It makes it a) easier to instantiate in tests b) we need to pass less arguments to the ctor from the Task\r\n* One of the commits implements proper `AvailabilityProvider` handling logic, which did not work before.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded tests in:\r\n* MultiInputSortingDataInputsTest\r\n* SortedDataInputITCase\r\n* SortingBoundedInputITCase.java \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-01T14:33:04Z","updated_at":"2020-10-12T17:14:35Z","closed_at":"2020-10-12T17:14:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"94793f05b9e798cddc0855f62d3e8b3eec4f25d6","assignee":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1401080710,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDAxMDgwNzEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Task","name":"component=Runtime/Task","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13529/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13529/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13529/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/993afb5f025963ba3695c31228a7b09dd8e2200c","head":{"label":"dawidwys:FLINK-19473","ref":"FLINK-19473","sha":"993afb5f025963ba3695c31228a7b09dd8e2200c","user":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43764900,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mzc2NDkwMA==","name":"flink","full_name":"dawidwys/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/ev
