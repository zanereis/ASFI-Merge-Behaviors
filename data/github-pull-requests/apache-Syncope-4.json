Bug-Fixes:</h2>\n<p>The main key-aspects that have been improved or being worked on are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>bump <code>jakarta.xml.bind:jakarta.xml.bind-api</code> from <code>4.0.1</code> to <code>4.0.2</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>bump <code>org.mockito:mockito-core</code> from <code>5.10.0</code> to <code>5.11.0</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/git-commit-id/git-commit-id-maven-plugin/issues/718\">#718</a>/<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/git-commit-id/git-commit-id-maven-plugin/issues/721\">#721</a>: replace <code>junit:junit:4.13.2:test</code> with <code>org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-*:5.10.2:test</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/git-commit-id/git-commit-id-maven-plugin/issues/717\">#717</a>/<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/git-commit-id/git-commit-id-maven-plugin/issues/720\">#720</a>: update <code>org.sonatype.plexus:plexus-build-api:0.0.7</code> to <code>org.codehaus.plexus:plexus-build-api:1.2.0</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>bump <code>org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-gpg-plugin</code> from <code>3.1.0</code> to <code>3.2.0</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>bump <code>org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-assembly-plugin</code> from <code>3.6.0</code> to <code>3.7.0</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/git-commit-id/git-commit-id-maven-plugin/issues/717\">#717</a>: Update <code>maven-plugin-api.version</code> from <code>3.9.2</code> to <code>3.9.6</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Getting the latest release</h2>\n<p>The plugin is available from Maven Central (<a href=\"https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.github.git-commit-id%20AND%20a:git-commit-id-maven-plugin\">see here</a>), so you don't have to configure any additional repositories to use this plugin. All you need to do is to configure it inside your project as dependency:</p>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;io.github.git-commit-id&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;git-commit-id-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;8.0.2&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Getting the latest snapshot (build automatically)</h2>\n<p>If you can't wait for the next release, you can also get the latest snapshot version from sonatype, that is being deployed automatically by github actions:</p>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>&lt;pluginRepositories&gt;\n    &lt;pluginRepository&gt;\n        &lt;id&gt;sonatype-snapshots&lt;/id&gt;\n        &lt;name&gt;Sonatype Snapshots&lt;/name&gt;\n         &lt;url&gt;https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/&lt;/url&gt;\n    &lt;/pluginRepository&gt;\n&lt;/pluginRepositories&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Even though the github actions will only deploy a new snapshot once all tests have finished, it is recommended to rely on the released and more stable version.</p>\n<h2>Known Issues / Limitations:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This plugin is unfortunately not working with Heroku which is due to the fact how Heroku works. In summary Heroku does not copy over the .git-repository but in order to determine the git properties this plugin relies on the fact that it has access to the git-repository. A somewhat <em>workaround</em> to get some information is outlined in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/ktoso/maven-git-commit-id-plugin/issues/279#issuecomment-301284022\">ktoso/maven-git-commit-id-plugin#279</a></li>\n<li>Using maven's plugin prefix resolution (e.g. <code>mvn com.test.plugins:myPlugin:myMojo</code>) might result in unresolved properties even with <code>&lt;injectAllReactorProjects&gt;true&lt;/injectAllReactorProjects&gt;</code>.

1.17.2</h2>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Attribute object accessors</strong>: Added <code>Element.attribute(String)</code> and <code>Attributes.attribute(String)</code> to more simply\nobtain an <code>Attribute</code> object. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2069\">2069</a></li>\n<li><strong>Attribute source tracking</strong>: If source tracking is on, and an Attribute's key is changed (\nvia <code>Attribute.setKey(String)</code>), the source range is now still tracked\nin <code>Attribute.sourceRange()</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2070\">2070</a></li>\n<li><strong>Wildcard attribute selector</strong>: Added support for the <code>[*]</code> element with any attribute selector. And also restored\nsupport for selecting by an empty attribute name prefix (<code>[^]</code>). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2079\">2079</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mixed-cased source position</strong>: When tracking the source position of attributes, if the source attribute name was\nmix-cased but the parser was lower-case normalizing attribute names, the source position for that attribute was not\ntracked correctly. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2067\">2067</a></li>\n<li><strong>Source position NPE</strong>: When tracking the source position of a body fragment parse, a null pointer\nexception was thrown. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2068\">2068</a></li>\n<li><strong>Multi-point emoji entity</strong>: A multi-point encoded emoji entity may be incorrectly decoded to the replacement\ncharacter. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2074\">2074</a></li>\n<li><strong>Selector sub-expressions</strong>: (Regression) in a selector like <code>parent [attr=va], other</code>, the <code>, OR</code> was binding\nto <code>[attr=va]</code> instead of <code>parent [attr=va]</code>, causing incorrect selections. The fix includes a EvaluatorDebug class\nthat generates a sexpr to represent the query, allowing simpler and more thorough query parse\ntests. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2073\">2073</a></li>\n<li><strong>XML CData output</strong>: When generating XML-syntax output from parsed HTML, script nodes containing (pseudo) CData\nsections would have an extraneous CData section added, causing script execution errors. Now, the data content is\nemitted in a HTML/XML/XHTML polyglot format, if the data is not already within a CData\nsection. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2078\">2078</a></li>\n<li><strong>Thread safety</strong>: The <code>:has</code> evaluator held a non-thread-safe Iterator, and so if an Evaluator object was\nshared across multiple concurrent threads, a NoSuchElement exception may be thrown, and the selected results may be\nincorrect.

Now, the iterator object is a thread-local. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2088\">2088</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Older changes for versions 0.1.1 (2010-Jan-31) through 1.17.1 (2023-Nov-27) may be found in\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/change-archive.txt\">change-archive.txt</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/9dec1baba5b3d0fa11268c95630b391f9de664ad\"><code>9dec1ba</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release jsoup-1.17.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/d3a572423233ff6ce4ff2892e60e4c80febc7b9c\"><code>d3a5724</code></a> Changelog for 1.17.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/1963a7c17fc8b95ec6f6d150d716c9d9c4065c2e\"><code>1963a7c</code></a> Bump org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin from 3.12.0 to 3.12.1 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2\">#2</a>...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/d4b2c36dadad3e644d1c1b5b85aa704b22c3b077\"><code>d4b2c36</code></a> Simplify node filtering operations using Streams API (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2080\">#2080</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/78be89abde691c066fd55a1ca24254447e21cfe6\"><code>78be89a</code></a> Move iter into Has class</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/374ded2bc3d57108fffbead844371ecc5fab63ee\"><code>374ded2</code></a> Use a threadlocal to hold the NodeIterator</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/4fb1036ce7892fa1f938cee4f37435e85dd30797\"><code>4fb1036</code></a> Bump org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin from 3.2.2 to 3.2.3 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2086\">#2086</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/c9ce65a9fec3cf6ddeb2dbe5d98214b6a03698b4\"><code>c9ce65a</code></a> Bump org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-failsafe-plugin from 3.2.2 to 3.2.3 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2085\">#2085</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/20c9162234e55a297cd1a2195af70d9353ab3e05\"><code>20c9162</code></a> Bump org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin from 3.11.0 to 3.12.0 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2\">#2</a>...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/d5bc100eab6238b4b682a45fc04e829ff46459ef\"><code>d5bc100</code></a> Corrected namespace tests</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/compare/jsoup-1.17.1...jsoup-1.17.2\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=org.jsoup:jsoup&package-manager=maven&previous-version=1.17.1&new-version=1.17.2)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
