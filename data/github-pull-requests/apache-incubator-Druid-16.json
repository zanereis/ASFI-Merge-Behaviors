#15615 added an optimization to avoid parsing numbers twice in cases where we know that they should definitely be longs or definitely be doubles. Rather than try parsing as long first, and then try parsing as double, it would use only the parsing routine specific to the requested outputType.\r\n\r\nThis caused a bug: previously, we would accept decimals like \"1.0\" or \"1.23\" as longs, by truncating them to \"1\". After that patch, we would treat such decimals as nulls when the outputType is set to LONG.\r\n\r\nThis patch retains the short-circuit for doubles: if outputType is DOUBLE, we only parse the string as a double. But for outputType LONG, this patch restores the old behavior: try to parse as long first, then

to this patch, kill tasks will delete all versions of unused segments within the specified interval. With this patch, users can now delete specific versions of unused data, while retaining the rest by specifying an optional list of `versions` in the kill task payload. If left unspecified, the default behavior remains unchanged, i.e., delete all versions of unused segments in the interval. \r\n\r\n**Motivation**:\r\n\r\n- A user may want to use this functionality for data compliance reasons - an ingestion job that created some bad data that needs to be deleted right away, while keeping other versions of the data around for sometime. \r\n- Manage storage costs: Keep only the last 'n' versions of unused segments in the deep storage.\r\n\r\nNote that adding an optional list of `versions` support to `/markAsUsed` and `/markAsUnused` segment management APIs would be a complementary addition. I didn't make those changes in this PR to keep it simple to review - I will follow up on that later.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

[io.grpc:grpc-netty-shaded](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java) from 1.57.2 to 1.62.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases\">io.grpc:grpc-netty-shaded's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.62.2</h2>\n<h2>gRPC Java 1.62.2 Release Notes</h2>\n<p>Note that this is the initial 1.62.x release</p>\n<h3>API Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>services: Remove <code>io.grpc.services.BinaryLogs</code>, which was deprecated since 2021. <code>io.grpc.protobuf.services.BinaryLogs</code> should be used instead (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10832\">#10832</a>).</li>\n<li>Allow users outside of io.grpc.xds package to create custom xDS resources (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10834\">#10834</a>) (6d96e6588)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>api:Add ClientTransportFilter.  Similarly to ServerTransportFilter, this will provide an observability hook and it allows direct modification of the transport's attributes. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10646\">#10646</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>java_grpc_library.bzl: Add support for Auto Exec Groups (cb03bd234). This is mostly a behind-the-scenes change to adjust to the newer way Bazel operates</li>\n<li>java_grpc_library.bzl: Support runfiles for protoc and the plugin (65a6b3bc2). Neither binary uses runfiles, but the task will be ready if they need to in the future</li>\n<li>xds: Add EC key support for XdsChannelCredentials/XdsServerCredentials (100d5a55f)</li>\n<li>binder:Change log level from WARNING to FINER for expected exception during close with error, to reduce log spamming (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10899\">#10899</a>) (7ba0718bb)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>xds: Fix a bug in WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer policy that could raise NullPointerException and further cause channel panic when picking a subchannel. This bug can only be triggered when connection can not be established and the channel reports TRANSIENT_FAILURE state. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10868\">#10868</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dependencies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The protoc plugin no longer supports macOS Big Sur (macOS 11). Binaries are now built using Monterey (macOS 12)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/joybestourous\"><code>@​joybestourous</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v1.61.1</h2>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<p>xds: Fix a bug in <code>WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer</code> policy that could raise <code>NullPointerException</code> and further cause channel panic when picking a subchannel. This bug can only be triggered when connection can not be established and the channel reports <code>TRANSIENT_FAILURE</code> state. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10868\">#10868</a>)</p>\n<h2>v1.61.0</h2>\n<h3>API Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove unused experimental API ManagedChannelBuilder.enableFullStreamDecompression (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10744\">#10744</a>)</li>\n<li>api: Deprecate LoadBalancer.EMPTY_PICKER added in 1.58.0 in favor of FixedResultPicker (860b5cb1f)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>binder: Experimental support for asynchronous security policies (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10566\">#10566</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>core: reduce CompositeReadableBuffer allocation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/3279\">#3279</a>)</li>\n<li>core: Improve error message clarity when a channel leak is detected (201893f5e)</li>\n<li>util: use shared index across <code>round_robin</code> pickers (dca89b25b). This makes its implementation more similar to <code>weighted_round_robin</code>.</li>\n<li>xds: Implement ADS stream flow control mechanism (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10674\">#10674</a>). This limits the maximum memory consumed if the control plane sends updates more rapidly than they can be processed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>core: Check outbound maximum message size for the compressed size in addition to the already-checked uncompressed size (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10739\">#10739</a>). Fixed the status code to be RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED instead of UNKNOWN.</li>\n<li>util: Fix NPE when multiple addresses are in an address group for petiole load balancer policies (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10769\">#10769</a>)</li>\n<li>util: Disable publishing of fixtures (8ac43dd81).

Description\r\n\r\nWhile converting `Sequence<ScanResultValue>` to `Sequence<Frames>`, when `maxSubqueryBytes` is enabled, we batch the results to prevent creating a single frame per `ScanResultValue.` Batching requires peeking into the actual value, and checking if the row signature of the scan result’s value matches that of the previous value. \r\n\r\nSince we can do this indefinitely (in the worst case all of them have the same signature), we keep fetching them and accumulating them in a list (on the heap). We don’t really know how much to batch before we actually write the value as frames.\r\n\r\nThe PR modifies the batching logic to not accumulate the results in an intermediary list.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14024 and additionally supports,\r\n* Native queries \r\n* gRPC health check endpoint \r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't have the shaded module for packaging gRPC and Guava libraries since `grpc-query` module uses the same Guava version as that of Druid. \r\n\r\nThe response is gRPC-specific. It provides the result schema along with the results as a binary \"blob\". Results can be in CSV, JSON array lines or as an array of Protobuf objects. If using Protobuf, the corresponding class must be installed along with the gRPC query extension so it is available to the Broker at runtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Example usage\r\n\r\nSample request, \r\n\r\n```java\r\nQueryRequest.newBuilder()\r\n            .setQuery(\"SELECT * FROM foo\")\r\n            .setResultFormat(QueryResultFormat.CSV)\r\n            .setQueryType(QueryOuterClass.QueryType.SQL)\r\n            .build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using Protobuf response format, bundle up your Protobuf classes\r\ninto a jar file, and place that jar file in the\r\n`$DRUID_HOME/extensions/grpc-query` directory. \r\nSpecify the response Protobuf message name in the request. \r\n\r\n```java\r\nQueryRequest.newBuilder()\r\n            .setQuery(\"SELECT dim1, dim2, dim3, cnt, m1, m2, unique_dim1, __time AS \"date\" FROM foo\")\r\n            .setQueryType(QueryOuterClass.QueryType.SQL)\r\n            .setProtobufMessageName(QueryResult.class.getName())\r\n            .setResultFormat(QueryResultFormat.PROTOBUF_INLINE)\r\n            .build();    \r\n            \r\nResponse message \r\nmessage QueryResult {\r\n  string dim1 = 1;\r\n  string dim2 = 2;\r\n  string dim3 = 3;\r\n  int64 cnt = 4;\r\n  float m1 = 5;\r\n  double m2 = 6;\r\n  bytes unique_dim1 = 7;\r\n  google.protobuf.Timestamp date = 8;\r\n}          \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Description\r\n\r\nA single compaction task could be splitted the into multiple index tasks based on the interval given in spec.

Description\r\nFixes #15979\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue #15979 of duplicated mock creation code across multiple test classes within the Apache Druid project. By introducing the `CreateMockColumnValueSelector.java` utility class, I aim to centralize the creation of mocked `ColumnValueSelector` objects, thereby enhancing code reusability and simplifying maintenance.\r\n\r\nIn the course of testing, particularly within the `ArrayDoubleGroupByColumnSelectorStrategyTest`, `ArrayLongGroupByColumnSelectorStrategyTest`, and `ArrayStringGroupByColumnSelectorStrategyTest` classes, I identified a pattern of duplicate code concerning mock object creation. This redundancy not only bloats the test code but also introduces unnecessary complexity.\r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\n\r\nThe newly introduced `CreateMockColumnValueSelector` class provides a streamlined approach to generating mocked `ColumnValueSelector` instances, equipped with predefined behaviors. This approach significantly reduces the boilerplate code in our test suite and improves the readability and maintainability of our tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n\r\n- `CreateMockColumnValueSelector`\r\n- Modified:\r\n  - `ArrayDoubleGroupByColumnSelectorStrategyTest`\r\n  - `ArrayLongGroupByColumnSelectorStrategyTest`\r\n  - `ArrayStringGroupByColumnSelectorStrategyTest`\r\n\r\nBy doing this, code repetition can be reduced. Make the test code clearer\r\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this proposal!

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances task management capabilities by introducing two features: Task Labeling and Task Scheduling, utilizing the available task slots in the Kubernetes Task Runner. These features are designed to manage a diverse array of task types more efficiently, particularly addressing the complexities of Multi-Stage Query (MSQ) tasks that perform varied functions. These enhancements are designed to provide granular control over task execution and extend the capabilities for monitoring and analysis of task performance.\r\n\r\n**Task Labeling**\r\nWe've integrated a Task Label Concept to explicitly clarify each task's purpose. This concept allows for distinguishing between tasks that, although of the same type, serve different operational roles within Druid's ecosystem. Task labeling enables more precise monitoring, reporting, and management of tasks based on their designated labels.\r\n(a separate PR created for this change for easier review https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16041)\r\n\r\n**Task Scheduling**\r\nEnhancements to Task Scheduling leverage task labels to optimize the allocation of Kubernetes task slots. This ensures that tasks are scheduled according to their operational priority and resource requirements, leading to improved cluster capacity management. The example configuration demonstrates the application of this feature:\r\n1. limit the admin tasks (`kill,compact`) to use max 10% of the cluster capacity.\r\n2. limit querying from deep storage task (`msq_export_durable_storage`) to use max 20% of the cluster capacity.\r\n3. Reserve 60% of cluster capacity for (critical) ingestion tasks (`index_parallel,msq_index_batch`)\r\n```\r\ndruid.indexer.runner.taskLanes=[\r\n  {\"labels\":\"kill,compact\",\"capacityRatio\":\"0.1\",\"policy\":\"MAX\"},\r\n  {\"labels\":\"msq_export_durable_storage\",\"capacityRatio\":\"0.2\",\"policy\":\"MAX\"},\r\n  {\"labels\":\"index_parallel,msq_index_batch\",\"capacityRatio\":\"0.6\",\"policy\":\"RESERVE\"}\r\n]\r\n```\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

So we increment the counter and then send the request.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\nCurrently if a connection of server is blocked in creating a future job to run the query, it is not being counted resulting in the selector strategy allotting a new connection to same server. \r\nFixed this behaviour by incrementing the connection count prior to  the start of future.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DirectDruidClient`\r\n * `DirectDruidClientTest`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFixes a couple of issues with `ARRAY_CONTAINS` and `ARRAY_OVERLAP` and null handling. First is now if the left side is null the functions will correctly return null. This was also an issue in the SQL planner layer, where boolean typed constants were never created as null literals if the boolean expression was nullable, which has been fixed as well. The type inference of these functions now reflects that a null left side argument makes the function return type nullable.\r\n\r\nThis PR also changes how `MV_CONTAINS` and `MV_OVERLAP` are planned into native expressions to behave consistently with the native filter rewrites used, adding a new native `mv_harmonize_nulls` expression which coerces `null` and `[]` into `[null]`.\r\n\r\nFinally, i adjusted about how the 'singleThreaded' stuff works with `Expr` to allow built-in `Function` to be able to do some of the same optimizations we do with `ExprMacro`, such as optimize when an argument is a constant. The change is moving the method to a default implementation on `Expr`\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * Possibly convert the {@link Expr} into an optimized, possibly not thread-safe {@link Expr}. Does not convert\r\n   * child {@link Expr}. Most callers should use {@link Expr#singleThreaded(Expr, InputBindingInspector)} to convert\r\n   * an entire tree, which delegates to this method to translate individual nodes.\r\n   */\r\n  default Expr asSingleThreaded(InputBindingInspector inspector)\r\n  {\r\n    return this;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe real change here is that these methods now accept a `InputBindingInspector` so that `Expr` can analyze inputs such as to compute output type and the like. The javadocs try to be clear that most callers shouldn't be calling this method directly since it only translates a single layer of `Expr`.\r\n\r\n`Function` has a similar method:\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * Possibly convert a {@link Function} into an optimized, possibly not thread-safe {@link Function}.\r\n   */\r\n  default Function asSingleThreaded(List<Expr> args, Expr.InputBindingInspector inspector)\r\n  {\r\n    return this;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nwhich `FunctionExpr` takes advantage of:\r\n```\r\n  @Override\r\n  public Expr asSingleThreaded(InputBindingInspector inspector)\r\n  {\r\n    return new FunctionExpr(\r\n        function.asSingleThreaded(args, inspector),\r\n        name,\r\n        args\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nallowing any function to specialize itself before computation. The only ones I've done so far are `array_contains` and `array_overlap`, but i'm sure there are plenty of others that could benefit.\r\n\r\nIt does make an improvement. Given queries:\r\n```\r\n      \"SELECT ARRAY_CONTAINS(\\\"multi-string3\\\", 100) FROM foo\",\r\n      \"SELECT ARRAY_CONTAINS(\\\"multi-string3\\\", ARRAY[1, 2, 10, 11, 20, 22, 30, 33, 40, 44, 50, 55, 100]) FROM foo\",\r\n      \"SELECT ARRAY_OVERLAP(\\\"multi-string3\\\", ARRAY[1, 100]) FROM foo\",\r\n      \"SELECT ARRAY_OVERLAP(\\\"multi-string3\\\", ARRAY[1, 2, 10, 11, 20, 22, 30, 33, 40, 44, 50, 55, 100]) FROM foo\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt     Score     Error

pretty clean, to optimize `Function` implementations only need to implement `asSingleThreaded` and allow it to pick internally defined class that overrides the `apply` method.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis

Description\r\nFixes `regexp_like`, `contains_string`, and `icontains_string` to return `null` instead of `false` in SQL compatible null handling mode to have correct three-value logic behavior. I did not put this behavior behind a flag, though if we are worried about the bug fix changing behavior I suppose we could associate it with `NullHandling.useThreeValueLogic()`, though kind of weird since that is currently tied to use for native filters, or `ExpressionProcessing.useStrictBooleans()` which traditionally controls the other expression related 3vl stuff.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n`REGEXP_LIKE`, `CONTAINS_STRING`, and `ICONTAINS_STRING` correctly return null for null value inputs in SQL compatible null handling mode (the default configuration).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR contains a portion of the changes from the inactive draft PR for integrating the catalog with the Calcite planner https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13686 from @paul-rogers, tables that are defined in the catalog will have their simple dimension defined column types validated against source input expressions mapped to them during DML INSERT/REPLACE operations. Complex measure types columns will not be validated at this time, this will come in a follow up pr. Also enforcing sealed / non-sealed mode; if a table is sealed, no undefined columns may be added to the table during ingestion. Also addressing remaining comments from https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15836 and https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15908.\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

to this patch, an incorrect `PARTITIONED BY` clause can expose options like `NONE` in the returned error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nInvalid granularity[foo] specified after PARTITIONED BY clause. Expected SECOND, MINUTE, FIVE_MINUTE, TEN_MINUTE, FIFTEEN_MINUTE, THIRTY_MINUTE, HOUR, SIX_HOUR, EIGHT_HOUR, DAY, MONTH, QUARTER, YEAR, ALL, NONE, ALL TIME, FLOOR() or TIME_FLOOR()\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, some of these granularities like `SECOND` and `MINUTE` are reserved SQL keywords that are not handled explicitly in Druid. In order for them to be properly used they should be quoted as literals. So single quote the granularity literals in the error message making it clear to a user about the correct usage.\r\n\r\nOther related changes:\r\n- A general overall clean up of `DruidSqlParserUtils.java`:\r\n  - A mix of Precondition checks, ValidationException and DruidException were thrown making the calling code catch these different exceptions and unify them. So migrate all the exception handling usages in this class to DruidException and add additional context to messages as needed.\r\n  - Remove unused method, modify a few method access modifiers, removed/added `@VisibleForTesting`, etc.\r\n- Added a couple of tests for the literal granularity case noted above.\r\n- Fix up some typos and inaccuracies in the javadocs for the partitioned by area of code.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DruidSqlParserUtils.java`\r\n * `DruidSqlParserUtilsTest.java`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFixes a mistake in expression virtual column indexes introduced in #15585, which would incorrectly return `null` from the index supplier, which is a signal to downstream filters that the column is all nulls, even for expressions which translate null values into not null values. This affects filters on stuff like `nvl`, `coalesce`, 3 argument `lookup`, etc. when filtering for the replaced value, for example: ` ... WHERE NVL(col, 'replaced') = 'replaced'`. The workaround I suppose is to just filter for `is null` without nvl/coalesce/etc.\r\n\r\nThe added test would incorrectly fail the 2nd case.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

PR adds the capability for MSQ export to create a manifest file at the destination. \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nCurrently, export creates the files at the provided destination. The addition of the manifest file will provide a list of files created as part of the manifest. This will allow easier consumption of the data exported from Druid, especially for automated data pipelines. There is still a safety check that requires the destination to be empty, but this would be especially helpful if that condition is relaxed in the future. Druid currently does not support reading from a manifest file.\r\n\r\n### Structure\r\n\r\nThe manifest file created is in the `symlink manifest format`. The file is created at the \r\npath `<export destination>/_symlink_format_manifest/manifest`. Normally, this would be `<export destination>/_symlink_format_manifest/<partition path>/manifest`, but since Druid does not support partitioning, the manifest is always created in the _symlink_format_manifest folder itself. Each line of the file contains an absolute path to a file created by the export. \r\nThe path is prefixed by `file:` if the destination is on a local disk.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a file `_symlink_format_manifest/druid_export_meta` is created. The file contains additional information about the export. Currently, this only contains the manifest file version, to track which version of the manifest file was created by the export.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\nLocal storage:\r\n```\r\n└[~/export]> cat _symlink_format_manifest/manifest\r\nfile:/Users/adarshsanjeev/export/query-293c1f4c-d5ed-4b04-9690-d7d2d9db4995-worker2-partition23.csv\r\nfile:/Users/adarshsanjeev/export/query-293c1f4c-d5ed-4b04-9690-d7d2d9db4995-worker1-partition13.csv\r\nfile:/Users/adarshsanjeev/export/query-293c1f4c-d5ed-4b04-9690-d7d2d9db4995-worker0-partition24.csv\r\n...\r\nfile:/Users/adarshsanjeev/export/query-293c1f4c-d5ed-4b04-9690-d7d2d9db4995-worker1-partition1.csv\r\n```\r\nS3 export file:\r\n\r\nFile created at s3://export-bucket/export/_symlink_format_manifest/manifest\r\n```\r\ns3://export-bucket/export/query-6564a32f-2194-423a-912e-eead470a37c4-worker2-partition2.csv\r\ns3://export-bucket/export/query-6564a32f-2194-423a-912e-eead470a37c4-worker1-partition1.csv\r\ns3://export-bucket/export/query-6564a32f-2194-423a-912e-eead470a37c4-worker0-partition0.csv\r\n...\r\ns3://export-bucket/export/query-6564a32f-2194-423a-912e-eead470a37c4-worker0-partition24.csv\r\n```\r\ndruid_export_meta:\r\n```\r\nversion: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nExport is still an experimental feature, and the structure of the file could be changed in the future.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### Upgrade issues\r\n\r\n- During a rolling update, older versions of workers would not return a list of exported files, and older controller would not create a manifest file. Therefore, export queries run during this time might have incomplete manifests.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n**Release notes**\r\n- Export queries will also create a manifest file at the destination, which lists the files created by the query.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

The complexity for this operation is O(n ^ 2) for each interval with n segments.\r\nThis can lead to coordinator polls happening infrequently, which causes a delay in segments being discovered after having been committed, which leads to stale data and slow handoffs etc.\r\n\r\nOptimize the isOvershadowed method when there there is a single value of minorVersion across all segments in an interval (When segment locking is not used, for example) to reduce the complexity to O(n) in such cases.\r\nThis is a simple optimization that may be useful for most large clusters since segment locking is seldom used.\r\n\r\nBENCHMARKS:\r\n`VersionedIntervalTimelineBenchmark#benchIsOvershadowedTotal`\r\nBenchmarks were run with 1000 / 10000 segments per interval with Monthly granularity over a year.\r\n\r\nExisting code:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                                    (numInitialRootGenSegmentsPerInterval)  (numNonRootGenerations)  (segmentGranularity)  (useSegmentLock)   Mode  Cnt  Score    Error  Units\r\nVersionedIntervalTimelineBenchmark.benchIsOvershadowedTotal                                    1000                        1                 MONTH             false  thrpt    3  0.347 ±  0.030  ops/s\r\nVersionedIntervalTimelineBenchmark.benchIsOvershadowedTotal                                    1000                        1                 MONTH              true  thrpt    3  0.366 ±  0.033  ops/s\r\nVersionedIntervalTimelineBenchmark.benchIsOvershadowedTotal                                    1000                        2                 MONTH             false  thrpt    3  0.343 ±  0.015  ops/s\r\nVersionedIntervalTimelineBenchmark.benchIsOvershadowedTotal                                    1000                        2                 MONTH              true  thrpt    3  0.365 ±  0.033  ops/s\r\nVersionedIntervalTimelineBenchmark.benchIsOvershadowedTotal                                   10000                        1                 MONTH             false  thrpt    3  0.004 ±  0.001  ops/s\r\nVersionedIntervalTimelineBenchmark.benchIsOvershadowedTotal                                   10000                        1                 MONTH              true  thrpt    3  0.004 ±  0.001  ops/s\r\nVersionedIntervalTimelineBenchmark.benchIsOvershadowedTotal                                   10000                        2                 MONTH             false  thrpt    3  0.003 ±  0.001  ops/s\r\nVersionedIntervalTimelineBenchmark.benchIsOvershadowedTotal                                   10000                        2                 MONTH              true  thrpt    3  0.004 ±  0.001  ops/s\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this patch:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                                    (numInitialRootGenSegmentsPerInterval)  (numNonRootGenerations)  (segmentGranularity)  (useSegmentLock)   Mode  Cnt   Score    Error  Units\r\nVersionedIntervalTimelineBenchmark.benchIsOvershadowedTotal                                    1000                        1                 MONTH             false  thrpt    3  82.062 ±  5.082  ops/s\r\nVersionedIntervalTimelineBenchmark.benchIsOvershadowedTotal                                    1000                        1                 MONTH              true  thrpt    3  80.937 ± 33.370  ops/s\r\nVersionedIntervalTimelineBenchmark.benchIsOvershadowedTotal                                    1000                        2                 MONTH             false  thrpt    3  59.582 ±  6.060  ops/s\r\nVersionedIntervalTimelineBenchmark.benchIsOvershadowedTotal                                    1000                        2                 MONTH              true  thrpt    3  59.314 ±  9.134  ops/s\r\nVersionedIntervalTimelineBenchmark.benchIsOvershadowedTotal                                   10000                        1                 MONTH             false  thrpt    3   8.165 ±  0.675  ops/s\r\nVersionedIntervalTimelineBenchmark.benchIsOvershadowedTotal                                   10000                        1                 MONTH              true  thrpt    3   8.193 ±  0.431  ops/s\r\nVersionedIntervalTimelineBenchmark.benchIsOvershadowedTotal                                   10000                        2                 MONTH             false  thrpt    3   5.831 ±  1.910  ops/s\r\nVersionedIntervalTimelineBenchmark.benchIsOvershadowedTotal                                   10000                        2                 MONTH              true  thrpt    3   5.927 ±  0.421  ops/s\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- Add tests to ensure correctness of the new method\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   -

Description\r\n\r\nThis adds visibility into number of segments read/published by each parallel compaction task.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new subclass for `IngestionStatsAndErrorsTaskReportData` to take new fields and `ParallelIndexSupervisorTask` to populate the segments read/published in different parallel compaction algos.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nParallel compaction task completion reports now have segmentsRead and segmentsPublished fields to see how effective a compaction task is. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n *

PR makes a few functional and non-functional changes in the auto-kill `KillUnusedSegments` duty.\r\n\r\nFunctional changes:\r\n\r\n- Add a new metric `kill/eligibleUnusedSegments/count` with dimension `dataSource` that tracks the number of candidate unused segments per datasource per kill cycle. It's candidate because it's the kill task that ultimately kills the unused segments and the number can change.\r\n- Move a debug log to info for improved visibility. This should be fine as it gets logged only once per indexing/kill task period.\r\n- Change the kill duty DruidException validations from user to operator persona as they're configured by operators typically.\r\n\r\nRefactoring changes:\r\n- Remove redundant checks in the code for code readability.\r\n- Remove all the unnecessary `@VisibleForTesting`  annotations as the test code now verifies the duty directly instead of mocks + various hooks into the code.\r\n- Finalize some parameters and variables to clarify the intent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTesting changes:\r\n- Updated tests from using mocks (the mocks were difficult to use and buggy - for example, last updated timestamp was never used.\r\n- Fix a bug where `TestDruidCoordinatorConfig.DEFAULT_COORDINATOR_KILL_BUFFER_PERIOD` was incorrectly set to 1 day instead of 90 days. While at it, I changed all the test coordinator defaults to match the same ISO 8601 period format as `DruidCoordinatorConfig`, so it's easy to spot check.\r\n- Add more test coverage for the different config parameters.\r\n- Add a couple of unit tests that are ignored currently as they fail. The duty doesn't consider segments spanning eternity, or end in `DateTimes.MAX` (outside the normal Datetime string comparison range): https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/15951\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nIn general, I found it difficult to track the progress of the auto-kill coordinator duty. Also, see some discussion in the community slack: https://apachedruidworkspace.slack.com/archives/C0303FDCZEZ/p1707941058448649.\r\nMy preliminary conclusion from looking at a couple of clusters is that the auto-kill defaults are overly conservative and need to be revisited as https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/15912 notes.  I would like to address some of the concerns raised in https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/15911 and https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/15912 separately once we have some additional data and tests from this patch. \r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd a new metric `kill/eligibleUnusedSegments/count` with dimension `dataSource` that tracks the number of eligible unused segments of a datasource that are eligible for deletion by the coordinator.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KillUnusedSegments.java`\r\n * `KillUnusedSegmentsTest.java`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

individual implementations know better when they should and should not retry. They can also generate better error messages.\r\n\r\nMost network-based deep storage implementations already have logic for retrying, except HDFS, which I added in this patch, and Azure. It looks like the Azure client itself may have some built-in retry stuff, but I'm not totally sure. That one might also need retry wrapping. If anyone has experience with Azure and knows the answer to this, please let me know. For now, I've left it without retry wrapping.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for this patch was a situation where EntityTooLarge was generated by the S3DataSegmentPusher, and retried uselessly by the retry harness in PartialSegmentMergeTask. Other related changes in this patch include:\r\n\r\n- Adds an error message that spells out the problem, and potential fix, when a S3 upload attempt for a segment fails because it exceeds 5GB.\r\n- Stops unconditionally retrying on non-retryable S3 errors.\r\n- Updates the documentation to clarify that there is in some cases a cap on the max segment size.","created_at":"2024-02-21T21:51:23Z","updated_at":"2024-05-06T08:29:11Z","closed_at":"2024-03-04T18:36:21Z","merged_at":"2024-03-04T18:36:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"930655ff189dabf423a892207e3773715dd31e1f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nThis adds visibility into number of partitions processed by each streaming task and the count of records processed from each of those partitions.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `IngestionStatsAndErrorsTaskReportData` to take new map which represent count by partition and `SeekableStreamIndexTaskRunner` populates that map while processing each record. We are trying to analyze the work done by each task so as to efficiently assign appropriate resources in future to the worker nodes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nStreaming Task completion report now has an extra field `recordsProcessed ` which lists all the partitions processed by that task and count of records for each partition. One can look at this field to see the actual throughput of tasks and make decision as to vertically/horizontally scale there workers.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SeekableStreamIndexTaskRunner.java`\r\n * `IngestionStatsAndErrorsTaskReportData.java`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR tries to address an issue of \"web console tab context poisoning\" that is when a web console user re-uses a tab by deleting the SQL query in the tab and writing/pasting a new one. The user might forget that deleting all the SQL does not clear the context parameters which will be attached to subsequent queries issued.\r\n\r\nSpecifically here is a scenario that is of concern:\r\n- User plays with the \"Connect external data\" flow which creates a new tab for them with `arrayIngestMode: array` set (as was added in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15588)\r\n- After sometime, the user comes back and re-uses that tab by selecting the entire SQL query and pasting over some REPLACE/INSERT query into their production datasource that contains MVDs to do some fix up. They do not realize that while they cleared the SQL query, `arrayIngestMode: array` is still set in the query context in that tab.\r\n- The MVD columns become mixed with ARRAYs and some queries against these columns start working in unexpected ways.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes two changes (in two respective commits):\r\n\r\n1) Change it so that the `arrayIngestMode: array` context parameter is only set when the user has opted in to arrays (via the toggle that is off by default). Currently `arrayIngestMode: array` is always being set by all UI flows and the toggle only affects the SQL that is generated.\r\n  This change affects:\r\n  - The \"Connect external data\" wizard flow\r\n  - The \"SQL data loader\"\r\n  - The spec to SQL converter (in this case `arrayIngestMode: array` is only set if the ingestion spec is detected as using arrays by having dimensions specs of type \"auto\" + \"castToType: ARRAY<...>\")\r\n\r\n2) Make the `arrayIngestMode` selection more prominent in the UI so that it is shown on the \"Run panel\" and is not hidden inside of a menu.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/177816/7d542adb-8aaa-495c-b4d7-2c3ad405b7df)\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-19T18:00:45Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T20:04:25Z","closed_at":"2024-03-13T20:04:22Z","merged_at":"2024-03-13T20:04:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"ccae19a5468e0e1a39c788d7eb3a8f4b61a52d55","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1251906357,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUxOTA2MzU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Web%20Console","name":"Area

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis add a new `json_merge` expression which takes two or more arguments to merge into a single json structure. It also added the corresponding SQL function. This is useful for transforming data in druid, for instance I use it for flattening arrays of objects using fold, e.g. `fold((a, acc) -> json_merge(acc, json_object(json_value(a, '$.key'), json_value(a, '$.value'))), arrayofkv, json_object())`\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `json_merge` expression function\r\n * `json_merge` sql function\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFixes a bug when the undocumented `castToType` parameter is set on `'auto'` column schema, which should have been using the 'nullable' comparator to allow null values to be present when merging columns, but wasn't which would lead to null pointer exceptions. Also fixes an issue I noticed while adding tests that if 'FLOAT' type was specified for the `castToType` parameter it would be an exception because that type is not expected to be present, since 'auto' uses the native expressions to determine the input types and expressions don't have direct support for floats, only doubles.\r\n\r\nIn the future I should probably split this functionality out of the 'auto' schema (maybe even have a simpler version of the auto indexer dedicated to handling non-nested data) but still have the same results of writing out the newer 'nested common format' columns used by 'auto', but I haven't taken that on in this PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

multi-value strings and string arrays coexist in the same column, it causes problems with \"classic MVD\" style queries such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  select * from wikipedia -- fails at runtime\r\n  select count(*) from wikipedia where flags = 'B' -- fails at planning time\r\n  select flags, count(*) from wikipedia group by 1 -- fails at runtime\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo avoid these problems, this patch adds type verification for INSERT and REPLACE. It is targeted: the only type changes that are blocked are string-to-array and array-to-string. There is also a way to exclude certain columns from the type checks, if the user really knows what they're doing.\r\n\r\nThe patch includes new documentation about `arrayIngestMode`; see `docs/querying/arrays.md`. Other mentions of it throughout the docs are updated to link to this section.\r\n\r\nError scenarios:\r\n\r\n**Write SQL ARRAY to existing ARRAY field in `arrayIngestMode: mvd`**\r\n\r\n> Cannot write into field[arrayString] using type[VARCHAR ARRAY] and arrayIngestMode[mvd], since the existing type is[VARCHAR ARRAY]. Try setting arrayIngestMode to[array] to retain the SQL type[VARCHAR ARRAY].

[#15875.](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/15875)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen running the default docker image, we rely on the logic that transformers env variables into runtime properties for easier configuration (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/distribution/docker/druid.sh#L147)\r\n\r\nThis will transform a env variable like druid_metadata_storage_type=mysql into a runtime prop entry of druid.metadata.storage.type=mysql.\r\n\r\nThere is a bug with properties that use underscores like druid.indexer.runner.k8s.podTemplate.index_kafka since those have underscores, they will not get properly replaced. e.g. druid_indexer_runner_k8s_podTemplate_index_kafka will get replaced with druid.indexer.runner.k8s.podTemplate.index.kafka instead of druid.indexer.runner.k8s.podTemplate.index_kafka \r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough its not ideal to have underscores in runtime props (convention seems to be that runtime props should be camelCase), there is nothing preventing underscores in runtime props and in this case the runtime props are just matching our task type names.\r\n\r\nI fixed this bug by adding the ability to escape underscores in runtime props by including double underscores.\r\ne.g. druid_indexer_runner_k8s_podTemplate_index__kafka will properly be evaluated to druid.indexer.runner.k8s.podTemplate.index_kafka now.\r\n\r\nI used a double underscore as the escape character instead of \\_ because these character go in the env variable name\r\n\r\nI added two additional sed lines to the env variable parser to parse these double underscores.\r\n#### Release note\r\nAllow specifying runtime props with underscores through env variables in the docker image with a escape character.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `peon.sh`\r\n *

Description\r\nThis PR adds support for numeric arrays for columnar frame types. Columnar frame types are used in window functions processing and materializing subquery results, therefore it fixes up a major hole in the current capabilities of those.\r\n\r\n### Layout of the column\r\n\r\nFor storing a column of n rows, it is laid out in the following fashion. Assume that the total number of the elements (i.e. individual values in the array) in all the rows combined is k:\r\n| Section | Length of the section | Value |\r\n|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| | 0 | Type info, representing the column type |\r\n| 1 | `n * Integer.BYTES` | n integers, where i-th integer represents cumulative row length  |\r\n| 2 | `k * Byte.BYTES` | k bytes, where i-th byte represent whether the k-th value (from the start is null)  |\r\n| 3 | `k * ELEMENT_SIZE` | k values, each representing the element, or null equivalent value (e.g 0 for double) | \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nColumnar frames used in subquery materialization and window functions now support numeric arrays. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/15886\r\n### Description\r\nThe previous call `Collection<NamedType> taskSubtypes = mapper.getSubtypeResolver().collectAndResolveSubtypesByClass(config, cls);` to get the list of subtask names for loading per-taskType pod templates was not including task types included via extensions like index_kinesis and index_kafka. Because of this, if you define druid.indexer.runner.k8s.podTemplate.index_kafka, the KubernetesTaskRunner will still use druid.indexer.runner.k8s.podTemplate.base as the base template for tasks.\r\n\r\nIn order to fix this bug, rather than try to come up with a fixed list of all possible task types, I updated the logic to look for task templates for all properties defined under druid.indexer.runner.k8s.podTemplate.*. I think this does a better job of future-proofing any additional task types we may want to support.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `PodTemplateTaskAdapter`\r\n * `PodTemplateTaskAdapterTest`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

`LazilyDecoratedRowsAndColumns` doesn't contain the column its not being materialized as the column is not found\r\n* `rowSignature` contains all columns; but `null` types around the creation of  the `StorageAdapter`  in `ArrayListRowsAndColumns\r\n* `ArrayListSegment` has the same kind of rowSignature \r\n* `inlineDataSource.getRowSignature()` returns this kind of signature in `InlineSegmentWrangler`\r\n* `ClientQuerySegmentWalker` passes the signature along\r\n* `ScanQueryQueryToolChest#resultArraySignature` comes up with the signature\r\n* `ScanQueryQueryToolChest#getDataSourceColumnType` can’t handle `TableDataSource` so it returns `null` for all columns…\r\n\r\n### Options \r\n\r\n* enable `TableDatasource`  to supply a `rowSignature`\r\n  * in general probably `Datasource` should have that\r\n* enhance `ScanQuery` to retain a valid `RowSignature` somehow\r\n\r\n### Choosen approach\r\n\r\nI've choosen the second approach for now; as the first might be a broader change\r\n* the `ScanQuery` already had the name of the selected `columns`\r\n* added `columnTypes` list to be abke to promote the list of column to `RowSignature`\r\n* if both of them are available - a `RowSignature` is constructed and the above issue goes away\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFix NPE raised when only an order was applied to a result of subquery with limit.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency

Description\r\nFixes an issue of the SQL return type inference of `PARSE_LONG`, which was incorrectly using cascade nullable when instead it is always nullable (such as a non-null input string not being able to be parsed into a number). This becomes problematic when used in a filter involving nulls as the planner would incorrectly optimize it to always true/false depending on is null/ not null.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR contains a portion of the changes from the inactive draft PR for integrating the catalog with the Calcite planner https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13686 from @paul-rogers, Refactoring the IngestHandler and subclasses to produce a validated SqlInsert instance node instead of the previous Insert source node. The SqlInsert node is then validated in the calcite validator. The validation that is implemented as part of this pr, is only that for the source node, and some of the validation that was previously done in the ingest handlers. As part of this change, the partitionedBy clause can be supplied by the table catalog metadata if it exists, and can be omitted from the ingest time query in this case.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

This was causing flakiness for some test runs where values would end up out of order.\r\n\r\nThe existing problem is that toMap doesn't turn some values into json primitive values, for example segmentMetadata just has DateTime objects for it's time in the EventMap, but Alert event converts those into strings when calling toMap. This creates an issue because when we check the emitted events the mapper deserializing the string value for dateTime leaves it as a string in the EventMap. So the question is do we alter the events toMap() to return string/map version of objects or to make the expected events do a round trip of eventMap -> string -> eventMap to turn everything into json primitives\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

in Calcite NVL is converted to a case statement. Internally NVL(a,b) translates into CASE when a is not null then a else b. 1 occ of a gets replaced by 2. So recursive uses of NVL will be exponential. \r\n\r\nOne solution to this is to not allow the NVL to be evaluated as case statements. The calcite rewrite of NVL to CASE isn't useful for Druid, since with https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15609 we rewrite the CASE back to COALESCE right after validation, before the cost-based planner runs\r\n\r\nI discussed this with @kgyrtkirk and this is an initial solution for recursive NVLs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

`KafkaEmitterTest#testAllEventsWithCommonTopic` sometimes flakes. It's easy to reproduce the flakiness in IntelliJ using the \"Run the test until failure\" feature. The fix is in https://github.com/apache/druid/commit/a88369c68bea144895670ffe417d4818c60cceb7 - the producer callback can trigger concurrently and override the map initialization.\r\n\r\n/cc: @zachjsh @TSFenwick \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Dynamic table appaned `TABLE(APPEND(...))`\r\n\r\nThis is essentially an SQL level syntactic sugar which matches columns by name from multiple tables.\r\nSuppose you have 3 tables:\r\n* `table1` has `column1`\r\n* `table2` has `column2`\r\n* `table3` has `column1`, `column2`, `column3`\r\n\r\nIt is possible to create an union view of the above tables is possible by using UNION ALL:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT column1,NULL AS column2,NULL AS column3 FROM table1\r\nUNION ALL\r\nSELECT NULL AS column1,column2,NULL AS column3 FROM table2\r\nUNION ALL\r\nSELECT column1,column2,column3 FROM table3\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever depending on the size of the table's schema it might be quite complicated to do that; `TABLE(APPEND('table1','table2','table3'))` represents the same in a more compact form.\r\n\r\nIt adds one additional thing\r\n* if a column may have conflicting types (same column defined with different types in the inputs) - `ColumnType.leastRestrictive` is used to get a common type for them\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nIntroduce dynamic table append - `SELECT * FROM TABLE(APPEND('table1','table2'))` implicitly creates an union based on the table schemas.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes

Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KafkaEmitterTest`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR reverts the changes made between Druid 28 and Druid 29 to the ranger extension because the version bump adds `aws-java-sdk-bundle` as a transitive dependency. This bloats up the resulting build's size by a lot (~600MB previously, to ~900MB post the upgrade)\r\nThis isn't a long-term solution, and the ideal fix would be to exclude the `aws-java-sdk-bundle` and figure out which aws libraries the dependency requires (Cloudwatch, I think), and manually provide those dependencies.

\r\nGeo spatial column in druid at present stores coordinate as CSV string in string column and does RTree based indexing while ingestion. RTree based index are created based on the Float values of coordinates and not double, this conversion basically looses the accuracy of up 111 meters in geo distance. \r\n\r\nFor querying, druid support geo filters like Rectangle, Radius and Polygon with float precision, thus if user enters double precision coordinate then it looses the actual precision by at max 111 meters. \r\n\r\n\r\n**What are the remediation steps?** \r\nWe can not change the RTree indexing data type from float to double, it will not be backward compatible change. But we can very much prevent the precious loss at the Spatial filter level and at least compare with accurate coordinates with underline float RTree indexing. This will improve the accuracy but wont fix it 100 %. \r\n\r\nWe are working on one more Improvement Proposal for implementing Geo Complex column double precision and this PR is mandatory for that change anyways.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.
