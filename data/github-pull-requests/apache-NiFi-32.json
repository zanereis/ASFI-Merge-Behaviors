Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10697](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10697) Refactors unit tests in `nifi-toolkit` modules using JUnit 5. \r\n\r\nAll tests use JUnit 5 Jupiter components, with the exception of `ConfigEncryptionToolTest`, which is written in Groovy and contains a very large number of methods that should be handled in a separate issue. Aside from general replacement, particular changes include removing the `RegistryManualIT`, which is not executed in automated builds, and streamlining `EncryptConfigMainTest` to avoid methods that are duplicative of `ConfigEncryptionToolTest`.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

And I use `Collections `and `Comparator` to reorder the whole list before comparing them.\r\nThus the added lines seem excessive.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis test avoids different orders of ArrayList strings that cause flaky errors.\r\nSince I didn't touch any Source code, it should be no impact on the project.\r\nAnd it passed the local test that the guidelines mentioned.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10667](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10667) Adds a new `PrivateKeyService` Controller Service interface and `StandardPrivateKeyService` implementation capable of reading encrypted or unencrypted Private Keys.\r\n\r\nThe service interface is defined in a new `nifi-key-service-api` module under `nifi-standard-services`. The standard implementation uses the Bouncy Castle library and `PEMParser` class to handle decoding and decrypting Private Keys. The initial implementation supports [PEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail) encoding and [PKCS 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_8), which can be used for several standard key algorithms including RSA and DSA.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

The current test may lead to inconsistent ordering of `fragment.index` and thus fail the test. To fix the test, I changed the way of checking the ordering by counting the number of distinct indexes in the flow files.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to

flakiness that occurred in test file\r\n`nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.TestWaitNotifyProtocol`\r\nwith below three tests\r\n```\r\ntestNotifyAttributes\r\ntestNotifyCounters\r\ntestNotifyFirst\r\n```\r\nThe test flakiness is due to comparisons between Json Strings and outputs from\r\n`cacheEntry.getValue()` which is an Object `AtomicCacheEntry<String, String, Long>`\r\n\r\nHowever, JsonObject does not guarantee entry orders, its object is an unordered set of name/value pairs, and internal permutations may occur in the output as JSON String.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nSince JSON library `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind` is used in the current project, I import the `ObjectMapper`and use `mapper.readTree(JSON String)` when comparing them, thus the equals() method ignores the order and treats them as equal.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis test avoids nested or different orders of JSON strings that cause flaky errors.\r\nSince I didn't touch any Source code, it should be no impact on the project.\r\nAnd it passed the local test that the guidelines mentioned.\r\n\r\n#

Those two tests are flaky since they didn't do the sanity check where no flowfiles/rows should be transferred and would occasionally fail. To fix the test, I added the sanity check before asserting the `maxvalue.id`. I also changed the parameter `QueryDatabaseTable.MAX_ROWS_PER_FLOW_FILE` to 3 to make the tests clearer and more consistent.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10567](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10567) Corrects the parsing of Sensitive Dynamic Properties read from the XML version of the flow configuration, in absence of the JSON version.\r\n\r\nThe issue surfaces when upgrading to NiFi 1.17.0 or 1.18.0 from a version older than 1.16.0. The issue also requires the presence of a Parameter Context with a Sensitive value assigned to a component with a Sensitive Property. Upgrading from 1.16.0 and following is not a problem. Deleting the `flow.json.gz` configuration also triggers the problematic behavior.\r\n\r\nThe following steps can be used to reproduce the problem on NiFi 1.18.0:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Process Group\r\n2. Create and assign a new Parameter Context\r\n3. Create a Sensitive Parameter Value in the Parameter Context\r\n4. Create a Processor with a Sensitive Property\r\n5. Assign the Sensitive Parameter Value to the Processor Sensitive Property\r\n6. Stop NiFi\r\n7. Delete `flow.json.gz`\r\n8. Start NiFi\r\n\r\nAfter those steps, the Processor will be marked as invalid with an error indicating that Sensitive Dynamic Properties are configured but not supported.\r\n\r\nThe changes correct the behavior of the XML synchronizer to filter Sensitive Property Names based on the dynamic status indicated when calling `getPropertyDescriptor()` on the associated component. Additional changes include the removal of an unused method from `ControllerServiceLoader` and non-applicable exceptions from several related methods.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

I dived deep to the class \"ValidateLocale\" where the validator has been determined valid or not.\r\nAfter several printouts and checking log files, we found that the available locales is a deterministic list. \r\n\r\n```\r\nfinal Locale[] availableLocales = Locale.getAvailableLocales();\r\n```\r\nHowever, the if condition in this class looks like this:\r\n```\r\nif (availableLocales[0].equals(testLocale)) {\r\n                // Locale matches the \"null\" locale so it is treated as invalid\r\n                return new ValidationResult.Builder().subject(subject).input(input).valid(false)\r\n                        .explanation(input + \" is not a valid locale format.\").build();\r\n            }\r\n```\r\nThe purpose of this if statement is to determine if the testLocale is empty. However, as I said before, the availableLocales is a given list and the first element is not the zero. So I changed the code to this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (\"\".equals(testLocale.toString())) {\r\n                // Locale matches the \"null\" locale so it is treated as invalid\r\n                return new ValidationResult.Builder().subject(subject).input(input).valid(false)\r\n                        .explanation(input + \" is not a valid locale format.\").build();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n```\r\nBy changing this, the if statement can correctly work and the bug has been fixed. It is not flaky anymore and can pass the NonDex's check.\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X]

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10625](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10625) Adds optional support for HTTP/2 in NiFi Registry.\r\n\r\nThe implementation builds on the shared `nifi-jetty-configuration` capabilities, which already support HTTP/2. Additional changes include the introduction of a `nifi-security-ssl` for building an `SSLContext`, without the dependencies currently associated with `nifi-security-utils`.\r\n\r\nThe configuration includes a new property named `nifi.registry.web.https.application.protocols`, which defaults to `http/1.1` and supports enabling HTTP/2 by specifying `h2 http/1.1` for protocol negotiation.\r\n\r\n#

Therefore, checksums calculated based on the stream were also non-deterministic and thus failed when using NonDex to test.\r\n\r\nAfter changing the order to deterministic by first sorting keys, and adjusting the values of checksums in test cases, these tests are no longer flaky.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

So I changed the checksum in the test case to this value.\r\n\r\nFinally, this test is not flaky and can pass NonDex's check.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps
