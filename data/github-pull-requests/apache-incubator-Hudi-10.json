Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses ongoing issue with glue and athena/redshift-spectrum query engines: \r\ncurrently in some schema evolution scenario (see below), the modified columns can't be read. \r\nIt does not affect spark. partially fixes #11599\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on #9071 with some changes:\r\n- rebase on master\r\n- make use of existing update partition method\r\n- cascade when needed\r\n\r\nFew facts about cascading schema on partitions:\r\n- if a new column is added to the table -> NO NEED\r\n- if a column is dropped -> NO NEED\r\n- if a struct gets a new field as the last one -> NO NEED\r\n- if a struct get a new field between existing fields -> NEEDED\r\n- if a column is type promoted -> NEEDED\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIn case the table will have schema difference matching the rules above, the glue sync will take the time to update every partitions within glue.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-22T19:51:05Z","updated_at":"2024-07-30T01:52:35Z","closed_at":"2024-07-30T01:52:13Z","merged_at":"2024-07-30T01:52:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"2024d17704e6856174fc6b56ba51cd2d1b93b49d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6615585053,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABilHRHQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:S","name":"size:S","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":"PR

To be specific:\r\n\r\n- It requiresTable name as indicated by \"hoodie.table.name\".\r\n- It requiresTable base path \"hoodie.base.path\".\r\n- The partition key ([hoodie.write.lock.dynamodb.partition_key](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/configurations/#hoodiewritelockdynamodbpartition_key)) is automatically derived as `<table name>-<hash of the table base path>`. To check the exact content of the lock provider, please check relevant log from class DynamoDBBasedImplicitPartitionKeyLockProvider.\r\n\r\nIt is defined in src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/aws/transaction/lock/DynamoDBBasedImplicitPartitionKeyLockProvider.java.\r\n\r\nDynamoDBBasedLockProvider: The partition key is explicitly specified in [hoodie.write.lock.dynamodb.partition_key](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/configurations/#hoodiewritelockdynamodbpartition_key) of the lock configuration.\r\nDynamoDBBasedImplicitPartitionKeyLockProvider: It is implicitly derived from the hudi table base path and hudi table name. The 2 attributes are available in todays lockConfig, which contains all props from hudiWriterConfig.\r\n\r\nTest:\r\nUnit test and integration test\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdd new lock provider implementation. For code shared by the new-old lock provider, they are extracted to a base class.\r\nUnit test + integration test\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nno risk as of now since no one is using the new lock provider.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nIn https://hudi.apache.org/docs/concurrency_control/, we need to add description for the newly added lock provider.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-22T17:40:42Z","updated_at":"2024-07-25T15:43:50Z","closed_at":"2024-07-25T15:43:50Z","merged_at":"2024-07-25T15:43:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"7232d2461f4295c80001df73da2ddc150f84c8cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6607932904,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABid0N6A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:L","name":"size:L","color":"D15409","default":false,"description":"PR

mistakes:   \r\n- filtering condition was wrong during evaluation of dataSchema;  \r\n- options did not contain precombineField.  \r\n\r\nWith this PR I fixed it.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nprecombineField and partition field may be the same, and it works with local spark and on cluster.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\noverwrite payload for hive is not implemented, so an exception will be thrown if that is the chosen record merger strategy\r\n\r\nThis pr ended up expanding scope a lot. Here are the other changes:\r\n\r\n- Implement TestHoodieFileGroupReaderOnHive, the hive implementation of TestHoodieFileGroupReaderBase\r\n- Rename record mergers for spark to have naming that makes more sense and be consistent with hive \r\n    - OverwriteWithLatestSparkMerger -> OverwriteWithLatestSparkRecordMerger\r\n    -  HoodieSparkRecordMerger is now an abstract class that all spark mergers extend from, and all the implementation was moved to DefaultSparkRecordMerger\r\n    -  Same thing with hive. Now HoodieHiveRecordMerger is an abstract base class and DefaultHiveRecordMerger has the implementation\r\n- Refactor of HiveHoodieReaderContext to not take in FileSlice specific info \r\n    - reader context can have some state, but when it is initialized, it shouldn't be specific to any filegroup\r\n- Get rid of cache for table -> objectinspector. Maybe this hurts performance or maybe negligible, but is better for ensuring correctness \r\n- in HoodieRealtimeRecordReaderUtils, enum now converts to a `BytesWritable` (hadoop class for byte array) instead of `Text` (hadoop class for string). \r\n    - Parquet stores enums as byte arrays. During testing I found that for the non-FGReader implementation: For a fg that only had a base file and no log files, the enum would be read as BytesWritable, but for a read of a fg with base and log files it would be read as Text. This is because for merging we do the merging in avro and then convert to array writable (in the fg reader we merge using the engine native representation). It seems like hadoop/hive considers enums to be strings but since we haven't had any issues with byte array, I think it is better to unify everything as byte array.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- Implement additional record merger for hive\r\n- Better code quality for fg reader on hive\r\n- less risk of correctness issues for hive fg reader\r\n- Better and consistent naming for record mergers\r\n- More testing for fg reader on hive\r\n- Consistent type for enums\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\nadded extra testing for hive record reader\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-18T15:56:55Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T15:54:40Z","closed_at":"2024-09-11T02:05:22Z","merged_at":"2024-09-11T02:05:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"276133b814ef97aa427260fd2d0feb70723ae1b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6615577906,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABilG1Mg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:XL","name":"size:XL","color":"C50833","default":false,"description":"PR

issue with Spark 3.5.1 arises because the InsertIntoHoodieTableCommand chain calls the initialization of the HoodieFileIndex class. For v1 tables, the path is stored in CatalogTable#CatalogStorageFormat#storageProperties, but not in CatalogTable#properties. \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/660d3c1a-745f-456c-ae52-ca6dc75c1467)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Spark reloads the table, it removes the path key from CatalogTable#CatalogStorageFormat#storageProperties. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50d2268c-a1d2-422c-882a-c101e5c4c9ea)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a5c4543-6094-4110-8714-61c898a00051)\r\n\r\nConsequently, InsertIntoHoodieTableCommand in Hudi cannot retrieve the path from either CatalogTable#CatalogStorageFormat#storageProperties or CatalogTable#properties during deduceOverwriteConfig. This absence of the path key in combinedOpts leads to an error when initializing

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis jira aims to store partition type as well in `hoodie.table.partition.fields`. Currently this config stores the commas separated partition fields without the partition type. \r\nPartition type here corresponds to the partition type supported in Custom key generators like `simple` and `timestamp`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nTable config `hoodie.table.partition.fields` would now store the corresponding partition type with the field. Partition type is usually used with custom key generators to specify the partition type as `simple` or `timestamp`.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nSecondary index update fails because the current logic created a wasteful `secondary_index_` partition in addition to the actual index partition at the time of initialization, and was unable to detect the index partition correctly. This PR fixes the problem:\r\n- Removes unnecessary `secondary_index_` partition\r\n- Fixes the MDT writer methods to work with exact MDT partition name instead of `MetadataPartitionType`.\r\n- Added a test to udpate secondary keys\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nfix index update\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nI noticed that although the variable for path to `auxlib` is defined, it is not being used correctly. So running the CLI from repo-root kept redownloading the `jakarta` jars. The expected `auxlib` points to `<repo_root>/packaging/hudi-cli-bundle/auxlib` as defined in the `$HUDI_AUX_LIB` variable. However, the `wget` kept downloading to `$PWD/auxlib` which is incorrect.\r\n\r\nAlso, using Hudi CLI to access tables on S3 has some limitations as the relevant `hadoop` jars are not defined in the path by default. I have updated the CLI utility to facilitate adding the hadoop s3 jars as well. For compatibility purpose, I have made this facility behind a flag called `IS_S3_ENABLED` which can be set to `true`. Enabling this flag, will add the hadoop jars to the `auxlib` as well.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation

PySpark.\r\nNow we got NullPointerException described in https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/11616 due to not properly broadcasted `HadoopStorageConfiguration`.\r\nThis MR brings back previous behavior by broadcasting of `org.apache.spark.util.SerializableConfiguration`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nBrings back the same behavior as 0.15.0 release without mandatory setting of

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis MR fixes `ClassCastException` while reading by Spark, when `TimestampBasedKeyGenerator` is used.\r\nPrevious fix https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/11501 has been reverted by https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/11586.\r\nIn the previous fix nulls have been passed instead of parsing partition paths.\r\nAnyway, we shouldn't parse partition paths, but in this fix partition paths are passed as it is. `UTF8String`s are passed instead of nulls as I mentioned in the discussion under https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/11501.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes `ClassCastException`. Save previous behavior for unaffected cases.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow. Affects only if `TimestampBasedKeyGenerator` of `SCALAR`, `UNIX_TIMESTAMP` or `EPOCHMILLISECONDS` types is used. There is added `TestSparkSqlWithTimestampKeyGenerator`.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNo need.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-11T09:01:49Z","updated_at":"2024-11-03T14:53:42Z","closed_at":"2024-07-12T09:30:31Z","merged_at":"2024-07-12T09:30:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"e2860cddf5494578c64b0c3eeb2dc0160154ceda","assignee":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6605747796,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABibu2VA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:M","name":"size:M","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":"PR

the row writer defaults to snapshot reads for all tables. However, this method is relatively inefficient for MOR  tables when there are no logs. Additionally, we have already configured the glob path for queries. We need to read all the files from the glob path without requiring additional configurations for time travel queries. I believe the parameter \r\n TIMESTAMP_AS_OF is unnecessary and may lead to inconsistencies between the instant and the selected files, potentially causing data loss. Therefore, we should optimize this part of the configuration.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn the bugfix for [HUDI-7955](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-7955), the wrong class for invoking {{getTimestamp }}was used.\r\n\r\n1. **Wrong**: org.apache.hadoop.hive.common.type.Timestamp\r\n2. **Correct**: org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.io.TimestampWritableV2\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/6312314/3d1bca3a-2ad4-4e25-b421-daec91d7c65c)\r\n\r\nSubmitting a bugfix to fix this bugfix... \r\n\r\nLog levels for the exception block is also changed to warn so errors will be printed out.\r\nHowever, false positives might be printed when the environment is indeed in Hive2.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, we have simplified the `getMillis` shim to remove the method that was added in [HUDI-7955](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-7955) to standardise it with how `getDays` is written.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdjusting defaults with spillable map memory. Looks like we were allocating 80% of memory to pending compactions, giving only 15Mb to file groups. Also found some gaps around memory computation which was missed when new actions were added. \r\n\r\nAfter the fix, here is what the default looks like\r\ntotal memory for spillable: 100Mb\r\npending compaction: 10Mb\r\npending clustering: 2Mb\r\npending log compaction: 2Mb\r\ncompleted replace commits: 5Mb\r\nbootstrap files: 5M \r\nactual file groups: 76Mb. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMore memory for file groups in FSVs when spillable map is enabled. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIf we specify partition fields in an order different from the order in create table schema, then query does not fail and the whole partitioning is incorrect.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis is a part of RFC-60: Object Storage Storage Strategy https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/rfc/rfc-60/rfc-60.md. The end goal is to leverage the HoodieStorage layer to further separate Hudi logic from File IO, allowing more flexibility in the physical location of files.\r\n\r\nThis PR will add StorageStrategy to HoodieStorage, but StorageStrategy will NOT be used anywhere just yet.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

This change provides a way to create empty clean commits at a cadence. This is quite useful for insert only datasets which might receive updates/rewrite rarely. It helps in copying the earliestCommitToRetain value so that full scan of the dataset can be avoided.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\n_Describe context and summary for this change. Highlight if any code was copied._\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

not necessaily be true. This PR handles NPE by simply logging a warning if props are not present.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen multiple writers trigger table services, there is a chance that one of them could create requested in a different ordering compared to the actual timestamp. Linked jira has more details of the scenario w/ an illustration. This patch, ensure that before creating a requested entry in the timeline, there is no other instant greater than the current instant time.\r\n\r\nMajor reason is, a writer could generate a new commit time in memory (say t10), and then take a long time to do some computation and eventually add the requested instant to timeline very late (say t100). In b/w these two time, there could be another concurrent writer choosing t25 as commit time and proceed. This might lead to unexpected behaviors as called out in the jira. \r\n\r\nThis patch is for 0.x branch. \r\nhere is the equivalent 1.x branch PR https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/11344 which guarantees monotonically increasing timestamp. But 0.x branch fix is simpler and not looking to mimic exact 1.0 fix. \r\n\r\nFor 0.x, we are adding a config for this and not enabling by default and interested users can enable it. It makes sense for multi-writer use-cases to enable it. \r\n\"hoodie.timestamp.ordering.validate.enable\" is the config of interest. \r\n\r\nNote on Locking : \r\nThis patch is introducing an additional step to validate the the instant time used to generate the plan is the highest and there is no other instant time in the timeline whose time > current instant time of interest. \r\nIdeally, we might need to take table lock before doing this timestamp validation. But it expands the scope of the patch to take locks for every operation. With this patch, we are locking while generating instants for ingestion writes, compaction and clustering. For cleaning and rollbacks, we plan to take it up later. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nCovered in previous section\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nRemoving the case `INT` + **DATE** if - block as **DATE** types from the Hive related entrypoints will have a **DATE** `PrmitiveFieldObjectInspector` type.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/6312314/9f5dd080-a65d-4b3e-b910-5110118aeb58)\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, this logic is mainly copied over from:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/70f44efe298771fcef9d029820a9b431e1ff165c/hudi-hadoop-mr/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/hadoop/utils/HoodieRealtimeRecordReaderUtils.java#L178-L181\r\n\r\nOf which, was introduced in this PR here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2634/files\r\n\r\nThe `switch-case` for this is applied on a different entrypoint (switching an Avro Schema type). For such cases, **DATE** types will most definitely enter the `CASE-INT` block. \r\n\r\nHowever, in `HiveAvroSerializer`,  the code is switching by `PrimitiveObjectInspector.PrimitiveCategory` instead. When reading **DATE** types, the `CASE-DATE` will be used instead of `CASE-INT`, making the block that we are deleting here a piece of code that will never be used.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, the entire `CASE-INT` block can be removed as it is already handled by the `default` block\r\n\r\nTherefore, removing it to avoid further confusion.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Remove case-blocks as we are switching by different types and entrypoints are different\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [X] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen there are no log files in index, then the lookup returns no secondary keys or candidate files, because of a bug - `logRecordsMap` is empty in this code and base file records are ignored - https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/70f44efe298771fcef9d029820a9b431e1ff165c/hudi-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/metadata/HoodieBackedTableMetadata.java#L970\r\n\r\nEven though current tests for pruning asserts the filtered files count < total data files count. It is weak in the sense that it does not filtered files count > 0, and hence the assertion passed even when filtered files count = 0. This PR fixes the code and the test. The test without the change in `HoodieBackedTableMetadata` will fail. With the change, we also see number of files getting scanned is lesser (without the change, number of files read is more than 1):\r\n<img width=\"467\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-05 at 3 39 52 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/16440354/47898914-daaf-4f3f-9da6-05dadbbda31b\">\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nData skipping with secondary index\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change.
