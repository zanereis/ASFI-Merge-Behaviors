Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

A JNA based [oshi](https://github.com/oshi/oshi) library was proposed by @abhishekagarwal87  in slack community which is well maintained, used by projects like Apache flink, and also works well on ARM architecture too. Here I introduce v0 of `SysMonitorOshi`, oshi based SysMonitor for Druid. \r\nThis monitor monitors most of the metrics emitted by `SysMonitor.java` but is a v0 implementation which just consumes metrics emitted by Oshi directly, without modifying/mapping it.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nAdded a new monitor `SysMonitorOshi` to replace `SysMonitor`. The new monitor has a wider support for different machine architectures including ARM instances. Please switch to SysMonitorOshi as `SysMonitor` is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SysMonitorOshi.java`\r\n * `NoopSysMonitorOshi.java`\r\n * `SysMonitorOshiTest.java`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen calling the Sampler API `POST /druid/indexer/v1/sampler`, the sampler creates an input source to sample records from. When the input source has to be created (i.e. a parser hasn't been provided, usually Kafka or Kinesis), we create one by instantiating a new `RecordSupplierInputSource`.\r\n\r\nThe constructor of `RecordSupplierInputSource` seeks the beginning (or end) of the Kafka partitions / Kinesis shards. While doing so, things can go wrong - Network issues, authentication problems, etc. Any exceptions that occur are wrapped with a `StreamException` (done via the `wrapExceptions` helper function).\r\n\r\nThe Sampler, however, deals with `SamplerException`s only. To that end, a `SamplerExceptionMapper` has been registered which maps such exceptions to a `400 Bad Request` response.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned `RecordSupplierInputSource` already catches a `InterruptedException` and maps it to a `SamplerException`, but ignores any `StreamException`. This causes the sampler API to return a `500 Internal server error` (with the message \"The RuntimeException could not be mapped to a response, re-throwing to the HTTP container\").\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this issue by handling `StreamException`s accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\nWe could also catch any exception (instead of exceptions of a specific type).\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nHandle exceptions while sampling from streaming sources. We could also omit this since the Sampler API isn't currently documented (#14125).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nI think we should consider switching the `IndexSpec` default value of `stringDictionaryEncoding` to `{\"type\":\"frontCoded\", \"bucketSize\":4, \"formatVersion\":1}`.\r\n\r\nBased on measurements #13854 things look pretty good and we have been running version 0 of the format for some time on a number of datasources without any notable performance loss, and version 1 for a smaller amount of time. I think by the time 27 is released it should be sufficiently baked in to feel confident about it being the default.\r\n\r\nHowever, this means that upgrading from versions older than 26 will need special consideration, so it is important to call out in the release notes if we go forward with this.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFront coding was originally introduced in Druid 25.0, and an improved 'version 1' was introduced in Druid 26.0, with typically faster read speed and smaller storage size, has become the default in Druid 27.0. This means by default, segments created with Druid 27.0 are backwards compatible with Druid 26.0, but not compatible with Druid versions older than 26.0. If upgrading to Druid 27.0 from a version older than 26.0, the `stringDictionaryEncoding` should be set to `{\"type\": \"utf8\"}` to keep writing out the older format to enable seamless downgrades to Druid 25.0 and older, and then later is recommended to be changed to the new default once determined that rollback is not necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been

is to update the datasketches-java dependency to the latest 4.0.0 release with some API changes, and also to datasketches-memory-2.2.0\r\n\r\nSome expectations in the unit tests were changed because in this version of datasketches-java all quantile sketches have \"inclusive\" mode by default. It is possible, if necessary, to use sketches in the \"exclusive\" mode explicitly to get the same functionality as before, but in my view it is not necessary, and most users won't notice any difference. It might happen to be important for someone in some special circumstances, but I doubt that. Perhaps even better would be to introduce a parameter, so that the mode could be chosen by the user, but that is a lot more work.\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-23T21:07:43Z","updated_at":"2023-10-23T06:36:53Z","closed_at":"2023-05-28T05:19:19Z","merged_at":"2023-05-28T05:19:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"4131c0df133a425ea74b121cecc6c24de66784de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

It adds a new input source of type `iceberg` that connects to a catalog and retrieves the data files associated with an iceberg table and provides these data file paths to either an S3 or HDFS input source depending on the warehouse location.\r\n\r\nTwo important dependencies associated with Apache Iceberg tables are:\r\n- Catalog : This extension supports reading from either a Hive Metastore catalog or a Local file-based catalog. Support for AWS Glue is not available yet.\r\n- Warehouse : This extension supports reading data files from either HDFS or S3. Adapters for other cloud object locations should be easy to add by extending the `AbstractInputSourceAdapter`.\r\n\r\nSample ingestion spec:\r\n\r\n ```\r\n     \"inputSource\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"iceberg\",\r\n        \"tableName\": \"logs\",\r\n        \"namespace\": \"webapp\",\r\n        \"icebergFilter\": {\r\n                    \"type\": \"interval\",\r\n                    \"filterColumn\": \"createTime\",\r\n                    \"intervals\": [\r\n                        \"2023-05-10T00:00:00.000Z/2023-05-15T00:00:00.000Z\"\r\n                    ]\r\n                },\r\n        \"icebergCatalog\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"hive\",\r\n          \"warehousePath\": \"hdfs://localwarehouse/\",\r\n          \"catalogUri\": \"thrift://hdfscatalog:9083\",\r\n          \"catalogProperties\": {\r\n            \"hive.metastore.connect.retries\": \"1\",\r\n            \"hive.metastore.execute.setugi\": \"false\",\r\n            \"hive.metastore.kerberos.principal\": \"principal@krb.com\",\r\n            \"hive.metastore.sasl.enabled\": \"true\",\r\n            \"hadoop.security.authentication\": \"kerberos\",\r\n            \"hadoop.security.authorization\": \"true\",\r\n            \"java.security.auth.login.config\": \"jaas.config\",\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"warehouseSource\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"hdfs\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"inputFormat\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"parquet\"\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\nEnhanced ingestion capabilities to support ingestion of Apache Iceberg data.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `IcebergCatalog.java`\r\n * `IcebergInputSource.java`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

`EXPLAIN PLAN` output includes a `RESOURCES` column that contains a collection of resources used in the query as a string. Previously the resources would be an unordered collection, where the ordering wasn't deterministic. This change makes them ordered (by name), thereby deterministic by changing `Set` to a `List` and adding a `sorted` operation to the stream operations. Also, this change:\r\n\r\n- Replaces deprecated `ObjectNode#put()` calls with `ObjectNode#set()`\r\n- Adds a new unit test to demonstrate the non-deterministic ordering observed prior to this change\r\n- Cleans up some unit tests\r\n- Fixes the EXPLAIN PLAN docs\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

after an MSQ query, the web console is responsible for waiting for the segments to load.

Description\r\nThis PR adds a new interface to control how `SegmentMetadataCache` chooses `ColumnType` when faced with differences between segments for SQL schemas which are computed, exposed as `druid.sql.planner.metadataColumnTypeMergePolicy` and adds a new 'least restrictive type' mode to allow choosing the type that data across all segments can best be coerced into and sets this as the default behavior.\r\n\r\nThis is a behavior change around when segment driven schema migrations take effect for the SQL schema. With `latestInterval`, the SQL schema will be updated as soon as the first job with the new schema has published segments, while using `leastRestrictive`, the schema will only be updated once all segments are reindexed to the new type. The benefit of `leastRestrictive` is that it eliminates a bunch of type coercion errors that can happen in SQL when types are varied across segments with `latestInterval` because the newest type is not able to correctly represent older data, such as if the segments have a mix of ARRAY and number types, or any other combinations that lead to odd query plans.\r\n\r\nI am not at all attached to these names, so if they should be called something else more intuitive then feel free to suggest.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nA new broker configuration, `druid.sql.planner.metadataColumnTypeMergePolicy` adds configurable modes to how column types are computed for the SQL table schema when faced with differences between segments. A new `leastRestrictive` mode allows choosing the most appropriate type that data across all segments can best be coerced into, and is now the default behavior. This is a subtle behavior change around when segment driven schema migrations will take effect for the SQL schema. With `latestInterval`, the SQL schema will be updated as soon as the first job with the new schema has published segments in the latest time interval of the data, while using the new `leastRestrictive` mode, the schema will only be updated once all segments are reindexed to the new type. However, `leastRestrictive` is likely to have \"better\" query time behavior and eliminates some query time errors and other oddities that can occur when using `latestInterval`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

and Theta sketch estimates have been used only as PostAggs as they work on groupBy and TopN queries. But postAggs are not supported for scan queries. Window functions require these sketches estimates to work over a window engulfed by a scan query which requires these postAggs to be used as an expression. In this PR we introduce `HLL_SKETCH_ESTIMATE` and `THETA_SKETCH_ESTIMATE` as expressions. These estimates work on a sketch column and has the same behavior as the postAggs.

is an undocumented parameter that controls how cluster-by statistics are merged. In PARALLEL mode, statistics are gathered from workers all at once. In SEQUENTIAL mode, statistics are gathered time chunk by time chunk. This improves accuracy for jobs with many time chunks, and reduces memory usage.\r\n\r\nThe main downside of SEQUENTIAL is that it can take longer, but in most situations I've seen, PARALLEL is only really usable in cases where the sketches are small enough that SEQUENTIAL would also run relatively quickly.

Description\r\n\r\nThis change allows for consideration of the input format and compression  when computing how to split the input files among available tasks, in MSQ ingestion, when considering the value of the  `maxInputBytesPerWorker` query context parameter. This query parameter allows users to control the maximum number of bytes, with granularity of input file / object, that ingestion tasks will be assigned to ingest. With this change, this context parameter now denotes the estimated weighted size in bytes of the input to split on, with consideration for input format and compression format, rather than the actual file size, reported by the file system.  We assume uncompressed newline delimited json as a baseline, with scaling factor of `1`. This means that when computing the byte weight that a file has towards the input splitting, we take the file size as is, if uncompressed json, 1:1. It was found during testing that gzip compressed json, and parquet, has scale factors of `4` and `8` respectively, meaning that each byte of data is weighted 4x and 8x respectively, when computing input splits. This weighted byte scaling is only considered for MSQ ingestion that uses either LocalInputSource or CloudObjectInputSource at the moment. The default value of the `maxInputBytesPerWorker` query context parameter has been updated from 10 GiB, to 512 MiB\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFixes a couple of bugs with the 'auto' column schema, the first relating to incorrectly treating arrays with all null elements as all null columns, instead of ARRAY<STRING> columns with all null elements (we typically handle all null columns as STRING typed unless explicitly typed, which auto columns are not). Also fixes an issue with boolean typed arrays not correctly being handled in 'best effort' mode and honoring 'strict' mode.\r\n\r\nAdded test data covers both of these issues.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

Description\r\nFixes `SegmentAnalyzer` to be more resilient and prefer to use 'error' flag and messages on `ColumnAnalysis` rather than exploding, which protects the downstream broker SQL metadata cache from getting stuck if any segments run into bugs or other unexpected errors during column analysis.\r\n\r\nThis was uncovered by a bug in 'auto' column schema which was incorrectly calling an 'all null' `DictionaryEncodedColumn` a `COMPLEX` type resulting in a class cast exception while doing complex analysis since it did not implement `ComplexColumn`. However, there were a handful of other places which might have thrown exceptions while processing columns, so I've updated things to more aggressively handle any errors that might be thrown and turn them into ColumnAnalysis with the 'error' state set.\r\n\r\nI made a builder for `ColumnAnalysis` while I was here to clean up a few things, and also made these internal segment metadata queries no longer utilize the broker parallel merge pool, both to reserve capacity for actual user queries, and also because we aren't actually merging these segment metadata results, so it is rather pointless to use anyway.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThe `TaskQueue` in the Overlord implements concurrency control using a `giant` lock. A similar technique has been used in other classes such as `TaskMaster` and `TaskLockbox`. While this `giant` lock does guarantee thread-safe access of critical sections of code, it can be too restrictive at times and can even lead to the Overlord being completely stuck.\r\n\r\nA typical scenario is described below.\r\n- Insertion of a sub-task of an `index_parallel` task fails with a `SQLTransientException` (say, due to an oversized payload)\r\n- The `index_parallel` repeatedly requests the Overlord to insert this sub-task\r\n- Each time, the Overlord tries to insert this task up to 10 times (using `RetryUtils`)\r\n- While the Overlord is trying to insert, the calling thread holds the `TaskQueue.giant` lock\r\n- This causes the Overlord to essentially hang as no other `TaskQueue` operation can proceed without the lock. This includes operations like adding a new task, killing a task, submitting tasks to runner for execution, syncing from metadata, etc.\r\n\r\nNote: The indefinite retry issue in the above scenario is also being addressed separately in #14271 \r\n\r\n### Current implementation\r\n\r\nThe `giant` lock is a reentrant lock, which is effectively the same as the object monitor associated with any java object. In principle, this lock could be replaced by simply making all the methods of `TaskQueue` `synchronized`.\r\n\r\nThere are several fields which can be protected with more lenient locking to improve performance.\r\n\r\n### Proposed implementation\r\n\r\nThe operations/fields currently protected by the `giant` lock are discussed below.\r\n\r\n#### (a) Methods: `start()`, `stop()`, `syncFromStorage()`, `manage()`\r\nChange: Make methods `synchronized` \r\nRationale: This effectively remains the same as the current implementation\r\n\r\n#### (b) Field `LinkedHashMap<String, Task> tasks`: `putIfAbsent()`, `get()`, `values()`, `remove()`\r\nChange: Use a `ConcurrentHashMap` instead in conjunction with a `BlockingDeque<String>`\r\nRationale:\r\n- The only concurrency control needed here is at a task level, which can be easily ensured by a `ConcurrentHashMap`.\r\n- The `BlockingDeque` is used to maintain the order in which task IDs were submitted to the `TaskQueue`.\r\n- The updates to these data structures are made atomically using `compute()` and `computeIfAbsent()`. \r\n\r\n#### (c) Field `HashMap<String, Future> taskFutures`: `put()`, `remove()`\r\nChange: Replace with a `Sets.newConcurrentHashSet()` instead\r\nRationale: This field is just used to track task ids already submitted to the task runner.\r\n\r\n#### (d) Field `taskStorage`: `insert()`\r\nChange: Move outside critical section\r\nRationale: `TaskStorage` implementations do not maintain any state and thus don't require any concurrency control\r\n\r\n#### (e) Field `taskLockbox`: `add()`, `remove()`\r\nChange: Move outside critical section\r\nRationale: `TaskLockbox` has its own `giant` lock and can thus be safely accessed here.\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n- \r\n\r\n### Pending items (WIP)\r\nUnit tests for\r\n- cleanup of dangling locks left over by tasks that couldn't acquire their locks on leader re-election\r\n- proper operation under different race conditions in TaskQueue\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nDo not emit negative lag because of stale offsets.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\nThe latest topic offsets are polled frequently and used to determine the lag based on the current offsets. However, when the offsets are stale (which can happen due to connection issues commonly), we may see a negative lag .\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nThis PR prevents emission of metrics when the offsets are stale and at least one of the partitions has a negative lag.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\nThis PR prevents emission of negative streaming ingestion lag when the fetched latest offsets are stale\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

issues with task log streaming + pushing logs when a task in cancelled\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI was trying to fix the bug where task logs are not pushed if a task is cancelled because the job is deleted before the main thread has a chance to grab logs, but when doing this I noticed that there is a issue with streaming logs.\r\n\r\nThe LogWatch fabric8 class doesn't really play well with the way we are streaming logs (it seems to keep its output stream that we return in the OverlordResource response open for as long as the logWatch controller is open, so when a request to stream logs to the K8sTaskRunner is ran, it just hangs since there are technically more lines in the stream as long as the LogWatcher is still open.\r\n\r\nThe LogWatcher only seems to get closed if .close is explicitly called or if the underlying k8s condition is satisfied (i think it waits for the container to be completed).\r\n\r\nThe regular getLogInputStream stream returned by fabric8 works well enough for streaming task logs (it just captures a stream of the k8s logs at the moment), since the druid console will periodically call the overlordResource to refresh the logs anyways. I've confirmed this in manual testing.\r\n\r\nit would probably be good if we actually used the offset parameter to the streamTaskLog in KubernetesTaskRunner instead of just returning the whole stream, I can look into that in a future PR.\r\n\r\nI also included the work to push logs from cancelled tasks in this PR. The log watcher fabric8 primitive is useful here since we can create a watcher on the terminating container to grab all the logs available up until it dies.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- FIx bugs around K8s Task scheduling log streaming and logging for cancelled tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\nChanges are only to the kubernetes-overlord-extensions module.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Details\r\nAdding the new SegmentMetadataEvent and publishing these segment-related metadata events into Kafka by enhancing the KafkaEmitter\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nIn this PR, we are enhancing KafkaEmitter, to emit metadata about published segments (SegmentMetadataEvent) into a Kafka topic. This segment metadata information that gets published into Kafka, can be used by any other downstream services to query Druid intelligently based on the segments published. The segment metadata gets published into kafka topic in json string format similar to other events.\r\n\r\n## Old behavior of Kafka Emitter\r\nKafka Emitter always emits metrics and alerts and would emit requests if the config request.topic is configured.\r\nConfigs metric.topic and alert.topic are always mandatory and cannot be null.\r\n\r\n## Current behavior of Kafka Emitter [with backwards compatibility]\r\nWe introduced a new config named event.types which dictates the types of events we want the KafkaEmitter to emit. This config takes in a list of strings and can have one or more from [alerts, metrics, requests and segmentMetadata]. And based on this config, alert.topic, request.topic, metric.topic and segmentMetadata.topic should be configured and not left empty.\r\nIf no event.types is set, then by default, the kafka emitter would emit metrics and alerts. And in that case, to maintain backwards compatibility, decision to send out requests are based on if request.topic is empty or set.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-15T17:54:49Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T10:33:34Z","closed_at":"2023-06-02T15:58:27Z","merged_at":"2023-06-02T15:58:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"4ff6026d30e4da53dc0e37bc2279d9e030773787","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

The `taskDuration` of index_kafka ingestion task is about PT1H, so if failed in `push` stage, data will be re-consumed, it will cause big data delay in realtime scenario.\r\n1) During the peon task initialization, there was error:\r\n`\r\nWARN [main] org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DFSUtilClient - Namenode for nameservice-XXX remains unresolved for ID namenodeXXX. Check your hdfs-site.xml file to ensure namenodes are configured properly.\r\n`\r\n2) During the `push` stage, there was NameNode failover for 15 times. Finally peon task was failed.\r\n\r\n\r\nExcept for the DNS issue in my company, I think we need to make improvement in Druid: we need to validate the FileSystem object completely if `fs.hdfs.impl.disable.cache` is `false`. If FileSystem is invalid, we should stop the task immediately, not let it go and then finally become failed during the `push` stage.  \r\nSource code locates in: `HdfsStorageDruidModule::configure`\r\n```\r\n    final Configuration conf = new Configuration();\r\n\r\n    conf.setClassLoader(getClass().getClassLoader());\r\n\r\n    ClassLoader currCtxCl = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();\r\n    try {\r\n      Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(getClass().getClassLoader());\r\n      FileSystem.get(conf);  // Get a FileSystem object is not complete\r\n    }\r\n    catch (IOException ex) {\r\n      throw new RuntimeException(ex);\r\n    }\r\n    finally {\r\n      Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(currCtxCl);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

for details on the requirement of this change.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Add a `DruidException` which contains a user-facing error message, HTTP response code and a cause\r\n- `EntryExistsException` extends `DruidException` and is now an unchecked exception\r\n- Throw `DruidException` with response code 400 (bad request) if metadata store `max_allowed_packet` limit is violated. This is accomplished by adding `SQLMetadataConnector.isRootCausePacketTooBigException` which can be implemented by specific connectors (e.g. MySQL, Postgres, etc.)\r\n- A response code of 400 thrown above instead of 500 ensures that the request is not retried by the client.\r\n\r\nThis work is more of a temporary band-aid and it should later tie in to #14004 which is a much more formalized treatment of Druid errors in general.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nIf the packet size of a given statement exceeds the `max_allowed_packet`, an exception of the following form is encountered:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.skife.jdbi.v2.exceptions.CallbackFailedException:\r\n  org.skife.jdbi.v2.exceptions.UnableToExecuteStatementException:\r\n  java.sql.SQLTransientConnectionException:\r\n    (conn=10271) Could not send query: query size is >= to max_allowed_packet\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root cause here is a `SQLTransientConnectionException` which gets (correctly) categorized as a _transient_ exception by `SQLMetadataConnector.isTransientException()` and is thus retried.\r\n\r\nIn a typical situation where an `index_parallel` task or a Coordinator issued `compact` task tries to create sub-tasks with a very large payload, the following tends to happen:\r\n- Supervisor task requests the Overlord to insert the new sub-task in the DB\r\n- Insertion fails with violation of `max_allowed_packet`\r\n- Being a transient exception, the insertion is retried (typically upto 9 times with exponential backoff, taking something like 3 mins in total)\r\n- While the Overlord is busy retrying insertion in the DB, the supervisor gets a `ReadTimeoutException` response\r\n- `ServiceClientImpl` on the supervisor task side interprets this as an network/IO exception and retries it an unlimited number of times. (See `StandardRetryPolicy.unlimited()` below)\r\n-  Parent `index_parallel` or `compact` task makes no progress and doesn't fail either\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/9eebeead4472a44f31cdc2b9fd48919f89446ea2/indexing-service/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/indexing/common/task/batch/parallel/TaskMonitor.java#L109-L118\r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\nIn truth, the violation of `max_allowed_packet` is not really a transient exception as it doesn't go away until the DB admin increases the configured limit.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nAfter the changes, an `index_parallel` task with an oversized merge task payload fails as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.druid.rpc.HttpResponseException: Server error [400 Bad Request]; body: {\"error\":\"Payload for task [partial_index_generic_merge_wikipedia_acflahlo_2023-06-02T13:43:42.233Z] exceeds the packet limit.

This prevents an `index_parallel` task from retrying the insertion of a bad sub-task indefinitely and causes it to fail immediately.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Changes\r\n\r\nThe defaults of the following config values in the `CoordinatorDynamicConfig` are being updated.\r\n\r\n#### 1. `maxSegmentsInNodeLoadingQueue = 500` (previous = 100)\r\n\r\nRationale: With round-robin segment assignment now being the default assignment technique, the Coordinator can assign a large number of under-replicated/unavailable segments very quickly. Before round-robin, a large queue size would cause the Coordinato to get stuck in `RunRules` duty due to very slow strategy-based cost computations.\r\n\r\n#### 2. `replicationThrottleLimit = 500` (previous = 10)\r\nRationale: Along with the reasoning given for `maxSegmentsInNodeLoadingQueue`, a very low `replicationThrottleLimit` can cause clusters to be very slow in getting to full replication, even when there are loading threads sitting idle.\r\n\r\nNote: It is okay to keep this value equal to `maxSegmentsInNodeLoadingQueue`. Even with equal values, load queues will not get filled up with just replicas, and segments that are completely unavailable will still get a fair chance. This is because while MSINLQ applies to a single server, `replicationThrottleLimit` applies to each tier.\r\n\r\n#### 3. `maxSegmentsToMove = 100` (previous = 5)\r\n\r\nRationale: A very low value of this config (say 5) turns out to be very ineffective in balancing especially if there are a large number of segments in a cluster and/or a large skew between usages of two historical servers.\r\nOn the other hand, a very large value can cause excessive moves every minute, which might have the following disadvantages:\r\n- Load of moving segments competing with load of unavailable/under-replicated segments\r\n- Unnecessary network costs due to constant download and delete of segments\r\n\r\nThese defaults will be revisited after #13197 is merged.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThese values have been tried on different production cluster sizes, and have been found to give satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nUpdate default values of the following coordinator dynamic configs:\r\n- `maxSegmentsInNodeLoadingQueue = 500`\r\n- `maxSegmentsToMove = 100`\r\n- `replicationThrottleLimit = 500`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFixes an oversight whenever `storeEmptyColumns` is enabled on the task config when using 'auto' type columns which would result in a class cast exception when issuing segment metadata queries to build the SQL schema like:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.druid.segment.serde.NullColumnPartSerde$NullDictionaryEncodedColumn cannot be cast to org.apache.druid.segment.column.ComplexColumn\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was happening because the 'null' column serde relies on `ValueType` being set correctly in the column descriptor, which for totally empty auto columns were defaulting to `Complex<JSON>` which ends up with `ValueType.COMPLEX` which when coming back from reading a segment ends up with \"unknown\" complex, pushing it into the 'complex' analysis. I've changed the 'auto' indexer to treat empty columns logical type as 'STRING' so that the value type is set accordingly when writing out the 'null' column.\r\n\r\nAdded test coverage to ensure null auto type columns dont explode the SQL schema when this flag is set.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

No other types of locks may coexist with such intervals. This facilitates several appending jobs to run concurrently on the same interval.\r\n\r\nThis means that we can only replace or append to an interval, but not both, with timechunk locking.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nWe introduce two new lock types in this PR to lay the foundation for a replace job to run concurrently with multiple appending jobs for an interval. These locks are called REPLACE and APPEND and are meant to be used for replacing and appending jobs respectively, and may only be used with TIMECHUNK locking.\r\n`Please note that this PR doesn't enable the usage of these locks.`\r\n\r\n- An interval may have at most one REPLACE lock and any number of APPEND locks with intervals completely enclosed by that of the REPLACE lock's.\r\n- An interval may have any number of APPEND locks and each of these may be coexist with at most one REPLACE lock, whose interval completely encloses the APPEND lock's.\r\n\r\n### Algorithm\r\nWe now have 4 types of locks, with different compatibility criteria described above.\r\n- When a lock is requested, we first see if it can peacefully exist with other conflicting locks in which case we grant the lock immediately.\r\n- When the request is incompatible with one or more of the existing locks, we try to see if each of the incompatible locks can be revoked. If yes, we grant the requested lock after revoking all of them.\r\n- Otherwise, the request fails without affecting any of the existing locks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.
