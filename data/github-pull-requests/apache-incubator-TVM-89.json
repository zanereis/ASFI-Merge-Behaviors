Int64 was introduced because of the calculation between python int and np.int32, which results in np.int64.

PR is an attempt to support the [`TimeDistributed`](https://keras.io/api/layers/recurrent_layers/time_distributed/) layer in the Keras frontend. Because `TimeDistributed` takes a layer as an argument, I had to modify the existing conversion functions to take parameters instead of making assumptions about the Keras model or `etab` data structure. Perhaps it might be better not to attempt to reuse the existing conversion functions and special-case the different possible arguments to `TimeDistributed` -- I would be glad to take any suggestions on this.\r\n\r\nI would also be interested to know what you might advise as to further test cases for `TimeDistributed`; I went by the example from the documentation and another use-case I found that used `TimeDistributed` with `Dense`.\r\n\r\n@jroesch I am not entirely sure who would be the best person to review a change to the Keras frontend and would appreciate any

This op can handle more general layout transform than the existing `relay.op.transform.layout_transform`\r\n- Add a relay pass `AutoSchedulerLayoutRewrite` to do the layout rewrite.\r\n- Add a field

Winograd conv2d is very slow. This makes the feature extraction in auto-scheduler very slow.\r\nI found the reason is that simplifying the const matrix expressions in Winograd conv2d takes a lot of time. One example of these expressions is\r\n```\r\nA(i, j) = select(((floormod(i, 6) == 5) && (floormod(j, 4) == 3)), 1f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 5) && (floormod(j, 4) == 2)), 0f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 5) && (floormod(j, 4) == 1)), 0f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 5) && (floormod(j, 4) == 0)), 0f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 4) && (floormod(j, 4) == 3)), -8f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 4) && (floormod(j, 4) == 2)), 4f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 4) && (floormod(j, 4) == 1)), -2f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 4) && (floormod(j, 4) == 0)), 1f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 3) && (floormod(j, 4) == 3)), 0.125f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 3) && (floormod(j, 4) == 2)), 0.25f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 3) && (floormod(j, 4) == 1)), 0.5f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 3) && (floormod(j, 4) == 0)), 1f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 2) && (floormod(j, 4) == 3)), 1f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 2) && (floormod(j, 4) == 2)), 1f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 2) && (floormod(j, 4) == 1)), 1f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 2) && (floormod(j, 4) == 0)), 1f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 1) && (floormod(j, 4) == 3)), -1f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 1) && (floormod(j, 4) == 2)), 1f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 1) && (floormod(j, 4) == 1)), -1f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 1) && (floormod(j, 4) == 0)), 1f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 0) && (floormod(j, 4) == 3)), 0f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 0) && (floormod(j, 4) == 2)), 0f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 0) && (floormod(j, 4) == 1)), 0f, select(((floormod(i, 6) == 0) && (floormod(j, 4) == 0)), 1f, 0f))))))))))))))))))))))))\r\n```\r\nBut this part is actually useless for feature extraction. So I added a new flag to replace all accesses to constant matrices by constant value 1.\r\nThis flag produces a wrong IR but it is good enough for feature extraction purposes.\r\n\r\nThis accelerates one round of GA search from 300s to 150s on p3.2xlarge for a Winograd conv2d.\r\n\r\nOther fixes:\r\n- Fix an integer overflow in feature extraction\r\n- Use a smaller `min_repeat_ms=300` for CUDA\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-27T06:26:07Z","updated_at":"2020-11-28T12:06:46Z","closed_at":"2020-11-28T12:06:43Z","merged_at":"2020-11-28T12:06:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"9a9ec1aea30ff7292b7d3b3157d4e7064d729792","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6981/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6981/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6981/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/d5b0d4d85c605cd0ef34bc77c3a1726198ea99d3","head":{"label":"merrymercy:pr-acc-feature","ref":"pr-acc-feature","sha":"d5b0d4d85c605cd0ef34bc77c3a1726198ea99d3","user":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110390605,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTAzOTA2MDU=","name":"tvm","full_name":"merrymercy/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy/tvm","description":"End

PR implements the automated quantization framework described in the [RFC](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-search-based-automated-quantization/5483). More detail can be found in the [paper draft](https://www.ziheng.org/files/hago.pdf) also. We observe that HAGO achieves speedups of 2.09x, 1.97x, and 2.48x on Intel Xeon Cascade Lake CPUs, NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPUs, ARM Cortex-A CPUs on Raspberry Pi4 relative to full precision respectively,

Integrating and simulating hardware accelerators in TVM\r\n\r\nThis RFC proposes support for integrating hardware designs in TVM, specifically before they are manufactured in silicon or prototyped in an FPGA. Regardless of the hardware target, ML accelerators are built today using the *waterfall* approach described in the following figure:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"today\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2478335/100183190-29b91e00-2e93-11eb-85e7-87af707cc39a.png\">\r\n\r\nStarting from an accelerator idea, hardware is built incrementally for several weeks or months until it is prototyped. Once this happens, software teams start working on integrating this new piece of hardware to a particular ML framework of choice i.e., TVM. One challenge of this approach is the fact that hardware-design decisions are evaluated too late, which turns out to be counterproductive. Additionally, there are higher probabilities that the target ML model gets updated along the way, which makes the efficiency of this process critical.\r\n\r\nMotivated by this reality, we believe that ML accelerators should be integrated, and more importantly evaluated once the hardware design process begins. Notably, this approach allows engineers to have design feedback and hardware-software continuous integration from day one, as shown in the following figure:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"idea\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2478335/100183212-39d0fd80-2e93-11eb-94bb-a9b31fc4f82c.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nWe achieved this integration by leveraging the fact that most ML accelerators are funnel down to a common hardware language i.e., Verilog, regardless of the source language. Moreover, we have today efficient Verilog-to-C++ open-source compilers i.e., Verilator that can be used to interoperate with Verilog via a simple C interface (CFFI) from TVM.\r\n\r\nConcretely, this RFC consists on a simple codegen using BYOC, and an *opaque* kernel library, runtime, and device interface that can be implemented by engineers to efficiently integrate ML accelerators with TVM regardless of their design complexity. Also, we provide a small example (demo) that shows how to offload an `add` instruction from a Relay program to a simple hardware implementation (scalar adder) written in Verilog. This example is hosted on a third party repository called `hw-widgets` that we are planning to use for future hardware designs.\r\n\r\n@tmoreau89 @liangfu @jroesch

µTVM runtime has previously been fixed to use the builtin memory allocator. To avoid code duplication if an internal malloc is already linked, and as we look to a future where memory may need to be allocated in specific locations to support heterogenous execution, this PR allows each project to implement `TVMPlatformMemoryAllocate` and `TVMPlatformMemoryFree` to specify how to allocate tensor memory. Additionally, it makes the existing allocator available as a library.","created_at":"2020-11-23T04:46:57Z","updated_at":"2020-12-09T17:32:58Z","closed_at":"2020-12-09T17:32:58Z","merged_at":"2020-12-09T17:32:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"f606637ac7b0fc8efb4ab7529e11b851df8c3c36","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6948/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6948/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6948/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/7443a4021a586bc1fa5bc87beef311a618ffa4db","head":{"label":"areusch:utvm-custom-malloc","ref":"utvm-custom-malloc","sha":"7443a4021a586bc1fa5bc87beef311a618ffa4db","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":251458757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTE0NTg3NTc=","name":"tvm","full_name":"areusch/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/areusch/tvm","description":"Open

commit makes an internal API change in the µTVM transport library and which allows for some fixes to the GdbDebugger class, improving if not unbreaking the debug flow. When timeouts were introduced to the µTVM transport, it was assumed that a timeout was always wanted, since a lack of timeout could break automated tests. However, in debugging, this is is not the case--in fact, no timeouts are wanted, save on physical hardware where a session start retry timeout can be useful.\r\n\r\nOverall effects of this change:\r\n - When tvm.micro.transport.Transport.read() or tvm.micro.transport.Transport.write() are called, timeout_sec can now be None. When None, implementations should block forever. Previously, 0 could have meant \"block forever\" (almost always) or \"perform non-blocking I/O\" (in edge cases on session start). Now, there is an unambiguous meaning that matches pyserial.\r\n - When using GdbDebugger, never terminate the debugger. Always block on the debugger until the user exits. This allows the user to finish debugging problems without stepping on them in the event that a host-side exception occurs.\r\n - Immediately restore Ctrl+C handler when the debugger quits. If the debugger cleanup flow hangs, allows the user to typically find the problem by Ctrl+C. Before, explicit kill was required.","created_at":"2020-11-17T04:31:11Z","updated_at":"2020-11-19T19:32:38Z","closed_at":"2020-11-19T19:32:33Z","merged_at":"2020-11-19T19:32:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"580bf6dbaff1bd6d476e06efc5e58b5ab8f744b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

issue of the current auto_scheduler task serialization is that the workload won't be registered when deserializing a task so users have to manually call `register_workload_tensors` after deserialization. However, `register_workload_tensors` always uses compute DAG hash as the workload key. This could cause workload key mismatching if the task was from a TE function that uses function name as the workload key. This PR makes the following changes to make sure `WORKLOAD_FUNC_REGISTRY` is consist after deserializing a task.\r\n\r\n* Simplify `register_workload_tensors` by moving the ComputeDAG out.\r\n* Register the workload using the stored workload key when deserializing a task.\r\n\r\ncc @merrymercy @jcf94

search.\r\n```\r\nToo many errors happen in the tuning.

This discrepancy in behavior can be confusing to new users who may want to explore both methods of schedule searching. This PR proposes bringing the AutoScheduler handling of errors in measurement in line with AutoTvm.\r\n\r\nBy removing the LOG(FATAL) and changing verbosity for AutoScheduler in the same way we change logging level in AutoTvm the programs will behave the same. In addition, I changed the default verbosity of AutoScheduler to 0 (silent) in order to match the default logging level of AutoTvm.\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-12T20:57:10Z","updated_at":"2020-11-17T08:14:27Z","closed_at":"2020-11-17T08:14:02Z","merged_at":"2020-11-17T08:14:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"6c019983940b022f9082664f0b8a79279ad6478d","assignee":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:
