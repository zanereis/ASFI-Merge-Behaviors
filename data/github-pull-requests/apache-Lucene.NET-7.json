class.\n","created_at":"2016-03-11T20:51:23Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T18:06:34Z","closed_at":"2016-04-07T18:06:34Z","merged_at":"2016-04-07T18:06:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"7b8664729879f1a9d728f3db2eaad95e2f70e4a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/162/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/162/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/162/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/7b8664729879f1a9d728f3db2eaad95e2f70e4a2","head":{"label":"jozefizso:feature/spiloader_tests","ref":"feature/spiloader_tests","sha":"7b8664729879f1a9d728f3db2eaad95e2f70e4a2","user":{"login":"jozefizso","id":287778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4Nzc3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/287778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso","html_url":"https://github.com/jozefizso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53596617,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzU5NjYxNw==","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"jozefizso/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jozefizso","id":287778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4Nzc3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/287778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso","html_url":"https://github.com/jozefizso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jozefizso/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jozefizso/lucenenet","description":"Mirror

class has a BreakIterator concept that has no equivalent in .NET. However there is this project that is active and has a .NET bindings library available via nuget:\n\nhttp://site.icu-project.org/\n\n.NET library:\nhttps://github.com/niaher/icu4net\n\nI was able to use it and port CharArrayIterator tests which are all passing. It also looks like BreakIterator is used in other places in Analysis so we will have a solution for them with this PR.\n\nI did have to set platform to 32bit for analysis project in order for the tests to pass. ICU4NET and ICU dlls appear to be platform specific and only 32 bit bindings are available for .NET. I was able to download icu4net code and compile it with Visual C++. So down the road I can see if I can get 64 bit version packaged and submitted as PR to icu4net project or package it as our own or something like that.\n\nAnyway, do let me know if you think we should use something else for BreakIterator implementations or go with this. It does seem like the ICU project implements other components that Analysis uses that have no equivalent in .NET (e.g. Collations concept). I am completely new to ICU project but it appears to be very active and has regular meetings and released.\n","created_at":"2015-12-17T01:42:37Z","updated_at":"2016-01-14T12:00:17Z","closed_at":"2016-01-06T03:09:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7c61263dc0edf9326964f01cd0abc5ae8d1733c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/157/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/157/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/157/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/7eabbb14eaee9232e12e066557acca878b992dd9","head":{"label":"laimis:analysis_chararrayiterator","ref":"analysis_chararrayiterator","sha":"7eabbb14eaee9232e12e066557acca878b992dd9","user":{"login":"laimis","id":911757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/911757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis","html_url":"https://github.com/laimis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"8cef92b2f8f98d1e04f8978edb41488c789e9608","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache

noticed that running tests in 32 bit CPUs was introducing floating point rounding issues and tests were failing as the same calculation could produce different result if executed multiple times in a single test. After some discussions on the mailing list it was determined that on 32 bit machines different instructions are used from 64 bit machines to process floating point numbers. Intermediate results when transferred with higher precision to the next operations eventually lead to rounding errors once a final calculation is returned as float.\n\nFrom all the reading and trying several approaches so far, the only way I was able to consistently to get floating point conversion issues to go away is to pinvoke _controlfp_s to set floating point precision to 24 bits.\n\nI got the idea from https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2013/07/16/floating-point-determinism/, see section \"Floating-point settings (runtime)\", last paragraph. controlfp seems to come up in other suggestions around this issue as well. \n\nHere is the information on _controlfp_s: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c9676k6h.aspx. And it seems like there is an equivalent function in *nix environments although I haven't tried them or researched them in more depth yet.\n\nFor tests that rely on floating point calculations to be consistent, a variant of LuceneTestCase is used that sets the precision mask to 24 bits before each test run. I put this in the test as I don't think this code belongs to the core itself.\n","created_at":"2015-06-18T01:58:29Z","updated_at":"2015-06-21T19:47:22Z","closed_at":"2015-06-19T15:07:10Z","merged_at":"2015-06-19T15:07:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"4fed4aa89f81838ef8683814f54a6000c7939d90","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/150/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/150/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/150/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/c11e3683b9abcc67893e8a885066107d9f703f80","head":{"label":"laimis:controlfp_s","ref":"controlfp_s","sha":"c11e3683b9abcc67893e8a885066107d9f703f80","user":{"login":"laimis","id":911757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/911757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis","html_url":"https://github.com/laimis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f47779a7efb30d4ab3cfaa7d7e1bdae5b614fa7f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache

No matter how many times this is run on my machine in release or debug builds it never fails, but fails all the time on TC. A separate branch was created with more logging to see what the difference is between passing and failing cases and I arrived at the change that is in this PR.\n\nWhat the diagnostic output is showing is that Bottom > CalculateMaxBoost(MaxEdits) is evaluating to true in the failing cases when it really should be false.\n\nHere is the link to verbose branch so you can see what output means what:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/61c2d06814fa942331ce229e26553d6148a292fe/src/Lucene.Net.Core/Search/FuzzyTermsEnum.cs#L236\n\nHere is diagnostics info when the failure occurs:\n\nFuzzyTermsEnum bottom changed, lastTerm=, init=True, MaxEdits=1\n    termAfter=False, Bottom=0.857142866\n    subtract.  <----- this should never happen\n    oldMaxEdits=1, maxEdits=0\n    Max distance changed\n\nHere is the passing output:\n\nFuzzyTermsEnum bottom changed, lastTerm=, init=True, MaxEdits=1\n    termAfter=False, Bottom=0.857142866\n    oldMaxEdits=1, maxEdits=1  <-- note maxEdits=1 and not 0\n    Max distance changed\n\nThat maxEdits value change prevents 3 docs from being scored. That changes total hits from 5 to 2 and you can see that in the assert failure in the unit test.\n\nI suspect TestTopDocsMerge failures is the same issue. I am still trying to pin point which floating comparison is changing the results there but got myself into a situation where adding verbose output now makes it not fail in TC anymore.

seems like Lucene.Net NIOFSDirectory port has an issue when used in multiple threads for reading. Any test that is based on BasePostingsFormatTestCase, which runs multiple threads that read from directory, has a lot of errors in the logs when NIOFSDirectory is used as an implementation type of FSDirectory.\n\nYou can see the failures from the TC build logs, here are some of the highlights:\n\nSystem.Exception: Index was outside the bounds of the array. ---> System.IndexOutOfRangeException: Index was outside the bounds of the array.\nat System.IO.FileStream.ReadByte()\nat Lucene.Net.Support.FileStreamExtensions.Read(FileStream file, ByteBuffer dst, Int64 position) in z:\\Builds\\work\\bcdbe6b8cc677a49\\src\\Lucene.Net.Core\\Support\\FileStreamExtensions.cs:line 22\nat Lucene.Net.Store.NIOFSDirectory.NIOFSIndexInput.ReadInternal(Byte[] b, Int32 offset, Int32 len) in z:\\Builds\\work\\bcdbe6b8cc677a49\\src\\Lucene.Net.Core\\Store\\NIOFSDirectory.cs:line 252\nat Lucene.Net.Store.BufferedIndexInput.Refill() in z:\\Builds\\work\\bcdbe6b8cc677a49\\src\\Lucene.Net.Core\\Store\\BufferedIndexInput.cs:line 368\nat Lucene.Net.Store.BufferedIndexInput.ReadByte() in z:\\Builds\\work\\bcdbe6b8cc677a49\\src\\Lucene.Net.Core\\Store\\BufferedIndexIn\n\nSystem.Exception: read past EOF: NIOFSIndexInput(path=\"Z:\\Builds\\temp\\buildTmp\\LuceneTemp\\testPostingsFormat-1_0.tis\") off: 0 len: 543 pos: 24 chunkLen: 543 end: 567 ---> System.Exception: read past EOF: NIOFSIndexInput(path=\"Z:\\Builds\\temp\\buildTmp\\LuceneTemp\\testPostingsFormat-1_0.tis\") off: 0 len: 543 pos: 24 chunkLen: 543 end: 567\nat Lucene.Net.Store.NIOFSDirectory.NIOFSIndexInput.ReadInternal(Byte[] b, Int32 offset, Int32 len) in z:\\Builds\\work\\bcdbe6b8cc677a49\\src\\Lucene.Net.Core\\Store\\NIOFSDirectory.cs:line 256\nat Lucene.Net.Store.BufferedIndexInput.Refill() in z:\\Builds\\work\\bcdbe6b8cc677a49\\src\\Lucene.Net.Core\\Store\\BufferedIndexInput.cs:line 368\nat Lucene.Net.Store.BufferedIndexInput.ReadByte() in z:\\Builds\\work\\bcdbe6b8cc677a49\\src\\Lucene.Net.Core\\Store\\BufferedIndexInput.cs:line 55\nat Lucene.Net.Store.DataInput.ReadVInt() in z:\\Builds\\work\\bcdbe6b8cc677a49\\src\\Lucene.Net.Core\\Store\\DataInput.cs:line 117\n\ndocID is wrong\nExpected: 208378\nBut was:  208410\n\nThe tests don't fail because the pieces that are being tested pass, but I think this is causing failures in other tests when NIOFSDirectory is picked at random. After digging more into this, it seems like Lucene implementation relied on JRE specific FileChannel construct that is not available in .NET. The replacement in FileStreamExtensions is not thread safe because of the filestream seek calls it makes. Synchronizing that operation made all the tests clean. I reran the whole test suite for core with NIOFSDirectory as the Directory implementation and things seem to pass fine.\n\nNot sure what performance implications this has since it looks like the purpose of NIOFSDirectory was to provide an optimized version of SimpleFSDirectory that worked fast when reading from concurrent threads. As it stands, existing implementation is not safe to be used from multiple threads so perhaps adding the synchronization is the only option for us.\n","created_at":"2015-05-17T16:30:27Z","updated_at":"2015-12-06T13:15:05Z","closed_at":"2015-05-18T06:28:07Z","merged_at":"2015-05-18T06:28:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"e4d5f27801d8486bf6dccaa03cac7277b47874d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/147/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/147/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/147/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/ae1fc2a32b4eb3a347b301c8cb62dfad85acd6db","head":{"label":"laimis:niofsdirectory_synchronization","ref":"niofsdirectory_synchronization","sha":"ae1fc2a32b4eb3a347b301c8cb62dfad85acd6db","user":{"login":"laimis","id":911757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/911757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis","html_url":"https://github.com/laimis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e3833d6ccac28ed7879336e826cdeb5e3f9bdc77","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache

good number of tests fail with the error message stating that certain file cannot be accessed. Side by side comparison with what Lucene is doing while using Filemon showed that Lucene.Net version was opening the filestreams with correct FileAccess flag but incorrect FileShare flag. Instead of read it should have been ReadWrite.\n\nThe failure would occur when writer was disposed and it called IOUtils fsync. Fsync opens the stream again in FileAccess ReadWrite mode while at the same time there were readers that have the file opened with FileShare set to Read only.\n\nHere is the screenshot of the file handle opened when Lucene is running:\n\n![javaversion](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/911757/7439229/af717934-f041-11e4-84a6-42dd073eab08.PNG)\n\nAnd here is the

call.\n","created_at":"2015-04-26T17:33:15Z","updated_at":"2015-12-06T13:15:12Z","closed_at":"2015-04-26T21:32:36Z","merged_at":"2015-04-26T21:32:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"22a3b1dd719cc5cb5cb87b8f955f0a270477497f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/133/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/133/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/133/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/b692fc0d8156517b7625a37be7ffa3dce2a1c050","head":{"label":"laimis:indexablebinarystringtools_fix","ref":"indexablebinarystringtools_fix","sha":"b692fc0d8156517b7625a37be7ffa3dce2a1c050","user":{"login":"laimis","id":911757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/911757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis","html_url":"https://github.com/laimis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"38139379ba44e582b014fe8a5817779fa112be0a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache

fixes in this commit as the both are needed to fix the bug discovered in the failing BaseDocValuesFormatTestCase.TestVeryLargeButLegalSortedBytes when run with Lucene42DocValuesFormat.\n\nFirst commit replaces all the enumerables that reused the same instance variable to return enumeration values.\n\nSecond commit fixes a bug with reverse byte reader anonymous class to match Lucene's version:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/lucene_solr_4_8_0/lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/util/fst/BytesStore.java#L419\n\nNote how a private byte[] current pointer is used to keep track of the current byte block that the iterator is traveling through. In Lucene.Net port the private array was left unused and instead the higher level \"current\" was modified which is used and modified by other iterators at the same time.\n\nIt only affected Lucene42 because it uses FST to store the sorted doc values. Also it affected only the large bytes test because it needs a value large enough where multiple byte blocks come into play and that's where \"current block\" mistakenly was pointed to a wrong one.\n\nThe assert console output has gone away and the TestVeryLargeButLegalSortedBytes test passes. I am seeing those assert \"frozenHash vs h\" messages in other Lucene42 tests, investigating right now.\n","created_at":"2015-04-16T01:12:56Z","updated_at":"2015-12-06T13:15:29Z","closed_at":"2015-04-16T01:30:43Z","merged_at":"2015-04-16T01:30:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"4250b50b145da188a5fb3654ffc3f17c4606df7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/128/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/128/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/128/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/8b9ae9cbb7d77e04924d4df260ce09372f47e3e6","head":{"label":"laimis:enumerable_fix","ref":"enumerable_fix","sha":"8b9ae9cbb7d77e04924d4df260ce09372f47e3e6","user":{"login":"laimis","id":911757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/911757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis","html_url":"https://github.com/laimis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b4eaf2fc441dfd5d32732eda844ef1e8e62588a1","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache

a bug where bytes were written to the index incorrectly if Lucene40Codec was used. The issue can be observed by following the data flow starting here:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/src/Lucene.Net.TestFramework/Codecs/lucene40/Lucene40DocValuesWriter.cs#L176\n\nvalues.ToArray() enumeration instead of returning an array of different values, it returns an array with all members pointing to the same bytesref instance. This broke logic to detect min / max Lengths down the stream and as a result incorrect bytes were written to an index.\n\nThis bug did not show up until the Lucene40DocValuesWriter was rewritten to call ToArray(). Here is a gist illustrating the difference between the two usages with bug in place: https://gist.github.com/laimis/d49291d2f02a7f4830bf\n\nThe fix removes  BytesRef value = new BytesRef(); initialization and instead initializes new bytes ref instance anytime one should be returned.\n\nThere might be more places in code base that suffer from this, will need to review the iterators that use similar approach.\n\nWith the fix in place all Lucene40Codec tests pass.\n","created_at":"2015-04-11T13:16:20Z","updated_at":"2015-12-06T13:15:29Z","closed_at":"2015-04-11T18:48:29Z","merged_at":"2015-04-11T18:48:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"ebec40ed1b9e4f05e0506454a93248eedf6a6625","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/127/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/127/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/127/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/07648a3b20ea9055bbae91cc5cf529c8fe1fc3f3","head":{"label":"laimis:binarydocvalueswriter_fixes","ref":"binarydocvalueswriter_fixes","sha":"07648a3b20ea9055bbae91cc5cf529c8fe1fc3f3","user":{"login":"laimis","id":911757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/911757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis","html_url":"https://github.com/laimis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"31a43f02a9dd9bbffaa5d728d0e942642a74dd79","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache

http://teamcity.codebetter.com/viewLog.html?buildId=185366&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=LuceneNet_Core#testNameId-1093084322476268678). Trying to run it locally with timeout restriction removed resulted in the test process using 4 or more GB of RAM within seconds. After looking into it more, narrowed down what was triggering the condition: bug in Bits2words logic which would get triggered when numBits parameter was set to 0.\n\nTo reproduce and observe the results, run TestOpenBitSet.TestSmall test and put a breakpoint here https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/src/Lucene.Net.Tests/core/Util/TestOpenBitSet.cs#L174 with condition of sz == 0 so that it triggers when random int generation returns 0. You will see then that OpenBitSet constructor instead of initializing bits array of 0 length will initialize it to 67108864 and then it is all downhill from there.\n\nVerified the fix by running Lucene Java tests and made sure the math came out the same for 0 input, where the result is 0 instead of 67108864.\n\nHere is Java version:

that use RegExp queries were failing because RegExp implementation had a bug in how it dealt with simple character regular expressions. Lucene version makes sure to append characters based on the codepoint value, while .NET version was simply appending code point value that would get translated into string. (if code point value was set to 48 which is 0, resulting expression was \"48\" and not \"0\").\n\nHere is Lucene code for reference https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/lucene_solr_4_8_0/lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/util/automaton/RegExp.java, note the places it uses appendCodePoint.\n\nThis fixes failures in the tests that use RegExp, e.g. http://teamcity.codebetter.com/viewLog.html?buildId=185033&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=LuceneNet_Core#testNameId3978078468772906159\n\nIn addition TestWildcardRandom and TestRegexpRandom were failing as they initialized data using incorrect value format for the decimal string.

out).\n","created_at":"2015-03-07T12:30:01Z","updated_at":"2015-12-06T13:15:32Z","closed_at":"2015-03-07T17:29:27Z","merged_at":"2015-03-07T17:29:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"d33db9f663d544abc43a4ee7f4ecf48db48e5a95","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/122/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/122/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/122/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/925c280bb1e095110c1cbc06b0d151460f1abf31","head":{"label":"laimis:regexp_fixes","ref":"regexp_fixes","sha":"925c280bb1e095110c1cbc06b0d151460f1abf31","user":{"login":"laimis","id":911757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/911757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis","html_url":"https://github.com/laimis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"dd7dba7a68f6e22d65d40551857aa9c57674f698","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache

PQ's unit tests. Previously they were not testing units but rather the whole data structure in one single test. The set of tests for each method is the following:\n- public PriorityQueue(int maxSize): TestMaxSizeBounds.\n- public PriorityQueue(int maxSize, bool prepopulate): TestPrepopulation.\n- public T Add(T element): TestAdd, TestDuplicates, TestOverflow.\n- public virtual T InsertWithOverflow(T element): TestInsertWithOverflowDoesNotOverflow, TestInsertWithOverflowDiscardsRight.\n- public T Top(): TestAdd.\n- public T Pop(): TestPop.\n- public T UpdateTop(): TestUpdateTop.\n- public int Size(): TestFixedSize, TestPop.\n- public void Clear(): TestClear.\n- private void UpHeap(): Tested via Add's tests.\n- private void DownHeap(): Tested via Pop's tests.\n\nAlso, I included three non-unit tests:\n- Benchmark: A benchmarking routine. Measures execution times for Add and Pop.\n- TestStress: Aims to reproduce a high-loaded real scenario usage.\n- TestPersistence: Tests that there is no loss of data when adding and popping elements.\n\nEven I did some really small changes on the PQ, its interface remains the same.\n\nMy main goal with these changes is to make future verifications on any changes on the data structure easy and reliable.

as the expected type That does not match the Lucene version:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/lucene_solr_4_8_0/lucene/core/src/test/org/apache/lucene/index/TestIndexWriterExceptions.java#L185\n\nFixed that and used a more explicit exception type to make sure that we are handling only the expected exception and nothing else.\n","created_at":"2015-02-09T01:12:54Z","updated_at":"2015-02-09T01:16:44Z","closed_at":"2015-02-09T01:16:44Z","merged_at":"2015-02-09T01:16:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"f2ad4a623617da47b417c23d305b4312f7a7fecf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/89/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/89/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/89/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/150651bc1be9d5a25f1b87881db0083cc4ea3ea4","head":{"label":"laimis:index_fixes","ref":"index_fixes","sha":"150651bc1be9d5a25f1b87881db0083cc4ea3ea4","user":{"login":"laimis","id":911757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/911757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis","html_url":"https://github.com/laimis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"af785e29c1cd41f6535fa417d8dba7c9d9c82fc9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache
