Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11098](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11098) Deprecates `ProcessContext.encrypt()` and `ProcessContext.decrypt()` methods. The deprecated `GetJMSTopic` Processor is the only component using these methods, and they should be removed in a subsequent major release due to the tight coupling between framework configuration settings and potential Processor use of these methods.\r\n\r\nChanges include adding deprecation logging in `ProcessContext` implementations to provide runtime warnings for referencing

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10932](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10932) Changes the internal Security Provider from Bouncy Castle to the standard Sun JSSE when reading and writing PKCS12 Key Store files.\r\n\r\nThe TLS Toolkit included custom handling for PKCS12 that specified `null` for the Key Password, which causes problems when using the Java `keytool` command to read a PKCS12 Trust Store. Removing this `null` setting and using the standard Security Provider for PKCS12 allow `keytool` and other services to read and write PKCS12 Trust Stores as expected.\r\n\r\nChanges for [NIFI-2943](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-2943) in PR #1165 switched to using the Bouncy Castle Security Provider for PKCS12 in NiFi 1.1.0. These changes were implemented to address issues with PKCS12 handling in earlier Java versions. More recent versions of Java have improved PKCS12 support to the point where [JEP 229](https://openjdk.org/jeps/229) changed the default Key Store Type from JKS to PKCS12 in Java 9 and later. With these changes, the standard Java implementation of PKCS12 should be preferred.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n###

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10580](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10580) Upgrades SLF4J from 1.7.36 to 2.0.6 and upgrades Logback from 1.2.11 to 1.3.5.\r\n\r\nSLF4J 2.0 does not introduce any breaking API changes to standard interfaces, but changes the initialization process, which requires a minimum Logback version of 1.3.0. Logback 1.4.0 requires Java 11, so Logback 1.3.5 is the current compatible version.\r\n\r\nSpring Boot 2.7 provides a logging system implementation based on Logback 1.2, but the initialization process is not compatible with Logback 1.3. NiFi Registry does not depend on the Spring Boot logging initialization, so disabling the initialization using a System property resolves startup issues.\r\n\r\nZooKeeper has a dependency on Logback, which creates issues when running some tests, but excluding Logback resolves those issues.\r\n\r\nThe ZooKeeperMigratorTest.groovy creates a test ZooKeeper server using an Apache Curator class that relies on Logback 1.2. This test is written in Groovy and uses Spock, so this pull request removes the test class.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11064](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11064) Changes `TestPutSFTP.testRunTransitUriDifferentHosts()` to run multiple times for improved test stability. The current implementation adds two files to the queue, but fails intermittently when only one file is processed. There is a separate `testRunBatching` method to handle testing support for batched file processing, so changes in `testRunTransitUriDifferentHosts` make this particular method more reliable for the scenario being evaluated.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11048](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11048) Adds a custom `StandardFileNameCompleter` in `nifi-toolkit-cli` to avoid hanging on regular expression parsing of the `LS_COLORS` environment variable on some platforms, such as Fedora 37 with Java 8.\r\n\r\nThe JLine 3 `Completers.FileNameCompleter` in version 3.19.0 and following calls `Styles.lsStyle()`, which resolves the `LS_COLORS` environment variable and attempts to parse the style information. The `StandardFileNameCompleter` provides a workaround using a hard-coded style for `LS_COLORS` based on the default value in JLine 3.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking

This is needed functionality as in the current iteration of the Cassandra processor, a \"select * from\" query returns a single very large flow file. This will allow for smaller flowfiles to be outputted, increasing the performance associated with this processor.

You need to enable `include-kafka-aws` profile to include the required module. A previous PR (https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5291) tried to tackle this problem. In this PR, though, we decided not to include `awsRoleArn, awsRoleSessionName, awsStsRegion` as properties because they just add extra complexity with minimal value. When NiFi runs in EC2, and no profile is specified, the processor will use the role assigned to the EC2 instance. When NiFi runs locally, we can define a profile name that will reference a profile in` ~/.aws/credentials` (depends on os) file. In this file, you can specify the above properties along with the access key id and secret.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11022](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11022) Adds the following new Processors to support decryption of content encrypted using the `EncryptContent` Processor:\r\n\r\n- `DecryptContentCompatibilityMode`\r\n- `DecryptContentEncoded`\r\n\r\nA new `nifi-cipher-bundle` with `nifi-cipher-nar` module contains the new Processors. A new `nifi-security-crypto-key` module in `nifi-commons` provides standard interfaces and implementations of strong Key Derivation Functions using Bouncy Castle components.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the new Processors is to maintain components that are capable of decrypting historical information without needing to maintain encryption of insecure and custom formats.\r\n\r\n## DecryptContentCompatibilityMode\r\n\r\nThe `DecryptContentCompatibilityMode` Processor focuses on legacy Password-Based Encryption algorithms, many of which are defined in [RFC 8018](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8018). The Processor supports a `Key Derivation Strategy` using either [OpenSSL EVP BytesToKey](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man3/EVP_BytesToKey.html) or [Jasypt Java simplified encryption](http://www.jasypt.org/). These settings map to the OpenSSL and NiFi Legacy settings in the `EncryptContent` Processor. Neither of these key derivation strategies meet the security requirements of modern cryptography, so the `DecryptContentCompatibilityMode` Processor exists exclusively to provide compatibility with historical modes of encryption. This Processor relies on the Bouncy Castle Security Provider to support cipher operations, but avoids global registration of the provider.\r\n\r\n## DecryptContentEncoded\r\n\r\nThe `DecryptContentEncoded` Processor focuses on newer Key Derivation Functions, supporting Argon2, bcrypt, PBKDF2, and scrypt algorithms. The Processor supports selection of `Cipher Algorithm Mode` and `Cipher Algorithm Padding`, defaulting to `GCM` and `NoPadding` respectively. These settings match the default configuration of `EncryptContent` for the AES symmetric cipher. The `EncryptContent` Processor and supporting implementation components write encrypted content using a format that is specific to Apache NiFi, and also write the content header using a standard byte format specific to each support Key Derivation Function. The `DecryptContentEncoded` Processor leverages this standard byte formatting to determine the appropriate Key Derivation Function for decryption. The Processor supports a `Key Specification Format` property, defaulting to `PASSWORD`, but also allowing `RAW` to enable configuration of a raw key encoded as a hexadecimal string. Both the `DecryptContentEncoded` Processor and the supporting `nifi-security-crypto-key` library include extensive tests to exercise byte format detection and cipher algorithm configurations.\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11015](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11015) Corrects NiFi Registry configuration processing of the Trust Store Type property for the internal Jetty Server. Recent refactoring in NiFi 1.19.0 incorrectly used the Key Store Type property as the Trust Store Type, resulting in startup failures when the Trust Store Type was different from the Key Store Type. Changes include adjusting the associated unit test to build a TLS Configuration with JKS as the Trust Store Type, instead of the default PKCS12, which validates the expected behavior. \r\n\r\n#

href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/releases\">hazelcast's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v4.2.6</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast IMDG 4.2.z releases. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.</p>\n<p>==== 4.2.6 ====</p>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrade jackson-databind to 2.14.0. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22391\">#22391</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue where replication over WAN was failing on the source cluster members, when there are multiple batch publishers configured in a single WAN replication. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22496\">#22496</a></li>\n<li>Fixed a memory leak due to incomplete clean-up of backup replica sync operations. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22406\">#22406</a></li>\n<li>Fixed the cluster failure occurred after requesting healthcheck of a member using REST API while the <code>hazelcast.socket.buffer.direct</code> property is enabled. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21702\">#21702</a></li>\n<li>Improved connection handling. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21643\">#21643</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where a cluster could not be formed when security is enabled, various client permissions are set,\nand multiple members are started simultaneously. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21508\">#21508</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>==== 4.2.5 ====</p>\n<p>If you’re using eviction or expiration for maps, you must set the per-entry-stats-enabled property to true to fix an issue in version 4.2.x where some map entries are not always evicted or expired according to their time-to-live or maximum idle duration configurations.</p>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduced a system property for allowing you to audit that all the Hazelcast instances running in your environment have the instance tracking file name set correctly in the configuration. See the note in Instance Tracking. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19929\">#19929</a></li>\n<li>Enabled XXE (XML External Entity Reference) protection for XMLInputFactory. The issue was reported through <a href=\"https://huntr.dev/bounties/d63972a2-b910-480a-a86b-d1f75d24d563/\">https://huntr.dev/bounties/d63972a2-b910-480a-a86b-d1f75d24d563/</a>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/20942\">#20942</a></li>\n<li>The probe level for most of the network related statistics has been changed to &quot;DEBUG&quot; to decrease the pressure on Management Center; now they are not sent to Management Center by default. If you want to see these statistics, you need to set the &quot;hazelcast.metrics.debug.enabled&quot; property to true. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21275\">#21275</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the statistics like puts and removals were not increasing when these operations are executed through Transactional interface. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21105\">#21105</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where Hazelcast clients, which have only the IP address of a member to connect (but the member also has a hostname), were not able to connect to the cluster. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/20631\">#20631</a></li>\n<li>Hazelcast’s memcached implementation was interpreting the number values and parameters for incr and decr wrongly (numbers were being converted into byte arrays instead of decimals). This has been fixed by making these commands' implementations strictly follow the memcached protocol specification. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19676\">#19676</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the totalPublishes statistics for the Reliable Topic data structure were always generated as 0. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19656\">#19656</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the map.clear() and cache.clear() methods were evicting all entries in all near caches of all the maps in a cluster, not only the map on which these methods are called. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19501\">#19501</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue that caused some map entries to remain in Hazelcast even when you configured eviction or expiration. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19483\">#19483</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Removed/Deprecated Features</h2>\n<p>The following system properties have been deprecated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>hazelcast.client.statistics.enabled</li>\n<li>hazelcast.client.statistics.period.seconds</li>\n</ul>\n<p>==== 4.2.4 =====</p>\n<p>For the distributions packages of IMDG, we updated the vulnerable version of log4j2 in Management Center to 2.17.0.
