PR makes two changes to code in the ReplicaManager.updateFollowerFetchState path, which is in the hot path for follower fetches. Although calling ReplicaManager.updateFollowerFetch state is inexpensive on its own, it is called once for each partition every time a follower fetch occurs.\r\n\r\n1. updateFollowerFetchState no longer calls maybeExpandIsr when the follower is already in the ISR. This avoid repeated expansion checks. \r\n2. Partition.maybeIncrementLeaderHW is also in the hot path for ReplicaManager.updateFollowerFetchState. Partition.maybeIncrementLeaderHW calls Partition.remoteReplicas four times each iteration, and it performs a toSet conversion. maybeIncrementLeaderHW now avoids generating any intermediate collections when updating the HWM.\r\n\r\n**Benchmark results for Partition.updateFollowerFetchState on a r5.xlarge:**\r\nOld:\r\n```\r\n  1288.633 ±(99.9%) 1.170 ns/op [Average]\r\n  (min, avg, max) = (1287.343,

plugin class loading, instance creation, and configuration\r\nchange the current thread's context ClassLoader\r\nto the PluginClassLoader. This prevents issues where\r\nstatic initialization loads the wrong resources, or\r\nfails to find resources that are inside the plugin.\r\nThis change impacts the following classes:\r\nPlugins, DelegatingClassLoader, Worker.\r\n\r\nIn order to verify the original bug and verify the fix,\r\na group of test plugins for collecting data are included in this commit:\r\n\r\n* `AlwaysThrowException` shows that exceptions are captured\r\n* `Sampling` is for basic initialization and field aliasing\r\n* `SamplingConverter` takes samples during converter method calls\r\n* `SamplingHeaderConverter` takes samples during header converter method calls\r\n* `SamplingConfigProvider` takes samples during config provider method calls\r\n* `SamplingConfigurable` takes samples during configurable method calls\r\n* `ServiceLoaderPlugin` samples the active classloader for service loaded classes\r\n\r\nThese plugins are stored in the resources directory.\r\nEach plugin has it's own source tree, and can have arbitrary code.\r\nThe plugins are compiled into class files in a separate temporary directory.\r\nThey are then packaged into a jar in a temporary file \r\nwhich is deleted after the process exits.\r\nThis jar is then exposed for use in `plugin.path`, and tests\r\ncan access to the plugin class names through constants.\r\n\r\nThese changes will be backported to all versions of AK which have plugin isolation (introduced in `0.11.0.0`):\r\n* `0.11.0.4`\r\n* `1.0.3`\r\n* `1.1.2`\r\n* `2.0.2`\r\n* `2.1.2`\r\n* `2.2.2`\r\n* `2.3.1`\r\n* `2.4`\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

source connectors that publish on multiple topics it is essential to be able to configure transforms to be active only for certain topics.\r\n\r\nThis adds the possibility to define a whitelist of topics each single message transform (SMT) is applied to by adding a comma-separated list of these topics as key `topics` to the transforms configuration.\r\n\r\nIt solves [KAFKA-8660](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-8660) not only for a single but for all SMTs and is an alternative to #7084.\r\n\r\nSince this introduces a change breaking backwards compatibility (because anyone could have used `topics` as a configuration key already), this PR is merely a request for comments: would this be something the maintainers of this project would be interested in adding? If yes, a strategy for smooth migration would be needed, and I would add the needed integration tests and documentation.\r\n\r\n## Example configuration:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntransforms: \"ValueToKey\"\r\ntransforms.ValueToKey.type: \"org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.ValueToKey\"\r\ntransforms.ValueToKey.fields: \"userId,city,state\"\r\ntransforms.ValueToKey.topics: \"my-addresses\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes sure the transform `ValueToKey` is only applied for records published on the `my-addresses` topic.","created_at":"2019-09-06T13:53:07Z","updated_at":"2024-12-23T03:37:11Z","closed_at":"2024-12-23T03:37:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

But if any update arrives between step #1 and #3\r\nthen that update is missed. It breaks following use case:\r\n\r\n1. Create a topic with default configuration, and immediately after that\r\n2. Update the configuration of topic\r\n\r\nThere is a race condition here and in random cases update made in\r\nseocond step will get dropped.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes it by tracking updates arriving between step #1 and #3\r\nOnce a Partition is done initialzing log, it checks if it has missed any\r\nupdate. If yes, then the configuration is read from ZK again.\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests to make sure a dirty configuration is refreshed.

In the PR for that ticket (#7207) it was\r\nacknowledged that this was a brittle way to test for the exception. We\r\nnow see occasional failures because an unrelated ERROR level log entry\r\nis made while closing the task.\r\n\r\nThis change eliminates the brittle log checking by rethrowing any time\r\nan exception occurs in close, even when a subsequent unclean close\r\nsucceeds. This has the potential benefit of uncovering other supressed\r\nexceptions down the road.\r\n\r\nI've verified that even with us rethrowing on `closeUnclean` that all\r\ntests pass.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary. The PR title and PR message become\r\nthe squashed commit message, so use a separate\r\ncomment to ping reviewers.*\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix. Unit and/or integration\r\ntests are expected for any behaviour change and\r\nsystem tests should be considered for larger changes.*\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n-

patch fixes a couple problems with logging of request/response objects which include records data. First, it adds a missing `toString` to `LazyDownConversionRecords`. Second, it changes the `toString` of `MemoryRecords` to not print record-level information. This was always a dangerous practice, but it was especially bad when these objects ended up in request logs. With this patch, implementations use `toString` only to print summary details.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

creates a test that generates sustained connections against Kafka.  There\r\nare three different components we can stress with this, KafkaConsumer,\r\nKafkaProducer, and AdminClient.  This test tries use minimal bandwidth per\r\nconnection to reduce overhead impacts.\r\n\r\nThis test works by creating a threadpool that creates connections and then\r\nmaintains a central pool of connections at a specified keepalive rate.  The\r\nkeepalive action varies by which component is being stressed:\r\n\r\n  * KafkaProducer:  Sends one single produce record.  The configuration for\r\n    the produce request uses the same key/value generator as the ProduceBench\r\n    test.\r\n\r\n  * KafkaConsumer: Subscribes to a single partition, seeks to the end, and\r\n    then polls a minimal number of records.  Each consumer connection is its\r\n    own consumer group, and defaults to 1024 bytes as FETCH_MAX_BYTES to keep\r\n    traffic to a minimum.\r\n\r\n  * AdminClient: Makes an API call to get the nodes in the cluster.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This test is designed to be run alongside a ProduceBench test for a\r\nspecific topic, due to the way the Consumer test polls a single partition.\r\nThere may be no data returned by the consumer test if this is run on its own.\r\nThe connection should still be kept alive, but with no data returned.","created_at":"2019-09-03T21:13:20Z","updated_at":"2019-09-09T02:49:26Z","closed_at":"2019-09-09T02:49:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1c253b6beccc14e0bc2e6e732f10b7a912049965","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7289/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7289/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7289/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/e51bea2646183f4f58bccbad8fd7bd9c8348f286","head":{"label":"scott-hendricks:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"e51bea2646183f4f58bccbad8fd7bd9c8348f286","user":{"login":"scott-hendricks","id":49452084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NDUyMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49452084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks","html_url":"https://github.com/scott-hendricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206123323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDYxMjMzMjM=","name":"kafka","full_name":"scott-hendricks/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scott-hendricks","id":49452084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NDUyMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49452084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks","html_url":"https://github.com/scott-hendricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scott-hendricks/kafka","description":"Mirror

we have ephemeral brokers sitting behind a Virtual IP and when all the brokers go down, the client won't be able to reconnect as mentioned in: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7931. This is because we take the bootstrap nodes and completely forget about it once the first metadata response comes in (and then we create a new metadata cache and a new cluster). Now when all the brokers go down before the metadata is updated, then the client will be stuck unless it is rebooted. \r\n\r\nThis patch simply stores the bootstrap brokers list. Instead of simply giving up when a 'leastLoadedNode' is not found, we simply use one of the bootstrap nodes to get the metadata. Also we can make sure to use the bootstrap nodes only when the bootstrap node is not part of the set of nodes on the cluster.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n--------\r\n* Manual Testing - Setup ephemeral brokers behind a VIP.

adds an administrative API to delete consumer offsets of a group as well as extends the mechanism to expire offsets of consumer groups.\r\n\r\nIt makes the group coordinator aware of the set of topics a consumer group (protocol type == 'consumer') is actively subscribed to, allowing offsets of topics which are not actively subscribed to by the group to be either expired or administratively deleted. The expiration rules remain the same.\r\n\r\nFor the other groups (non-consumer), the API allows to delete offsets when the group is empty and the expiration remains the same.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

change adds a command line option to the `ducker-ak up` command to\r\nenable exposing ports from docker containers. The exposed ports will be\r\nmapped to the ephemeral ports on the host. The option is called\r\n`expose-ports` and can take either a single value (like 5005) or a range\r\n(like 5005-5009). This port will then exposed from each docker container\r\nthat ducker-ak sets up.\r\n\r\nHere is one command line example:\r\n\r\n> ./docker/ducker-ak up --expose-ports 5005\r\n\r\nAfter doing this, docker will report mapped ports.

attempted to fix a flaky test, however the tests remained inconsistent even after the fix. Since this test is not reproducible locally, modifying the Jenkins builds and digging through the logs would help debug the cause of this issue.\r\n\r\nPotential causes for this test's failure:\r\n1. Client (consumer) did not get metadata for this partition\r\n2. Client's metadata is out-of-date\r\n3. Broker that hosts the leader does not know it is the leader.\r\n4. It takes along time to consume\r\n\r\nFindings:\r\n- Adding asserts before consuming records to ensure the client has up-to-date metadata was not the problem.\r\n- When running only the individual test, the test passes all checks.\r\n- When running only integration tests, the test failed failed inconsistently.\r\n- When running all JUnit and integration tests, the test failed inconsistently.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

patch contains a few improvements on the offset range handling when computing the cleanable range of offsets.\r\n\r\n1. It adds bounds checking to ensure the dirty offset cannot be larger than the log end offset. If it is, we reset to the log start offset.\r\n2. It adds a method to get the non-active segments in the log while holding the lock. This ensures that a truncation cannot lead to an invalid segment range.\r\n3. It improves exception messages in the case that an inconsistent segment range is provided so that we have more information to find the root cause.\r\n\r\nThe patch also fixes a few problems in `LogCleanerManagerTest` due to unintended reuse of the underlying log directory.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

than maintain hand coded protocol serialization code, Streams could use the same code-generation framework as Clients/Core.\r\n\r\nThere isn't a perfect match, since the code generation framework includes an assumption that you're generating \"protocol messages\", rather than just arbitrary blobs, but I think it's close enough to justify using it, and improving it over time.\r\n\r\nUsing the code generation allows us to drop a lot of detail-oriented, brittle, and hard-to-maintain serialization logic in favor of a schema spec.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit
