PR adds support for the federated left indexing instruction with a scalar rhs, including the respective tests.\r\nWhen running the FederatedLeftIndexTest, it throws an exception because of invalid matrix dimensions (-1, -1) at the first test run. The second test run passes. Somehow this exception is only thrown if the two frame tests (_testLeftIndexFullDenseFrameCP_, _testLeftIndexFullDenseFrameSP_) are executed before the failing scalar test (_testLeftIndexScalarCP_). I tried to put the empty matrix for the output to the federated workers with the correct sliced dimensions instead of [-1, -1], but then we get a \"file does not exist on hdfs\" exception. Any idea or suspicion why this could be the case?\r\n\r\nThanks for review

PR introduces the reuse of serialized federated responses. In order to avoid redundant serialization, we put the serialized byte array of federated responses containing a CacheBlock into the lineage cache and mark it with a separate lineage item for serialization derived from the lineage item of the underlying data. The next time the same data is requested, the serialization process for the federated response is skipped and the cached bytes are loaded directly into the output buffer.\r\nThe implementation overrides the encode method of netty's ObjectEncoder to check whether we can reuse the serialization prior to the actual encoding, and to obtain and store the serialized bytes after the encoding.\r\n\r\nThanks for review

PR replaces the ObjectEncoders for encoding federated communication messages (i.e., FederatedRequest and FederatedResponse) with a respective FederatedRequestEncoder and FederatedResponseEncoder. These two new classes extent from ObjectEncoder and override the allocateBuffer method in order to allocate the buffer with an initial capacity corresponding to the FederatedRequest/FederatedResponse instead of the default value of 256.\r\nI've tried estimating the entire serialized size of the requests and responses to allocate the exact size needed, but haven't found a good solution for it because of the many cases to consider. Hence, the initial capacity in this PR only results from taking into consideration a static offset (FederatedRequest: 512, FederatedResponse: 312), the size of the CacheBlock parameters, and the length of the lineage trace (only for FederatedRequests).\r\nIn my experiments with a matrix of dimensions 600.000x200, it reduces the encoding time from 50 seconds to 1.9 seconds. :tada:

PR addresses the problem of differentiating between different slices from the same broadcast data object. At the moment we can only identify broadcast slices by its original data object, not by its slice indices. This leads to reuse collisions when broadcasting two different slices from the same original file (i.e., different slice indices). However, this PR resolves the problem by appending the slice indices in form of a RightIndex lineage item to the transferred lineage trace. Then, we can identify the slice range on the federatet worker, and hence differentiate between the different data slices.\r\n\r\nThanks for review :)\r\n\r\nPS: Note that github shows the added test _FederatedReuseSlicesTest_ as if the _FederatedReadCacheTest_ would have been renamed. That is actually not the case. The _FederatedReadCacheTest_ was actually replaced by the _FederatedReuseReadTest_ when we added the lineage based reuse of read objects. However, somehow this test managed to get again into the system by a mistaken rebase, I am sorry for that.

This would be most commonly affecting users on GHES 3.3 or before, as those runners do not support node16 actions and they can use actions from github.com via <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/enabling-automatic-access-to-githubcom-actions-using-github-connect\">github connect</a> or manually copying the repo to their GHES instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Few dependencies and cache action usage examples have also been updated.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.7</h2>\n<p>Support 10GB cache upload using the latest version <code>1.0.8</code> of <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/cache\"><code>@actions/cache</code> </a></p>\n<h2>v2.1.6</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Catch unhandled &quot;bad file descriptor&quot; errors that sometimes occurs when the cache server returns non-successful response (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/pull/596\">actions/cache#596</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.5</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix permissions error seen when extracting caches with GNU tar that were previously created using BSD tar (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/issues/527\">actions/cache#527</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.4</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Make caching more verbose <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/toolkit/pull/650\">#650</a></li>\n<li>Use GNU tar on macOS if available <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/toolkit/pull/701\">#701</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrades <code>@actions/core</code> to v1.2.6 for <a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mfwh-5m23-j46w\">CVE-2020-15228</a>. This action was not using the affected methods.</li>\n<li>Fix error handling in <code>uploadChunk</code> where 400-level errors were not being detected and handled correctly</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds input to limit the chunk upload size, useful for self-hosted runners with slower upload speeds</li>\n<li>No-op when executing on GHES</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update <code>@actions/cache</code> package to <code>v1.0.2</code> which allows cache action to use posix format when taring files.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Replaces the <code>http-client</code> with the Azure Storage SDK for NodeJS when downloading cache content from Azure.  This should help improve download performance and reliability as the SDK downloads files in 4 MB chunks, which can be parallelized and retried independently</li>\n<li>Display download progress and speed</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/cache/commit/4b0cf6cc4619e737324ddfcec08fff2413359514\"><code>4b0cf6c</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/issues/769\">#769</a> from actions/users/ashwinsangem/bump_major_version</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/cache/commit/60c606a2b4c5358e11c2ca7b4694e59049d008d1\"><code>60c606a</code></a> Update licensed files</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/cache/commit/b6e9a919a7da3606e9b2db756823ee1c39c7b48d\"><code>b6e9a91</code></a> Revert &quot;Updated to the latest version.&quot;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/cache/commit/c8425035834f98c304ecf92f5d50f41d433885c1\"><code>c842503</code></a> Updated to the latest version.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/cache/commit/2b7da2a62c3af9fa2692cd8d2d117da76faf31ac\"><code>2b7da2a</code></a> Bumped up to a major version.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/cache/commit/deae296ab340574da1ec86242984dfc91f0a7b81\"><code>deae296</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/issues/651\">#651</a> from magnetikonline/fix-golang-windows-example</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/cache/commit/c7c46bcb6db3c571021a3a2dc2d2557b512ecace\"><code>c7c46bc</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/issues/707\">#707</a> from duxtland/main</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/cache/commit/6535c5fb5fe2870754afba7bd4e514867ac9cb98\"><code>6535c5f</code></a> Regenerated <code>examples.md</code> TOC</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/cache/commit/3fdafa472e0db16435add384585aa138ffdd16d3\"><code>3fdafa4</code></a> Update GitHub Actions status badge markdown in <code>README.md</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/cache/commit/341e6d75d9826beb2fa659263d862f6aec63a064\"><code>341e6d7</code></a> Merge branch 'actions:main' into fix-golang-windows-example</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/cache/compare/v2...v3\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=actions/cache&package-manager=github_actions&previous-version=2&new-version=3)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

patch adds a rewrite to avoid vector intermediates in the generated row template of connected components by doing the elementwise multiplication, row_maxs and max in one pass.\r\n\r\nWorks only for a certain small input size. Then other rewrites seem to get to modify the DAG before this pattern can be tested. E.g., tested with 1000 nodes -> works, tested with 100000 nodes -> pattern not applied because DAG is already different.\r\n\r\nThis is for java codegen only.

PR introduces the MatrixLineagePair as a wrapper around a _MatrixObject_ with its corresponding _LineageItem_ in order to nicely couple the information of the lineage with a matrix until we broadcast it to the federated worker. The lineage trace is then included inside the PUT request of the matrix and transferred to the federated worker. To do this, this PR includes also a refactoring of the federated instructions which changes the MatrixObjects into MatrixLineagePairs whenever they are broadcast.\r\n\r\nThanks for review

PR introduces the mechanics for tranferring the lineage trace of a data object to the federated worker.\r\nFor now, we are including only the lineage trace of matrices which come from the data gen operation (e.g. _rand()_), as they have the respective lineage item set in their _CacheableData_ objects.\r\nIn order to include the lineage trace for all matrices, we need to pass it through the _broadcast_ and _broadcastSliced_ methods to the creation of the actual PUT_VAR FederatedRequest. I decided to introduce the mechanics at first, and change the _broadcast_ methods with the next PR. This will allow for a better discussion about where to include the lineage trace, since then we can decide per instruction whether to put the lineage trace to the federated site or not.\r\nHowever, I first tried to set the _LineageItem_ into the _CacheableData_ object at every instruction, but this leads to an increase in the size of the _CacheableData_ object. Therefore, I just removed it again and changed the tests such that they have only one _LineageItem_ (from _DataGen_) in the lineage trace of the _PUT_ object for now.\r\n\r\nThanks for review :)","created_at":"2022-02-14T09:48:42Z","updated_at":"2022-03-04T18:25:03Z","closed_at":"2022-03-04T18:19:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1fd2692f0eb2d47bbd85594996c11072b8526e7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1544/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1544/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1544/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/b622804d0fb990a4fe152c8289455c90a8a2701d","head":{"label":"ywcb00:feat/fed/multitenancy/optimize/lineagebased/synclineagetransfer","ref":"feat/fed/multitenancy/optimize/lineagebased/synclineagetransfer","sha":"b622804d0fb990a4fe152c8289455c90a8a2701d","user":{"login":"ywcb00","id":52667438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjY3NDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52667438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00","html_url":"https://github.com/ywcb00","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":317657216,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTc2NTcyMTY=","name":"systemds","full_name":"ywcb00/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ywcb00","id":52667438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjY3NDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52667438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00","html_url":"https://github.com/ywcb00","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywcb00/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ywcb00/systemds","description":"Mirror

PR adds the _MultiThreadedOperator_ class as a superclass for all operators supporting multithreading. This allows us to replace the number of threads of the operator with a worker-specific amount after parsing the received instruction from the EXEC_INST request.\r\nWith this PR, we are setting the number of threads to the amount of processors available to the JVM of the federated worker whenever the operator allows for multithreading (i.e. a subclass of _MultiThreadedOperator_).\r\n\r\nThanks
