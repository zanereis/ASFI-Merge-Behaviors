this organization is in a bit more serious condition and I found a few bugs that prevented the use of this integration.\r\n\r\nThe commit https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/ac943c9e18f75259d531dbda8c51e650f57faa4c#diff-e7f34f73940eb52d92bb991abedc1c963431c5373c12dff739c8fb7d03e93d3aR181  changed the output type for the `read` method.  Unfortunately, this change did not update this handler as well, so the attempt to read the entries was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe flush method was missing, with the result that at times one or two of the last entries were not saved. It is worth adding that the official implementation of Stackdriver Logging Handler does not have this method either. https://github.com/googleapis/python-logging/blob/master/google/cloud/logging_v2/handlers/handlers.py\r\n\r\n\r\nI also changed the parameters for calling the `entries.list` method, which I have the impression that they work better. They follow the defaults for `gcloud`.\r\n\r\nClose: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/13494\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

introduced chmod a+x for installation scripts in Dockerfiles.\r\nbut this turned out to be a bad idea. This was to accomodate\r\nbuilding on Azure Deveops which has filesystem that does not\r\nkeep executable bit. But the side-effect of it that the\r\nlayer of the script is invalidated when the permission is changed\r\nto +x on linux. The problem is that the script has locally (on\r\ncheckout) different permissions depending on umask setting.\r\n\r\nTherefore changing permissions for the image to +a is not best.\r\n\r\nInstead we are running the scripts with bash directly, which does\r\nnot require changing of executable bit.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

change implements per-provider versioning tools. Version of the\r\nproviders is retrieved from provider.yaml file (top-level verion).\r\nDocumentation is generated in the documentation folder rather than\r\nin sources and embedded in provider's index. Backport providers\r\nremain as they were until we delete all the backport references in\r\nApril 2021 nd then the code can be simplified and the\r\nbackport functionality can be removed then.\r\n\r\nWhen generating multiple providers, only those that have version\r\nthat has no corresponding `providers-<PROVIDER>/<VERSION>` are\r\ngenerated. Other providers are skipped with warnings.\r\n\r\nFixes: #13272, #13271, #13274, #13276, #13277, #13275, #13273\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

production image is built for development purpose, by default\r\nit installs all providers from sources, but not all dependencies\r\nare installed for all providers. Many providers require more\r\ndependencies and when you try to import those packages via\r\nprovider's manager, they fail to import and print warnings.\r\n\r\nThose warnings are now turned into debug messages, in case\r\nAIRFLOW_INSTALLATION_METHOD=\".\", which is set when\r\nproduction image is built locally from sources. This is helpful\r\nespecially when you use locally build production image to\r\nrun K8S tests - otherwise the logs are flooded with\r\nwarnings.\r\n\r\nThis problem does not happe in CI, because there by default\r\nproduction image is built from locally prepared packages\r\nand it does not contain sources from providers that are not\r\ninstalled via packages.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR implements automated user creation for production image\r\ncontrolled by environment variables.\r\n\r\nThis is a solution for anyone who would like to make a quick test\r\nwith the production image

we are using GitHub Packages to cache images for the\r\nbuild. GitHub Packages are \"legacy\" storage of binary artifacts\r\nfor GitHub and as of September 2020 they introduced Github\r\nContainer Registry as more stable, easier to manage replacement\r\nfor container storage. It includes complete self-management\r\nof the images including permission management, public access,\r\nretention management and many more.\r\n\r\nMore about it here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.blog/2020-09-01-introducing-github-container-registry/\r\n\r\nRecently we started to experience unstable behaviour of the\r\nGithub Packages ('unknown blob' and manifest v1 vs. v2 when\r\npushing images to it. So together with ASF we proposed to\r\nenable Github Container Registry and it happened as of\r\nJanuary 2020.\r\n\r\nMore about it in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-20959\r\n\r\nWe are currently in the testing phase, especially when it\r\ncomes to management of permissions - the model of permission\r\nmangement is not the same for Container Registry as it was\r\nfor GitHub Packages (it was per-repository in GitHub Packages,\r\nbut it is organization-wide in the Container Registry.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces an option to use GitHub Container Registry\r\nrather than GitHub Packages. It is implemented in both - CI\r\nlevel and Breeze level allowing to seamlessly switch between\r\nthose two solutions:\r\n\r\nIn Breeze (which we use to test pushing/pulling the images)\r\n--github-registry option was added with `ghcr.io` (Github Container\r\nRegistry) or `docker.pkg.github.com` (GitHub Packages).\r\n\r\nIn CI the same can be achieved by setting GITHUB_REGISTRY value\r\n(same values possible as for --github-registry Breeze parameter)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

First of all, the previous version had a title that did not describe its content well.  I corrected it which will make it easier to find this page. \r\n- I have added sections that describe the requirements for the supported database versions. Previously, there was only a link to HA requirements, but no description for the basic configuration.\r\n- I have moved the sections on database URI to the top of this document as this knowledge is needed in the following sections.\r\n- I have created separate sections for MySQL and PostgreSQL because users who use MySQL are not interested in the information for PostgresSQL and vice versa. This also allowed us to delete various blocks of notes that were difficult to format and read.\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

that one of our cache images got permanently broken via\r\nmanifest v1 vs. v2 problem.\r\n\r\nThis manifests (!) itself in the way that images pushed\r\n(in this case it is docker.pkg.github.com/apache/airflow/master-python3.6-ci)\r\ngets more-or-less permanent problems with pushing new versions\r\nto it:\r\n\r\n* manifest invalid: Only schema version 2 is supported\r\n* unknown blob\r\n\r\nSuch image becomes corrupted then. When you try to push\r\nsuch image you get this error:\r\n\r\nError response from daemon: mediaType in manifest should be 'application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json' not ''\r\n\r\nThe permanent solution to the problem would be to switch to\r\nGithub Container Registry but we need Infrastructure enabling\r\nthis on a global level:\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/INFRA/issues/INFRA-20959\r\n\r\nFor now the solution is to add prefixes to the images cached\r\nin the GitHub Registry, hoping that those new images will\r\nbe more stable - until we will be able to switch to the\r\nGithub Container Registry\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
