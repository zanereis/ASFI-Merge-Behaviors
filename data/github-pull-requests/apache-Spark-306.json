What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nHashAggregateExec codegen uses two paths for fast hash table and a generic one.\nIt generates code paths for iterating over both, and both code paths generate the consume code of the parent operator, resulting in that code being expanded twice.\nThis leads to a long generated function that might be an issue for the compiler (see e.g. SPARK-21603).\nI propose to remove the double expansion by generating the consume code in a helper function that can just be called from both iterating loops.\n\nAn issue with separating the `consume` code to a helper function was that a number of places relied and assumed on being in the scope of an outside `produce` loop and e.g. use `continue` to jump out.\nI replaced such code flows with nested scopes. It is code that should be handled the same by compiler, while getting rid of depending on assumptions that are outside of the `consume`'s own scope.\n\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting test coverage.","created_at":"2017-09-22T15:40:06Z","updated_at":"2017-09-26T13:45:51Z","closed_at":"2017-09-25T19:53:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9eeefa8677691d2c810dc1706c100ca0f3ae5c70","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19324/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19324/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19324/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ca64368b369e2afa6b49e4cdcfa0a3d80704cadb","head":{"label":"juliuszsompolski:aggrconsumecodegen","ref":"aggrconsumecodegen","sha":"ca64368b369e2afa6b49e4cdcfa0a3d80704cadb","user":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82301030,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjMwMTAzMA==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request? \r\n\r\nAs described in [SPARK-22102](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22102). spark-sql shows the warehouse dir is `file:/root/create/spark/spark-2.3.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-2.6.5/spark-warehouse`, but actually the warehouse dir is `/user/hive/warehouse` when create table. the reason is that set `ConfVars.METASTOREWAREHOUSE` after constructor CliSessionState is invalid.\r\n\r\nThis PR set `ConfVars.METASTOREWAREHOUSE` before constructor CliSessionState\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmanual tests, seems didn't have a good way to do unit test.\r\n\r\n```\r\nYumings-MacBook-Pro:spark-2.3.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-2.6.5 ming$ bin/spark-sql\r\n17/09/22 21:59:59 WARN

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `percentile_approx` function previously accepted numeric type input and output double type results. \r\n\r\nBut since all numeric types, date and timestamp types are represented as numerics internally, `percentile_approx` can support them easily.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, it supports date type, timestamp type and numeric types as input types. The result type is also changed to be the same as the input type, which is more reasonable for percentiles.\r\n\r\nThis change is also required when we generate equi-height histograms for these types.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test and modified some existing tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-22T07:40:31Z","updated_at":"2017-09-25T16:51:57Z","closed_at":"2017-09-25T16:31:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"df87b42dbfc40f6057f8f51f53790365276a2329","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19321/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19321/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19321/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d59fe37c9554595557b3b03ff69c8b995f0b137f","head":{"label":"wzhfy:approx_percentile_support_types","ref":"approx_percentile_support_types","sha":"d59fe37c9554595557b3b03ff69c8b995f0b137f","user":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66051854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA1MTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"wzhfy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nNaiveBayes currently takes aggreateByKey followed by a collect to calculate frequency for each feature/label.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22096\r\n\r\nNaiveBayes currently takes aggreateByKey followed by a collect to calculate frequency for each feature/label. We can implement a new function 'aggregateByKeyLocally' in RDD that merges locally on each mapper before sending results to a reducer to save one stage.\r\nWe tested on NaiveBayes and see ~20% performance gain with these changes.\r\n\r\nThis is a subtask of our improvement.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe have to make sure that SerializerManager's private instance of\r\nkryo also uses the right classloader, regardless of the current thread\r\nclassloader.  In particular, this fixes serde during remote cache\r\nfetches, as those occur in netty threads.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual tests & existing suite via jenkins.  I haven't been able to reproduce this is in a unit test, because when a remote RDD partition can be fetched, there is a warning message and then the partition is just recomputed locally.  I manually verified the warning message is no longer present.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit

instead of having to\r\nexplicitly do it in code.\r\n\r\nThe code used by SparkContext to implement the feature was refactored into\r\na helper method in the Utils class, and SQL's ExecutionListenerManager was\r\nmodified to use it to initialize listener declared in the configuration.\r\n\r\nUnit tests were added to verify all the new functionality.","created_at":"2017-09-21T17:36:42Z","updated_at":"2017-10-13T23:15:16Z","closed_at":"2017-10-10T22:53:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b1414ab12e0497808cde125cb773e368488fa386","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19309/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19309/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19309/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bcc44e9945f29f60a307bfa3a90225d4419622de","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-19558","ref":"SPARK-19558","sha":"bcc44e9945f29f60a307bfa3a90225d4419622de","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

the spark's native rules are applied. \r\n\r\nAfter this PR, users can add custom pre-optimization rules via:\r\n`sparkSession.experimental.extraPreOptimizations = Seq(MyCustomPreOptimization)`\r\nAnd custom post-optimization rules via:\r\n`sparkSession.experimental.extraOptimizations = Seq(MyCustomPostOptimization)` \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe changes are unit tested and also locally test using spark

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21549 JIRA issue.\r\n\r\nSince version 2.2 Spark does not respect OutputFormat with no output paths provided.\r\nThe examples of such formats are [Cassandra OutputFormat](https://github.com/finn-no/cassandra-hadoop/blob/08dfa3a7ac727bb87269f27a1c82ece54e3f67e6/src/main/java/org/apache/cassandra/hadoop2/AbstractColumnFamilyOutputFormat.java), [Aerospike OutputFormat](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-hadoop/blob/master/mapreduce/src/main/java/com/aerospike/hadoop/mapreduce/AerospikeOutputFormat.java), etc. which do not have an ability to rollback the results written to an external systems on job failure. \r\n\r\nProvided output directory is required by Spark to allows files to be committed to an absolute output location, that is not the case for output formats which write data to external systems.\r\n\r\nThis pull request prevents accessing `absPathStagingDir` method that causes the error described in SPARK-21549 unless there are files to rename in `addedAbsPathFiles`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-20T13:28:09Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T03:47:27Z","closed_at":"2017-10-07T03:46:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cd25c01888a6c6c04c19fc918a88fa9d5a45d033","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19294/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19294/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19294/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f55b7c2e14ea9cb49255359b294e6d275cda4380","head":{"label":"szhem:SPARK-21549-abs-output-commits","ref":"SPARK-21549-abs-output-commits","sha":"f55b7c2e14ea9cb49255359b294e6d275cda4380","user":{"login":"szhem","id":1523889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjM4ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1523889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem","html_url":"https://github.com/szhem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":89217073,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4OTIxNzA3Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"szhem/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"szhem","id":1523889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjM4ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1523889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem","html_url":"https://github.com/szhem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szhem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/szhem/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, we set lintr to jimhester/lintr@a769c0b (see [this](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/7d1175011c976756efcd4e4e4f70a8fd6f287026) and [SPARK-14074](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14074)).\r\n\r\nI first tested and checked lintr-1.0.1 but it looks many important fixes are missing (for example, checking 100 length). So, I instead tried the latest commit, https://github.com/jimhester/lintr/commit/5431140ffea65071f1327625d4a8de9688fa7e72, in my local and fixed the check failures.\r\n\r\nIt looks it has fixed many bugs and now finds many instances that I have observed and thought should be caught time to time, here I filed [the results](https://gist.github.com/HyukjinKwon/4f59ddcc7b6487a02da81800baca533c).\r\n\r\nThe downside looks it now takes about 7ish mins, (it was 2ish mins before) in my local.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually, `./dev/lint-r` after manually updating the lintr package.","created_at":"2017-09-20T09:25:22Z","updated_at":"2018-01-10T03:29:59Z","closed_at":"2017-10-01T09:45:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"30e89ee302f25338c798a864923983d25eeab520","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19290/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19290/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19290/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/550750eb264d5143007e4e9327dc250643af0f84","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:upgrade-r-lint","ref":"upgrade-r-lint","sha":"550750eb264d5143007e4e9327dc250643af0f84","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRight now the calculation of SortMergeJoinExec's outputOrdering relies on the fact that its children have already been sorted on the join keys, while this is often not true until EnsureRequirements has been applied. So we ended up not getting the correct outputOrdering during physical planning stage before Sort nodes are added to the children.\r\n\r\nFor example, J = {A join B on key1 = key2}\r\n1. if A is NOT ordered on key1 ASC, J's outputOrdering should include \"key1 ASC\"\r\n2. if A is ordered on key1 ASC, J's outputOrdering should include \"key1 ASC\"\r\n3. if A is ordered on key1 ASC, with sameOrderExp=c1, J's outputOrdering should include \"key1 ASC, sameOrderExp=c1\"\r\n\r\nSo to fix this I changed the  behavior of <code>getKeyOrdering(keys, childOutputOrdering)</code> to:\r\n1. If the childOutputOrdering satisfies (is a superset of) the required child ordering => childOutputOrdering\r\n2. Otherwise => required child ordering\r\n\r\nIn addition, I organized the logic for deciding the relationship between two orderings into SparkPlan, so that it can be reused by EnsureRequirements and SortMergeJoinExec, and potentially other classes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new test cases.\r\nPassed all integration tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-19T18:53:16Z","updated_at":"2017-09-22T06:56:58Z","closed_at":"2017-09-22T06:56:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"39ad2264e7a7a986e39798e9db677a1877243421","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19281/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19281/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19281/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/78f41e046ea4e307e43315b23ed3212e1f4c3f1b","head":{"label":"maryannxue:spark-21998","ref":"spark-21998","sha":"78f41e046ea4e307e43315b23ed3212e1f4c3f1b","user":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104110775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxMTA3NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"maryannxue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe have to make sure that SerializerManager's private instance of\r\nkryo also uses the right classloader, regardless of the current thread\r\nclassloader.  In particular, this fixes serde during remote cache\r\nfetches, as those occur in netty threads.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual tests & existing suite via jenkins.  I haven't been able to reproduce this is in a unit test, because when a remote RDD partition can be fetched, there is a warning message and then the partition is just recomputed locally.  I manually verified the warning message is no longer present.","created_at":"2017-09-19T18:15:59Z","updated_at":"2017-09-25T20:57:54Z","closed_at":"2017-09-21T17:23:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3c4df4bc0951cb2b30c9a9a934de9bd8ce5c489","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19280/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19280/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19280/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/20e3585eac16ef3bfe403ec23f57a2705ff47ecb","head":{"label":"squito:SPARK-21928_ser_classloader","ref":"SPARK-21928_ser_classloader","sha":"20e3585eac16ef3bfe403ec23f57a2705ff47ecb","user":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29212749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTIxMjc0OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"squito/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/squito/spark","description":"Mirror

Issue：https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22056\r\n\r\nWhen spark streaming consuming data from Kafka in direct way , partition in Kafka and KafkaRDDPartition in spark streaming are now bijection. To enhance the computing ability of spark streaming, we always to increase the number of partitions in Kafka , but too many increments may lead problems in Kafka like leader selection. \r\nSo , we introduce a new mechanism that change bijection to one-to-many which controls by a new parameter named \"topic.partition.subconcurrency\". This mechanism will divide one KafkaRDDPartition to many according to the parameter in spark streaming side , thus will make spark streaming use computing resources more efficient  and avoid the problems caused by increasing the Kafka partitions.  \r\n\r\nwe test this in production , the processing capacity of spark streaming improves apparently.\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-19T08:29:19Z","updated_at":"2018-07-19T02:52:09Z","closed_at":"2018-07-19T02:52:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5804b1327a4c388985a2ba1308a79172ff568da4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19274/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19274/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19274/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d1132195d6b2087be4f18ad25614836c46512fe7","head":{"label":"fhan688:add_partition_concurrency","ref":"add_partition_concurrency","sha":"d1132195d6b2087be4f18ad25614836c46512fe7","user":{"login":"fhan688","id":5745228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDUyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5745228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688","html_url":"https://github.com/fhan688","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":102328495,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDIzMjg0OTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"fhan688/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fhan688","id":5745228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDUyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5745228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688","html_url":"https://github.com/fhan688","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fhan688/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\ntl;dr: Add a class, `MesosHadoopDelegationTokenManager` that updates delegation tokens on a schedule on the behalf of Spark Drivers. Broadcast renewed credentials to the executors.\r\n\r\n## The problem\r\nWe recently added Kerberos support to Mesos-based Spark jobs as well as Secrets support to the Mesos Dispatcher (SPARK-16742, SPARK-20812, respectively). However the delegation tokens have a defined expiration. This poses a problem for long running Spark jobs (e.g. Spark Streaming applications). YARN has a solution for this where a thread is scheduled to renew the tokens they reach 75% of their way to expiration. It then writes the tokens to HDFS for the executors to find (uses a monotonically increasing suffix). \r\n\r\n## This solution\r\nWe replace the current method in `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` which used to discard the token renewal time with a protected method `fetchHadoopDelegationTokens`. Now the individual cluster backends are responsible for overriding this method to fetch and manage token renewal. The delegation tokens themselves, are still part of the `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` as before. \r\nIn the case of Mesos renewed Credentials are broadcasted to the executors. This maintains all transfer of Credentials within Spark (as opposed to Spark-to-HDFS). It also does not require any writing of Credentials to disk. It also does not require any GC of old files. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually against a Kerberized HDFS cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for the reviews.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n#### Architecture\r\nThis PR implements stream-stream inner join using a two-way symmetric hash join. At a high level, we want to do the following.\r\n\r\n1. For each stream, we maintain the past rows as state in State Store.\r\n  - For each joining key, there can be multiple rows that have been received.\r\n  - So, we have to effectively maintain a key-to-list-of-values multimap as state for each stream.\r\n2. In each batch, for each input row in each stream\r\n  - Look up the other streams state to see if there are matching rows, and output them if they satisfy the joining condition\r\n  - Add the input row to corresponding stream’s state.\r\n  - If the data has a timestamp/window column with watermark, then we will use that to calculate the threshold for keys that are required to buffered for future matches and drop the rest from the state.\r\n\r\nCleaning up old unnecessary state rows depends completely on whether watermark has been defined and what are join conditions. We definitely want to support state clean up two types of queries that are likely to be common.\r\n\r\n- Queries to time range conditions - E.g. `SELECT * FROM leftTable, rightTable ON leftKey = rightKey AND leftTime > rightTime - INTERVAL 8 MINUTES AND leftTime < rightTime + INTERVAL 1 HOUR`\r\n- Queries with windows as the matching key - E.g. `SELECT * FROM leftTable, rightTable ON leftKey = rightKey AND window(leftTime, \"1 hour\") = window(rightTime, \"1 hour\")` (pseudo-SQL)\r\n\r\n#### Implementation \r\nThe stream-stream join is primarily implemented in three classes\r\n- `StreamingSymmetricHashJoinExec` implements the above symmetric join algorithm.\r\n- `SymmetricsHashJoinStateManagers` manages the streaming state for the join. This essentially is a fault-tolerant key-to-list-of-values multimap built on the StateStore APIs. `StreamingSymmetricHashJoinExec` instantiates two such managers, one for each join side.\r\n- `StreamingSymmetricHashJoinExecHelper` is a helper class to extract threshold for the state based on the join conditions and the event watermark.\r\n\r\nRefer to the scaladocs class for more implementation details.\r\n\r\nBesides the implementation of stream-stream inner join SparkPlan. Some additional changes are\r\n- Allowed inner join in append mode in UnsupportedOperationChecker\r\n- Prevented stream-stream join on an empty batch dataframe to be collapsed by the optimizer\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n- New tests in StreamingJoinSuite\r\n- Updated tests UnsupportedOperationSuite\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-18T23:46:47Z","updated_at":"2017-09-21T22:41:55Z","closed_at":"2017-09-21T22:41:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"076977d5a87440757390bcec5c4c5f435f2363e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19271/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19271/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19271/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d8116d0577bba516320c976debba9eb708fe2ce2","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-22053","ref":"SPARK-22053","sha":"d8116d0577bba516320c976debba9eb708fe2ce2","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

column sort and search for Stage Page using jQuery DataTable and REST API. Before this commit, the Stage page generated a hard-coded HTML table that could not support search. Supporting search and sort (over all applications rather than the 20 entries in the current page) in any case will greatly improve the user experience.\r\nCreated the stagespage-template.html for displaying application information in datables. Added REST api endpoint and javascript code to fetch data from the endpoint and display it on the data table.\r\nBecause of the above change, certain functionalities in the page had to be modified to support the addition of datatables. For example, the toggle checkbox 'Select All' previously would add the checked fields as columns in the Task table and as rows in the Summary Metrics table, but after the change, only columns are added in the Task Table as it got tricky to add rows dynamically in the datatables.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nI have attached the screenshots of the Stage Page UI before and after the fix.\r\n**Before:**\r\n<img width=\"1419\" alt=\"screen shot-before\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22228190/30564304-35991e1c-9c8a-11e7-850f-2ac7a347f600.png\">\r\n\r\nAccumulators

What changes were proposed in this pull request? \r\nDynamic cluster configurations where cluster nodes are added and removed frequently are common in public cloud environments, so this has become a [problem for Spark users](https://www.trulia.com/blog/tech/aws-emr-ad-hoc-spark-development-environme... ). To cope with this we propose implementing a mechanism in the line of YARN’s support for [graceful node decommission](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-914 ) or [Mesos maintenance primitives](https://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/maintenance/ ). These changes allow cluster nodes to be transitioned to a ‘decommissioning’ state, at which point no more tasks will be scheduled on the executors running on those nodes. After a configurable drain time, nodes in the ‘decommissioning’ state will transition to a ‘decommissioned’ state, where shuffle blocks are not available anymore. Shuffle blocks stored on nodes in the ‘decommissioning’ state are available to other executors. By preventing more tasks from running on nodes in the ‘decommissioning’ state we avoid creating more shuffle blocks on those nodes, as those blocks won’t be available when nodes eventually transition to the ‘decommissioned’ state. \r\n\r\nWe have implemented a first version of this proposal for YARN, using Spark’s [blacklisting mechanism for task scheduling](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-8425 ) ─available at the node level since Spark 2.2.0─ to ensure tasks are not scheduled on nodes in the ‘decommissioning’ state. With this solution it is the cluster manager, not the Spark application, that tracks the status of the node, and handles the transition from ‘decommissioning’ to ‘decommissioned’. The Spark driver simply reacts to the node state transitions. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested? \r\nAll functionality has been tested with unit tests, with an integration test based on the BaseYarnClusterSuite, and with manual testing on a cluster

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSee jira description for the bug : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22042\r\n\r\nFix done in this PR is:  In `EnsureRequirements`, apply `ReorderJoinPredicates` over the input tree before doing its core logic. Since the tree is transformed bottom-up, we can assure that the children are resolved before doing `ReorderJoinPredicates`. \r\n\r\nTheoretically this will guarantee to cover all such cases while keeping the code simple. My small grudge is for cosmetic reasons. This PR will look weird given that we don't call rules from other rules (not to my knowledge). I could have moved all the logic for `ReorderJoinPredicates` into `EnsureRequirements` but that will make it a but crowded. I am happy to discuss if there are better options. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTables in the catalog cache are not invalidated once their statistics are updated. As a consequence, existing sessions will use the cached information even though it is not valid anymore. Consider and an example below. \r\n\r\n```\r\n// step 1\r\nspark.range(100).write.saveAsTable(\"tab1\")\r\n// step 2\r\nspark.sql(\"analyze table tab1 compute statistics\")\r\n// step 3\r\nspark.sql(\"explain cost select distinct * from tab1\").show(false)\r\n// step 4\r\nspark.range(100).write.mode(\"append\").saveAsTable(\"tab1\")\r\n// step 5\r\nspark.sql(\"explain cost select distinct * from tab1\").show(false)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter step 3, the table will be present in the catalog relation cache. Step 4 will correctly update the metadata inside the catalog but will NOT invalidate the cache.\r\n\r\nBy the way, ``spark.sql(\"analyze table tab1 compute statistics\")`` between step 3 and step 4 would also solve the problem.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCurrent and additional unit tests.","created_at":"2017-09-16T12:18:07Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T21:21:59Z","closed_at":"2017-09-19T21:21:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2081053698aee8b6a339c6e1e17007968672d974","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19252/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19252/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19252/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/63f9dc23f781bdf6e8c891e1a502b91ccdbc0281","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:spark-21969","ref":"spark-21969","sha":"63f9dc23f781bdf6e8c891e1a502b91ccdbc0281","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, assume there will be the same number of rows as child has.  statistics `logicalPlan.stats.SizeInBytes` is calculated based on the percentage of the size of the child's data type and the size of the current data type size.   But there is a problem. Statistics are not very accurate. for example:\r\n ```\r\nval N = 1 << 3\r\nval df = spark.range(N).selectExpr(\"id as k1\",\r\n      \"cast(id  % 3 as string) as idString1\",\r\n      \"cast((id + 1) % 5 as string) as idString3\")\r\nval sizeInBytes = df.logicalPlan.stats.sizeInBytes\r\nprintln(\"sizeInBytes : \" + sizeInBytes)\r\n```\r\nbefore modify：\r\nsizeInBytes is 224(8 * 8 * ( (8 + 20 + 20 +8) / (8 + 8))).  \r\ndebug information in ` SizeInBytesOnlyStatsPlanVisitor.visitUnaryNode `\r\n```\r\np.child.dataType: LongType defaultSize: 8\r\np.dataType: LongType defaultSize: 8\r\np.dataType: StringType defaultSize: 20\r\np.dataType: StringType defaultSize: 20\r\nchildRowSize: 16 outputRowSize: 56\r\np.child.stats.sizeInBytes : 64\r\np.stats.sizeInBytes : 224\r\nsizeInBytes: 224\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter modify:\r\nsizeInBytes  is 384( 8 * 8 ((8 + 20 + 20) / 8) ).\r\ndebug information in ` SizeInBytesOnlyStatsPlanVisitor.visitUnaryNode `\r\n```\r\np.child.dataType: LongType defaultSize: 8\r\np.dataType: LongType defaultSize: 8\r\np.dataType: StringType defaultSize: 20\r\np.dataType: StringType defaultSize: 20\r\nchildRowSize: 8 outputRowSize: 48\r\np.child.stats.sizeInBytes : 64\r\np.stats.sizeInBytes : 384\r\nsizeInBytes: 384\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis PR fix it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadd new test cases.\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-16T10:49:51Z","updated_at":"2017-10-09T05:41:03Z","closed_at":"2017-10-09T05:40:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ec7ea6c6f8bb436af9264ecc860c5fdd60dd9218","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19251/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19251/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19251/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7f89db1e4c97a26058d4269bd3627c10a30a177b","head":{"label":"heary-cao:sizeInBytes","ref":"sizeInBytes","sha":"7f89db1e4c97a26058d4269bd3627c10a30a177b","user":{"login":"heary-cao","id":20164092,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTY0MDky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20164092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao","html_url":"https://github.com/heary-cao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":76841445,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3Njg0MTQ0NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"heary-cao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"heary-cao","id":20164092,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTY0MDky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20164092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao","html_url":"https://github.com/heary-cao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heary-cao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/heary-cao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen reading and writing data, spark will adjust timestamp data based on the delta between the current session timezone and the table time zone (specified either by a persistent table property, or an option to the DataFrameReader / Writer).  This is particularly important for parquet data, so that it can be treated equivalently by other SQL engines (eg. Impala and Hive).  Furthermore, this is useful if the same data is processed by multiple clusters in different time zones, and \"timestamp without time zone\" semantics are desired.\r\n\r\nDesign doc:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIf there are two projects like as follows.\r\n```\r\nProject [a_with_metadata#27 AS b#26]\r\n+- Project [a#0 AS a_with_metadata#27]\r\n   +- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#0, b#1]\r\n```\r\nChild Project has an output column with a metadata in it, and the parent Project has an alias that implicitly forwards the metadata. So this metadata is visible for higher operators. Upon applying CollapseProject optimizer rule, the metadata is not preserved.\r\n```\r\nProject [a#0 AS b#26]\r\n+- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#0, b#1]\r\n```\r\nThis is incorrect, as downstream operators that expect certain metadata (e.g. watermark in structured streaming) to identify certain fields will fail to do so. This PR fixes it by preserving the metadata of top-level aliases.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit

SparkStreaming DRA .The metric we use to add or remove executor is the ratio of batch processing time / batch duration (R). And we use the parameter \"spark.streaming.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors\" to set the max Num of executor .Currently it doesn't work well with Spark streaming because of several reasons:\r\n(1) For example if the max nums of executor we need is 10 and we set \"spark.streaming.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors\" to 15,Obviously ，We wasted 5 executors.\r\n(2) If the number of topic partition changes ，then the partition of KafkaRDD or the num of tasks in a stage changes too.And the max executor we need will also change,so the num of maxExecutors should change with the nums of Task .\r\nThe goal of this JIRA is to auto fix maxNumExecutors . Using a SparkListerner when Stage Submitted ,first figure out the num executor we need , then update the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-21690 makes one-pass `Imputer` by parallelizing the computation of all input columns. When we transform dataset with `ImputerModel`, we do `withColumn` on all input columns sequentially. We can also do this on all input columns at once by adding a `withColumns` API to `Dataset`.\r\n\r\nThe new `withColumns` API is for internal use only now.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests for `ImputerModel`'s change. Added tests for `withColumns` API.\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-14T04:10:05Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:21:04Z","closed_at":"2017-10-01T17:51:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d0f909aeb8a610962b14f69c1413a3b42a5298b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19229/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19229/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19229/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1292ce01ccf24eb40638e748a9cb0b0dbabbb72c","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-22001","ref":"SPARK-22001","sha":"1292ce01ccf24eb40638e748a9cb0b0dbabbb72c","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR leverages the facility of SPARK-16742 to support accessing security Hadoop cluster in standalone client mode. The key idea is brought from SPARK-16742, add a simple logics to support `HadoopDelegationTokenManager` in `StandaloneSchedulerBackend`. Besides this PR also address related docs/configuration issue:\r\n\r\n1. Rename \"spark.yarn.principal\", \"spark.yarn.keytab\" to \"spark.security.principal\" and \"spark.security.keytab\", since principal/keytab is not only used in yarn mode, so rename it to be more meaningful.\r\n2. Move the related docs from `running-on-yarn` page to `security` page, since it is not a yarn only feature.\r\n3.
