is a slightly modified and rearranged version of @reuvenlax 's #2647 .\r\n\r\nMy concerns about it are:\r\n\r\n1) In direct runner, the integration tests of dynamic sharding are vacuous, because direct runner replaces unspecified sharding with fixed sharding at https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/runners/direct-java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/direct/WriteWithShardingFactory.java (applied at https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/runners/direct-java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/direct/DirectRunner.java#L217). However, this is a testing-only concern: other runners don't have this override, so overall the testing is non-vacuous, this is just hard to test against direct runner and I suspect that we probably want these tests to be non-vacuous in direct runner too.\r\n\r\n2) When I removed that override for testing purposes, I noticed that there's a very large number of files being written - primarily, I guess, because the bundles are very small. So large a number of files that the test time for batch with dynamic sharding grows from 21 seconds to 5 minutes. In particular, we write many, many files for each window/pane - presumably because in streaming runners and in direct runner, there's at least 1 bundle per key, and we create at least 1 file per bundle in WriteFiles.Write(Windowed,Unwindowed)Bundles.\r\n\r\nReuven, can you please comment on whether this \"at least 1 file per key\" is expected behavior in a streaming runner? I suspect that it's not, but then I'm not sure how to fix the PR semantically.\r\n\r\nCC: @reuvenlax @davorbonaci @dhalperi

sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\r\nquickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\r\n   `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\r\n - [ ] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`.\r\n - [ ] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\r\n       number, if there is one.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\r\n       [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe have cascading failures:\r\n\r\n - All runners were included together in the `include-runners` profile in the Java 8 examples\r\n - `TestOptions` has a hard dep on hamcrest that we list as `provided`, putting a burden on users\r\n - `TestSparkPipelineOptions` was registered, so the Spark runner had this same hard dep and class load time\r\n - If you do `options.as(MyUnregisteredOptions.class)` this will cause `TestPipeline`/`PipelineOptionsFactory` to crash with a parse error even if none of the unregistered options were present\r\n\r\nThese should all be fixed, IMO as follows:\r\n\r\n - Runners should have separate profiles (done in this PR)\r\n - `TestOptions` should either not use hamcrest or should declare a correct dependency (not resolved)\r\n - `TestSparkPipelineOptions` should either not need to be registered or should be allowed to be registered (expected resolution: no need to register)\r\n - `TestPipeline` / `PipelineOptionsFactory` should not crash due to how options have been observed, when they are not mutated, and probably should just not crash at
