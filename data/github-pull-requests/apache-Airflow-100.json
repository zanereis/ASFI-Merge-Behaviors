allows @task decorated functions to be called directly, so that e.g. unit tests keep on working for defined functions. Context from a task or a dag is unavailable when a function is called like this.\r\n\r\nWhy is this relevant?\r\n\r\nFor example: data scientists typically define their models in a kind of notebook interface. Currently, if they start decorating their functions with `@task` any tests or function calls will seize to work as XComArg are returned and the function is not executed. This requires to run the full workflow through `dag.test()` which cannot be executed incrementally and interferes with the notebook style of working.\r\n\r\nWith this change decorated tasks behave the same as undecorated tasks when being called without a DAG context. This allows mixing non-dag code and dag code together simplifying collaboration between data engineering and data science a.o.\r\n\r\nNote: I'm aware that tests fail, this is to gather feedback on the approach and the change\r\n\r\n@dimberman @potiuk @ashb

system tests `example_eks_with_fargate_in_one_step` and `example_eks_with_fargate_profile` are failing for the same reason. When the operator `EksPodOperator` is used with `get_logs=True`, the operator tries to get log once the POD started. When doing so, 90% of the time it fails because of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHTTP response body: b'{\"kind\":\"Status\",\"apiVersion\":\"v1\",\"metadata\":{},\"status\":\"Failure\",\"message\":\"Get \\\\\"https://10.0.5.84:10250/containerLogs/default/run-pod-6rjxgqrs/base?follow=true\\\\u0026timestamps=true\\\\\": remote error: tls: internal error\",\"code\":500}\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter investigation, it turns out there is delay between when the pod starts and when the [CSR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cert-signing.html) is available, signed and approved. If you try to get logs with the command `kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>` when the CSR is not available, signed and approved, you'll get the exact same error. If you wait until the CSR is there, you'll get the logs.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to fix it, I decided to just retry on `ApiException` which the is the exception we get in such scenario.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

when deploying multiple releases that share the same release name in **different** namespaces deployment is failing due to a naming clash of the cluster-scoped RBAC resources.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces changes that make sure that `ClusterRole`s and `ClusterRoleBinding`s are uniquely named according to both the release name, as well as the release namespace, thus solving the naming clash.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce current behavior:\r\n1. Create namespace `airflow-a`\r\n2. Install helm chart release named `airflow` into namespace `airflow-a` with `multiNamespaceMode: true`\r\n3. Create namespace `airflow-b`\r\n4. Install helm chart release named `airflow` into namespace `airflow-b` with `multiNamespaceMode: true`\r\n5. Installing the helm chart will fail due to a naming clash of the cluster-wide RBAC resources\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR adds a `gcp_credential_config_file` `backend_kwargs` option to Google Secrets Manager's secret backend implementation that allows the secrets backend to authenticate to the secrets manager service using a [credential configuration file](https://google.aip.dev/auth/4117). This is usually used to support workload identity federation use cases by providing external credentials, but it also supports a wide range of credential types:\r\n- `authorized_user`\r\n- `service_account`\r\n- `external_account`\r\n- `external_account_authorized_user`\r\n- `impersonated_service_account`\r\n- `gdch_service_account`\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up PR to

AIP-50 Project\r\nrelated: #31301\r\n\r\nThis PR implements Part 2 of AIP-50 and once merged closes the AIP-50 improvement.\r\n\r\nIn this PR the behavior of the Trigger Button is changed to Option B as discussed in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-50+Trigger+DAG+UI+Extension+with+Flexible+User+Form+Concept and voted in https://lists.apache.org/thread/4dkbwob1wyl3xjbqdsmbd1mvgzflzp1f\r\n\r\nChanges in this PR:\r\n* Trigger button will route to the Trigger UI form only if DAG has parameters, else it skips form display\r\n* Headline in trigger UI form adds a link back to DAG (I was strongly missing a way back :-D))\r\n* Route/endpoint of trigger UI was made consistent to other routes in DAG\r\n\r\nNote: This code touches also parts from PR #31301 - PR #31301 should be merged and this revised before merge\r\n\r\nHow to test?\r\n* Start the Web UI and click on the \"Trigger DAG\" button in the DAG

commit updates the sqlalchemy queries to adopt the 2.0 query style,\r\nwhich is compatible with version 1.4. The changes involve updating the engine\r\nwith the future=True flag to indicate the execution of queries using the 2.0 style.\r\nAs a result, textual SQL statements are wrapped with the text function.\r\n\r\nIn addition, queries that previously used delete and update operations have been\r\nmodified to utilize the new delete/update construct. Furthermore, all queries within the\r\njobs/ and api/ directories have been thoroughly updated to employ the new style queries.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this commit intentionally stops at this point to

Apprise Provider, which is a module to send notifications to a bunch of services like - \r\n1. [Microsoft Teams](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/Notify_msteams)\r\n2. [Twitter](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/Notify_twitter)\r\n3. [Reddit](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/Notify_reddit)\r\n\r\nThe entire list of supported services can be found [here](https://github.com/caronc/apprise#supported-notifications)\r\n\r\nThis provider is especially helpful in scenarios where Airflow doesn't have a provider for service and you want to send notifications to that service. Like MS Teams at the moment, to send notifications to MS teams we would just need to create the apprise connection with the right value for the config field example, which you can get by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/Notify_msteams) \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"path\": \"https://team-name.office.com/webhook/abcdefgf8-2f4b-4eca-8f61-225c83db1967@abcdefg2-5a99-4849-8efc-c9e78d28e57d/IncomingWebhook/291289f63a8abd3593e834af4d79f9fe/a2329f43-0ffb-46ab-948b-c9abdad9d643\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in your DAG you can do something like this - \r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator\r\nfrom airflow.providers.apprise.notifications.apprise import send_apprise_notification\r\nfrom apprise import NotifyType\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"apprise_notifier_testing\",\r\n    schedule_interval=None,\r\n    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n    on_success_callback=[\r\n        send_apprise_notification(apprise_conn_id=\"apprise_conn\", body=\"The dag {{ dag.dag_id }} failed\", notify_type=NotifyType.FAILURE)\r\n    ],\r\n):\r\n    BashOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"mytask\",\r\n        on_failure_callback=[\r\n            send_apprise_notification(apprise_conn_id=\"apprise_conn\", body=\"The task {{ ti.task_id }} failed\", notify_type=NotifyType.FAILURE)\r\n        ],\r\n        bash_command=\"fail\",\r\n

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/27755 introduced sending triggerer health status in the `/api/v1/health` \r\nendpoint and also updated relevant docs but we have the primary `/health` \r\nendpoint too which is missing this information. The PR addresses this missing \r\nstatus report for triggerer health in the `/health` endpoint. It also attempts to \r\ndeduplicate the code between those endpoints so that in future when we need \r\nto make necessary changes in only one place and at the same time ensure that \r\nchange made in one endpoint is not missed for the other endpoint serving the \r\nsame purpose and thus ensuring consistency in the responses.\r\n\r\nfixes: #31522\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR adds the ability to start BeamRunPythonOperator asynchronously using deferrable mode. The documentation was updated with the description of how to work with **deferrable** parameter.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the existing implementation was fixed:\r\n- for the BeamRunPythonOperator unused call of *dataflow_hook.wait_for_done* was removed, since the waiting process for the pipeline to be successfully finished was covered by the *beam_hook.start_python_pipeline* itself: this method creates the process to execute command in Apache Beam and waits for its end of execution in parallel with outputting logs. The same approach was used while implementing deferrable mode for the Operator, but using asynchronous calls.\r\n- version of Apache-beam package in system tests was updated\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

the last wave of providers #31416 we bumped min-airlfow-version to 2.4 and added mechanism to verify min-airflow version is ok while importing, but it turned out that there are cases where installing just old version of airflow (with no constraints) brings the latest version of those providers and causes new installation of airflow to fail. This is far too common to ignore or require to use constraints, unfortunately  We do not have min-airlfow-version in the preinstalled providers for one reason only. For some tools that are NOT conforming to standards (such as bazel), having min-airflow-version for those providers causes circular dependency (even though technically dependencies in PyPI can - and often are - circular, because dependencies in Python are not DAG and can contain cycles.\r\n\r\nThis was in response to this issue in 2021 #17795.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is really  bazel issue, and on top of it - it's recognized as such and being fixed very recently\r\nin https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1188 because there are other packages that have similar problems (pytorch and triton being popular couple). Also Bazel is not that popular in the Python world. \r\n\r\nTherefore, rather than trying to workaround the problem of bazel, we encourage them to merge and release the fix\r\nhttps://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/pull/1166#issuecomment-1558690218 and call it out in our installation instructions, that bazel installation might lead to problems like that.\r\n\r\nIf bazel does not fix it, this will only be a problem for Future installations of airflow in a few months most likely. It will not impact current bazel users installing old versions of Airflow (actually they might start having problems now if we do not fix it and yank the 5 providers released yesterday)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
