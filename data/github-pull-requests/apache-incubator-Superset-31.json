There are lots of new helpers in d3-array, too, such as <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-least\">d3.greatest</a>, <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>passes events directly to listeners</strong>, replacing the d3.event global and bringing D3 inline with vanilla JavaScript and most other frameworks.</p>\n<p><strong>d3-delaunay</strong> (based on Vladimir Agafonkin’s excellent <a href=\"https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator\">Delaunator</a>) replaces d3-voronoi, offering dramatic improvements to performance, robustness, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/delaunay-find\">search</a>. And there’s a new <a href=\"https://github.com/Fil/d3-geo-voronoi\">d3-geo-voronoi</a> for spherical (geographical) data! <strong>d3-random</strong> is <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md\">greatly expanded</a> and includes a fast <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-randomlcg\">linear congruential generator</a> for seeded randomness. <strong>d3-chord</strong> has new layouts for <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/directed-chord-diagram\">directed</a> and transposed chord diagrams. <strong>d3-scale</strong> adds a new <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-stacked-bar-chart-ii\">radial scale</a> type.</p>\n<p>… and a variety of other small enhancements. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery\">More than 450 examples</a> have been updated to D3 6.0!</p>\n<h3>d3-array</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Accept iterables.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#group\">d3.group</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#groups\">d3.groups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#index\">d3.index</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#indexes\">d3.indexes</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollup\">d3.rollup</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollups\">d3.rollups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#maxIndex\">d3.maxIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#minIndex\">d3.minIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatest\">d3.greatest</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatestIndex\">d3.greatestIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#least\">d3.least</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#leastIndex\">d3.leastIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#count\">d3.count</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cumsum\">d3.cumsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#Adder\">d3.Adder</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quantileSorted\">d3.quantileSorted</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bisector_center\"><em>bisector</em>.center</a>.</li>\n<li>Allow more than two iterables for <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cross\">d3.cross</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nClickable UI elements lacking `<a>` or `<button>` tags, or the `role=\"button\"` attribute, weren't semantically clear as clickable elements when using a screen reader. \r\n\r\nTo improve accessibility, I reviewed the React codebase for `onClick` handlers. When encountering HTML elements with `onClick` handlers AND without `<a>` or `<button>` tags, I added the `role=\"button\"` attribute to identify them as clickable. \r\n\r\nThis approach targets the most immediate and straightforward cases, ensuring that elements triggered by onClick handlers are now clearly identified as clickable for users relying on screen readers. \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nTesting options include:\r\n- Using a screen reader: identify and navigate through the clickable components and ensure they are announced correctly \r\n- Using browser devtools: inspect clickable elements and verify that elements without `<a>` or `<button>` tags have the `role=\"button\"` attribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

For minor and patch changes, please see the <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3/releases\">release notes</a>.</em></p>\n<p>D3 now ships as pure ES modules and requires Node.js 12 or higher. For more, please read <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c\">Sindre Sorhus’s FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a> now ignores nulls. <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#ascending\">d3.ascending</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#descending\">d3.descending</a> no longer consider null comparable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/main/README.md#ordinal-scales\">Ordinal scales</a> now use <a href=\"https://github.com/mbostock/internmap\">InternMap</a> for domains; domain values are now uniqued by coercing to a primitive value via <em>object</em>.valueOf instead of coercing to a string via <em>object</em>.toString.</p>\n<p>Array-likes (<em>e.g.</em>, a live NodeList such as <em>element</em>.childNodes) are converted to arrays in <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/main/README.md#selectAll\">d3.selectAll</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/main/README.md#selection_selectAll\"><em>selection</em>.selectAll</a>.</p>\n<h1>Changes in D3 6.0</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/tag/v6.0.0\">Released August 26, 2020.</a></p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>uses native collections</strong> (Map and Set) and <strong>accepts iterables</strong>. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-group\">d3.group and d3.rollup</a> are powerful new aggregation functions that replace d3.nest and work great <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/d/9a453665f405eebf\">with d3-hierarchy</a> and d3-selection. There are lots of new helpers in d3-array, too, such as <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-least\">d3.greatest</a>, <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>passes events directly to listeners</strong>, replacing the d3.event global and bringing D3 inline with vanilla JavaScript and most other frameworks.</p>\n<p><strong>d3-delaunay</strong> (based on Vladimir Agafonkin’s excellent <a href=\"https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator\">Delaunator</a>) replaces d3-voronoi, offering dramatic improvements to performance, robustness, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/delaunay-find\">search</a>. And there’s a new <a href=\"https://github.com/Fil/d3-geo-voronoi\">d3-geo-voronoi</a> for spherical (geographical) data! <strong>d3-random</strong> is <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md\">greatly expanded</a> and includes a fast <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-randomlcg\">linear congruential generator</a> for seeded randomness. <strong>d3-chord</strong> has new layouts for <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/directed-chord-diagram\">directed</a> and transposed chord diagrams. <strong>d3-scale</strong> adds a new <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-stacked-bar-chart-ii\">radial scale</a> type.</p>\n<p>… and a variety of other small enhancements. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery\">More than 450 examples</a> have been updated to D3 6.0!</p>\n<h3>d3-array</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Accept iterables.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#group\">d3.group</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#groups\">d3.groups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#index\">d3.index</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#indexes\">d3.indexes</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollup\">d3.rollup</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollups\">d3.rollups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#maxIndex\">d3.maxIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#minIndex\">d3.minIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatest\">d3.greatest</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatestIndex\">d3.greatestIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#least\">d3.least</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#leastIndex\">d3.leastIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#count\">d3.count</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cumsum\">d3.cumsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#Adder\">d3.Adder</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quantileSorted\">d3.quantileSorted</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bisector_center\"><em>bisector</em>.center</a>.</li>\n<li>Allow more than two iterables for <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cross\">d3.cross</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

For minor and patch changes, please see the <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3/releases\">release notes</a>.</em></p>\n<p>D3 now ships as pure ES modules and requires Node.js 12 or higher. For more, please read <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c\">Sindre Sorhus’s FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a> now ignores nulls. <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#ascending\">d3.ascending</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#descending\">d3.descending</a> no longer consider null comparable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/main/README.md#ordinal-scales\">Ordinal scales</a> now use <a href=\"https://github.com/mbostock/internmap\">InternMap</a> for domains; domain values are now uniqued by coercing to a primitive value via <em>object</em>.valueOf instead of coercing to a string via <em>object</em>.toString.</p>\n<p>Array-likes (<em>e.g.</em>, a live NodeList such as <em>element</em>.childNodes) are converted to arrays in <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/main/README.md#selectAll\">d3.selectAll</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/main/README.md#selection_selectAll\"><em>selection</em>.selectAll</a>.</p>\n<h1>Changes in D3 6.0</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/tag/v6.0.0\">Released August 26, 2020.</a></p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>uses native collections</strong> (Map and Set) and <strong>accepts iterables</strong>. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-group\">d3.group and d3.rollup</a> are powerful new aggregation functions that replace d3.nest and work great <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/d/9a453665f405eebf\">with d3-hierarchy</a> and d3-selection. There are lots of new helpers in d3-array, too, such as <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-least\">d3.greatest</a>, <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>passes events directly to listeners</strong>, replacing the d3.event global and bringing D3 inline with vanilla JavaScript and most other frameworks.</p>\n<p><strong>d3-delaunay</strong> (based on Vladimir Agafonkin’s excellent <a href=\"https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator\">Delaunator</a>) replaces d3-voronoi, offering dramatic improvements to performance, robustness, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/delaunay-find\">search</a>. And there’s a new <a href=\"https://github.com/Fil/d3-geo-voronoi\">d3-geo-voronoi</a> for spherical (geographical) data! <strong>d3-random</strong> is <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md\">greatly expanded</a> and includes a fast <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-randomlcg\">linear congruential generator</a> for seeded randomness. <strong>d3-chord</strong> has new layouts for <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/directed-chord-diagram\">directed</a> and transposed chord diagrams. <strong>d3-scale</strong> adds a new <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-stacked-bar-chart-ii\">radial scale</a> type.</p>\n<p>… and a variety of other small enhancements. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery\">More than 450 examples</a> have been updated to D3 6.0!</p>\n<h3>d3-array</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Accept iterables.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#group\">d3.group</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#groups\">d3.groups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#index\">d3.index</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#indexes\">d3.indexes</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollup\">d3.rollup</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollups\">d3.rollups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#maxIndex\">d3.maxIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#minIndex\">d3.minIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatest\">d3.greatest</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatestIndex\">d3.greatestIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#least\">d3.least</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#leastIndex\">d3.leastIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#count\">d3.count</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cumsum\">d3.cumsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#Adder\">d3.Adder</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quantileSorted\">d3.quantileSorted</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bisector_center\"><em>bisector</em>.center</a>.</li>\n<li>Allow more than two iterables for <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cross\">d3.cross</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Access to prototype properties is forbidden completely by default, specific properties or methods\ncan be allowed via runtime-options. See <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/issues/1633\">#1633</a> for details.

For more, please read <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c\">Sindre Sorhus’s FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a> now ignores nulls. <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#ascending\">d3.ascending</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#descending\">d3.descending</a> no longer consider null comparable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/main/README.md#ordinal-scales\">Ordinal scales</a> now use <a href=\"https://github.com/mbostock/internmap\">InternMap</a> for domains; domain values are now uniqued by coercing to a primitive value via <em>object</em>.valueOf instead of coercing to a string via <em>object</em>.toString.</p>\n<p>Array-likes (<em>e.g.</em>, a live NodeList such as <em>element</em>.childNodes) are converted to arrays in <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/main/README.md#selectAll\">d3.selectAll</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/main/README.md#selection_selectAll\"><em>selection</em>.selectAll</a>.</p>\n<h1>Changes in D3 6.0</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/tag/v6.0.0\">Released August 26, 2020.</a></p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>uses native collections</strong> (Map and Set) and <strong>accepts iterables</strong>. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-group\">d3.group and d3.rollup</a> are powerful new aggregation functions that replace d3.nest and work great <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/d/9a453665f405eebf\">with d3-hierarchy</a> and d3-selection. There are lots of new helpers in d3-array, too, such as <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-least\">d3.greatest</a>, <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>passes events directly to listeners</strong>, replacing the d3.event global and bringing D3 inline with vanilla JavaScript and most other frameworks.</p>\n<p><strong>d3-delaunay</strong> (based on Vladimir Agafonkin’s excellent <a href=\"https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator\">Delaunator</a>) replaces d3-voronoi, offering dramatic improvements to performance, robustness, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/delaunay-find\">search</a>. And there’s a new <a href=\"https://github.com/Fil/d3-geo-voronoi\">d3-geo-voronoi</a> for spherical (geographical) data! <strong>d3-random</strong> is <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md\">greatly expanded</a> and includes a fast <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-randomlcg\">linear congruential generator</a> for seeded randomness. <strong>d3-chord</strong> has new layouts for <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/directed-chord-diagram\">directed</a> and transposed chord diagrams. <strong>d3-scale</strong> adds a new <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-stacked-bar-chart-ii\">radial scale</a> type.</p>\n<p>… and a variety of other small enhancements. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery\">More than 450 examples</a> have been updated to D3 6.0!</p>\n<h3>d3-array</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Accept iterables.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#group\">d3.group</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#groups\">d3.groups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#index\">d3.index</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#indexes\">d3.indexes</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollup\">d3.rollup</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollups\">d3.rollups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#maxIndex\">d3.maxIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#minIndex\">d3.minIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatest\">d3.greatest</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatestIndex\">d3.greatestIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#least\">d3.least</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#leastIndex\">d3.leastIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#count\">d3.count</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cumsum\">d3.cumsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#Adder\">d3.Adder</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quantileSorted\">d3.quantileSorted</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bisector_center\"><em>bisector</em>.center</a>.</li>\n<li>Allow more than two iterables for <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cross\">d3.cross</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

For more, please read <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c\">Sindre Sorhus’s FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a> now ignores nulls. <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#ascending\">d3.ascending</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#descending\">d3.descending</a> no longer consider null comparable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/main/README.md#ordinal-scales\">Ordinal scales</a> now use <a href=\"https://github.com/mbostock/internmap\">InternMap</a> for domains; domain values are now uniqued by coercing to a primitive value via <em>object</em>.valueOf instead of coercing to a string via <em>object</em>.toString.</p>\n<p>Array-likes (<em>e.g.</em>, a live NodeList such as <em>element</em>.childNodes) are converted to arrays in <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/main/README.md#selectAll\">d3.selectAll</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/main/README.md#selection_selectAll\"><em>selection</em>.selectAll</a>.</p>\n<h1>Changes in D3 6.0</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/tag/v6.0.0\">Released August 26, 2020.</a></p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>uses native collections</strong> (Map and Set) and <strong>accepts iterables</strong>. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-group\">d3.group and d3.rollup</a> are powerful new aggregation functions that replace d3.nest and work great <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/d/9a453665f405eebf\">with d3-hierarchy</a> and d3-selection. There are lots of new helpers in d3-array, too, such as <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-least\">d3.greatest</a>, <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>passes events directly to listeners</strong>, replacing the d3.event global and bringing D3 inline with vanilla JavaScript and most other frameworks.</p>\n<p><strong>d3-delaunay</strong> (based on Vladimir Agafonkin’s excellent <a href=\"https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator\">Delaunator</a>) replaces d3-voronoi, offering dramatic improvements to performance, robustness, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/delaunay-find\">search</a>. And there’s a new <a href=\"https://github.com/Fil/d3-geo-voronoi\">d3-geo-voronoi</a> for spherical (geographical) data! <strong>d3-random</strong> is <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md\">greatly expanded</a> and includes a fast <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-randomlcg\">linear congruential generator</a> for seeded randomness. <strong>d3-chord</strong> has new layouts for <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/directed-chord-diagram\">directed</a> and transposed chord diagrams. <strong>d3-scale</strong> adds a new <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-stacked-bar-chart-ii\">radial scale</a> type.</p>\n<p>… and a variety of other small enhancements. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery\">More than 450 examples</a> have been updated to D3 6.0!</p>\n<h3>d3-array</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Accept iterables.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#group\">d3.group</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#groups\">d3.groups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#index\">d3.index</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#indexes\">d3.indexes</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollup\">d3.rollup</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollups\">d3.rollups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#maxIndex\">d3.maxIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#minIndex\">d3.minIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatest\">d3.greatest</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatestIndex\">d3.greatestIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#least\">d3.least</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#leastIndex\">d3.leastIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#count\">d3.count</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cumsum\">d3.cumsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#Adder\">d3.Adder</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quantileSorted\">d3.quantileSorted</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bisector_center\"><em>bisector</em>.center</a>.</li>\n<li>Allow more than two iterables for <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cross\">d3.cross</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

For more, please read <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c\">Sindre Sorhus’s FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a> now ignores nulls. <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#ascending\">d3.ascending</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#descending\">d3.descending</a> no longer consider null comparable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/main/README.md#ordinal-scales\">Ordinal scales</a> now use <a href=\"https://github.com/mbostock/internmap\">InternMap</a> for domains; domain values are now uniqued by coercing to a primitive value via <em>object</em>.valueOf instead of coercing to a string via <em>object</em>.toString.</p>\n<p>Array-likes (<em>e.g.</em>, a live NodeList such as <em>element</em>.childNodes) are converted to arrays in <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/main/README.md#selectAll\">d3.selectAll</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/main/README.md#selection_selectAll\"><em>selection</em>.selectAll</a>.</p>\n<h1>Changes in D3 6.0</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/tag/v6.0.0\">Released August 26, 2020.</a></p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>uses native collections</strong> (Map and Set) and <strong>accepts iterables</strong>. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-group\">d3.group and d3.rollup</a> are powerful new aggregation functions that replace d3.nest and work great <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/d/9a453665f405eebf\">with d3-hierarchy</a> and d3-selection. There are lots of new helpers in d3-array, too, such as <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-least\">d3.greatest</a>, <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>passes events directly to listeners</strong>, replacing the d3.event global and bringing D3 inline with vanilla JavaScript and most other frameworks.</p>\n<p><strong>d3-delaunay</strong> (based on Vladimir Agafonkin’s excellent <a href=\"https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator\">Delaunator</a>) replaces d3-voronoi, offering dramatic improvements to performance, robustness, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/delaunay-find\">search</a>. And there’s a new <a href=\"https://github.com/Fil/d3-geo-voronoi\">d3-geo-voronoi</a> for spherical (geographical) data! <strong>d3-random</strong> is <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md\">greatly expanded</a> and includes a fast <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-randomlcg\">linear congruential generator</a> for seeded randomness. <strong>d3-chord</strong> has new layouts for <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/directed-chord-diagram\">directed</a> and transposed chord diagrams. <strong>d3-scale</strong> adds a new <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-stacked-bar-chart-ii\">radial scale</a> type.</p>\n<p>… and a variety of other small enhancements. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery\">More than 450 examples</a> have been updated to D3 6.0!</p>\n<h3>d3-array</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Accept iterables.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#group\">d3.group</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#groups\">d3.groups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#index\">d3.index</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#indexes\">d3.indexes</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollup\">d3.rollup</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollups\">d3.rollups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#maxIndex\">d3.maxIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#minIndex\">d3.minIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatest\">d3.greatest</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatestIndex\">d3.greatestIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#least\">d3.least</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#leastIndex\">d3.leastIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#count\">d3.count</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cumsum\">d3.cumsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#Adder\">d3.Adder</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quantileSorted\">d3.quantileSorted</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bisector_center\"><em>bisector</em>.center</a>.</li>\n<li>Allow more than two iterables for <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cross\">d3.cross</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

closes <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-javascript/issues/1498\">#1498</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why</h2>\n<p>The <code>trending-facets</code> API only returns type <code>string</code> for <code>facetValue</code>.</p>\n<p>A follow-up on <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-javascript/issues/1494\">#1494</a> as other models return items/hits which are of type <code>RecordWithObjectID</code></p>\n<p>However, <code>trending-facets</code> model returns a list of TrendingFacetHit which (by definition) don't have an <code>objectID</code> property.</p>\n<h2>How</h2>\n<p>To simplify the code, we can remove the type argument <code>TObject</code> for <code>trending-facets</code></p>\n<h2>Impact</h2>\n<p>If you're not using TypeScript or the <code>trending-facets</code> model, there is nothing to change. You can ignore the following.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, you will need to remove the type argument passed to <code>getTrendingFacets</code> and the code goes from this:</p>\n<pre lang=\"tsx\"><code>type FacetType = {\n  facetName: string;\n  facetValue: string;\n}\nconst { results } = await client.getTrendingFacets&lt;FacetType&gt;(/**/)\n</code></pre>\n<p>To this:</p>\n<pre lang=\"tsx\"><code>const { results } = await client.getTrendingFacets(/**/)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>4.21.1</h2>\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-javascript/compare/4.21.0...4.21.1\">v4.21.1</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>fix(recommend): RecommendedForYouQuery userToken should be required (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-javascript/issues/1496\">#1496</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-javascript/commit/d20b253\">d20b253</a>), closes <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-javascript/issues/1496\">#1496</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

<code>rangeRound</code> field in the input of <code>scaleLinear()</code>, <code>scaleLog()</code>, <code>scalePoint()</code>, <code>scalePower()</code>, <code>scaleSqrt()</code>, <code>scaleTime()</code> and <code>scaleUtc()</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/766\">#766</a>\nInstead of\n<pre lang=\"ts\"><code>scaleLinear({ rangeRound: xxx })\n</code></pre>\nDo this instead\n<pre lang=\"ts\"><code>scaleLinear({ range: xxx, round: true });\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>[scale] Deprecate <code>ticks</code> and <code>tickFormat</code> in the input of <code>scaleQuantize()</code>. It was not really doing anything anyway as both <code>scale.ticks()</code> and <code>scale.tickFormat()</code> do not mutate the scale. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/766\">#766</a></li>\n<li>[scale] Remove <code>scale.type</code> field that was attached to the d3 scales. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/766\">#766</a></li>\n<li>[grid] <code>@vx/grid</code> components now accept D3 Scale as generic type instead of <code>ScaleInput</code>. Developers should not expect to specify this generic type as it can be inferred from the passed scale. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/775\">#775</a></li>\n<li>[grid] Renames <code>GridColumnProps</code> =&gt; <code>GridColumnsProps</code> (+<code>s</code>) to match <code>GridRowsProps</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/787\">#787</a></li>\n<li>[legend] Update generic types for legend components. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/777\">#777</a></li>\n<li>[marker] remove old <a href=\"https://github.com/hshoff/vx/blob/v0.0.198/packages/vx-marker/src/markers/Marker.tsx#L72-L98\"><code>&lt;Marker /&gt;</code></a> implementation of a Line and some Text. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/783\">#783</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>:rocket:  Enhancements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>[scale] new functions &amp; New fields for the scale configs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/766\">#766</a></li>\n<li>[scale] add meta scale types. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/770\">#770</a></li>\n<li>[scale] Add fallback overload for createScale. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/791\">#791</a></li>\n<li>[scale]  add new types: <code>AnyD3Scale</code>, <code>InferD3ScaleOutput</code>, <code>InferD3ScaleDiscreteInput</code>, <code>InferD3ScaleThresholdInput</code> and <code>ScaleInput</code>. Add new utilities functions: <code>getTicks</code>, <code>coerceNumber</code> and <code>toString</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/773\">#773</a></li>\n<li>[scale] add reverse field to scale config.

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.3.2</h2>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Passing a percentage unit to the global <code>abs()</code> is deprecated since Dart Sass v1.65.0. It resulted in a deprecation warning when compiling Bootstrap with Dart Sass. This has been fixed internally by changing the values passed to the <code>divide()</code> function.

SUMMARY\r\nThe API responses for fetching all charts (`/api/v1/chart/`) and all datasets (`/api/v1/dataset/`) don't include the `changed_by.id` attribute. This is useful when implementing automations to maintain content (that involve reaching out to the user that last modified it). \r\n\r\nThis PR includes this field in the two API responses. It is already available when fetching all dashboards (`/api/v1/dashboard/`).\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Make sure you have at least 1 chart and 1 dashboard created.\r\n2. Overwrite/modify both of them.\r\n3. Send a `GET` request to `/api/v1/chart/` and confirm the `changed_by.id` is visible there. \r\n4. Send a `GET` request to `/api/v1/dataset/` and confirm the `changed_by.id` is visible there. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

<code>rangeRound</code> field in the input of <code>scaleLinear()</code>, <code>scaleLog()</code>, <code>scalePoint()</code>, <code>scalePower()</code>, <code>scaleSqrt()</code>, <code>scaleTime()</code> and <code>scaleUtc()</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/766\">#766</a>\nInstead of\n<pre lang=\"ts\"><code>scaleLinear({ rangeRound: xxx })\n</code></pre>\nDo this instead\n<pre lang=\"ts\"><code>scaleLinear({ range: xxx, round: true });\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>[scale] Deprecate <code>ticks</code> and <code>tickFormat</code> in the input of <code>scaleQuantize()</code>. It was not really doing anything anyway as both <code>scale.ticks()</code> and <code>scale.tickFormat()</code> do not mutate the scale. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/766\">#766</a></li>\n<li>[scale] Remove <code>scale.type</code> field that was attached to the d3 scales. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/766\">#766</a></li>\n<li>[grid] <code>@vx/grid</code> components now accept D3 Scale as generic type instead of <code>ScaleInput</code>. Developers should not expect to specify this generic type as it can be inferred from the passed scale. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/775\">#775</a></li>\n<li>[grid] Renames <code>GridColumnProps</code> =&gt; <code>GridColumnsProps</code> (+<code>s</code>) to match <code>GridRowsProps</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/787\">#787</a></li>\n<li>[legend] Update generic types for legend components. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/777\">#777</a></li>\n<li>[marker] remove old <a href=\"https://github.com/hshoff/vx/blob/v0.0.198/packages/vx-marker/src/markers/Marker.tsx#L72-L98\"><code>&lt;Marker /&gt;</code></a> implementation of a Line and some Text. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/783\">#783</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>:rocket:  Enhancements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>[scale] new functions &amp; New fields for the scale configs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/766\">#766</a></li>\n<li>[scale] add meta scale types. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/770\">#770</a></li>\n<li>[scale] Add fallback overload for createScale. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/791\">#791</a></li>\n<li>[scale]  add new types: <code>AnyD3Scale</code>, <code>InferD3ScaleOutput</code>, <code>InferD3ScaleDiscreteInput</code>, <code>InferD3ScaleThresholdInput</code> and <code>ScaleInput</code>. Add new utilities functions: <code>getTicks</code>, <code>coerceNumber</code> and <code>toString</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hshoff/vx/pull/773\">#773</a></li>\n<li>[scale] add reverse field to scale config.

the requirements on [react-resizable](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-resizable) to permit the latest version.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-resizable/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">react-resizable's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>3.0.5 (Mar 21, 2023)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>🐛 Bugfix: Make <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> conditionally required if an <code>axis</code> is set. See <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/react-grid-layout/react-resizable/issues/196\">#196</a></li>\n<li>✏ Chore: Minor dependency upgrades.</li>\n<li>✏ Chore: Fix documentation of <code>onResize</code> callback arity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3.0.4 (Jun 15, 2021)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>🐛 Bugfix: Fix incorrect fix for <code>handleAxis</code> on DOM elements. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/react-grid-layout/react-resizable/issues/175\">#175</a></li>\n<li>✏ Chore:Upgrade dependencies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3.0.3 (Jun 14, 2021)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>🐛 Bugfix: Remove unknown prop <code>handleAxis</code> making it to DOM elements, causing a warning in dev.</li>\n<li>✏ Chore: Rewrote <code>lockAspectRatio</code> logic to be more accurate and shorter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3.0.2 (Jun 8, 2021)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>✏ Chore: Add documentation for resize handles and fix a mistake where the <code>handleAxis</code> prop was not being passed to custom components.\n<ul>\n<li>See <a href=\"https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-resizable/blob/master/README.md#resize-handle\">Resize Handles</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3.0.1 (May 10, 2021)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>✏ Chore: Reduce package size through <code>.npmignore</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3.0.0 (May 10, 2021)</h3>\n<h4>Breaking</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>🐛 Bugfix: Fixed handling of the <code>nodeRef</code> that needs to be passed to <code>&lt;DraggableCore&gt;</code> to avoid use of ReactDOM. This means that vanilla usage of <code>react-resizable</code> no longer requires ReactDOM. No code changes are needed in the usual case, except:\n<ul>\n<li>React <code>&gt;= 16.3</code> is required due to use of <code>React.createRef()</code>, and</li>\n<li>The <code>handle</code> prop now sends a <code>ReactRef&lt;HTMLElement&gt;</code> as its second argument and expects it to be used on your returned component.\n<ul>\n<li>If you do not attach the <code>ref</code>, you will receive the following error: <code>&quot;&lt;DraggableCore&gt; not mounted on DragStart!&quot;</code> This is due to the ref being present but not attached to any node.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1.11.1 (Mar 5, 2021)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>✏ Chore: Added React 17 to peerDependencies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1.11.0 (Sep 3, 2020)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>⚠ Important Notice!\n<ul>\n<li>React-Resizable 2.0.0 was published due to a breaking change in <code>props</code> handling. This change ended up actually completely breaking certain workflows, for the dubious benefit of making the code slightly simpler to add to. The breaking change has been reverted, 2.0.0 is now deprecated, and we will continue on the 1.x branch. Future breaking changes to <code>react-resizable</code> will upgrade the major version to <code>3</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>➕ Feature: <code>&lt;ResizableBox&gt;</code> now takes a <code>style</code> prop which will be applied on the wrapping <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> in this prop are ignored.</li>\n<li>🐛 Bugfix: remove unknown Prop <code>handle</code> from div children in Resizable <code>React.cloneElement</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/STRML/react-resizable/issues/124\">#124</a></li>\n<li>🐛 Bugfix: Fix top and left resizing jerkiness. Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/conor-kelleher\"><code>@​conor-kelleher</code></a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/STRML/react-resizable/pull/136\">#136</a></li>\n<li>✏ Chore: Improved test suite. Please contribute tests for your use cases if you have the time, I would really appreciate it! Thanks very much, <a href=\"https://github.com/Danielecina\"><code>@​Danielecina</code></a></li>\n<li>✏ Chore: Minor internal refactors and additional tests.</li>\n<li>✏ Chore: Additional examples.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1.10.1 (Nov 25, 2019)</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
