PR is a minor fix for #3683\r\n\r\nThe `dags_in_image` config value is read as a string. However, the existing code expects this to be a boolean.\r\n\r\nFor example, in `worker_configuration.py` there is the statement: `if not self.kube_config.dags_in_image:`\r\n\r\nSince the value is a non-empty string ('False') and not a boolean, this evaluates to true (since non-empty strings are truthy)\r\nand skips the logic to add the `dags_volume_claim` volume mount.\r\n\r\nThis results in the CI tests failing because the dag volume is missing in the k8s pod definition.\r\n\r\nThis PR reads the `dags_in_image` using the `conf.getboolean` to fix this error.\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-13T18:45:55Z","updated_at":"2018-12-17T18:16:56Z","closed_at":"2018-12-17T07:05:27Z","merged_at":"2018-12-17T07:05:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"067b9671e9ccdbcfea0831c3d099aec51b00f242","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4319/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4319/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4319/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/86f4ecc5c06e68ac9255e5c2c4978e655bd23073","head":{"label":"kppullin:dags-in-image-fix","ref":"dags-in-image-fix","sha":"86f4ecc5c06e68ac9255e5c2c4978e655bd23073","user":{"login":"kppullin","id":369946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTk0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/369946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin","html_url":"https://github.com/kppullin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":158459380,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTg0NTkzODA=","name":"airflow","full_name":"kppullin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kppullin","id":369946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTk0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/369946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin","html_url":"https://github.com/kppullin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kppullin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kppullin/airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3505\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n\r\nAs kubernetes is moving away from docker to OCI, it will be more correct to use the 'dags_in_image' name to be more container system agnostic\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

Jira\r\n\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3504\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n**=== UPDATED BASED ON THE LATEST COMMIT ===**\r\n\r\n#### The Issue That This PR Tried to Address\r\n\r\nFor both www/ and www_rbac/, there is \"/health\" endpoint, which is supposed to help users know the \"health\" condition of the Airflow application.\r\n\r\nBut the functionality of it at this moment is very limited. It can only help check if the webserver is running, but actually the \"health\" of the application may be bad even though this endpoint returns \"The server is healthy!\" (scheduler may be down, database backend may be disconnected, etc)\r\n\r\n#### What Have Been Done in This PR\r\n\r\nExtend the functionality of \"`/health`\" endpoint:\r\n\r\n1. Check if database backend can be connected;\r\n2. Check the latest scheduler heartbeat.\r\n\r\nThis is done for both `/www` and `/www_rbac`. Tests are added accordingly as well.\r\n\r\nNote that no authentication is required to access \"`/health`\" endpoint (no sensitive information will be exposed through it).\r\n\r\n(Deleted an unnecessary line in `airflow/www/views.py` as well)\r\n\r\n#### How Final Result Looks Like\r\n\r\nThe \"`/health`\" endpoint will return a JSON like\r\n\r\n```\r\n  {\r\n    \"metadatabase\":{\r\n      \"status\":\"healthy\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"scheduler\":{\r\n      \"status\":\"healthy\",\r\n      \"latest_scheduler_heartbeat\":\"2018-12-26 17:15:11+00:00\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Currently it simply returns \"`The server is healthy!`\", which is not very useful, and can't really check the health condition of the application)\r\n\r\n#### Others\r\n\r\n**No authentication is required to access this `/health` endpoint. This is a conscious decision.**\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nChanged tests below accordingly:\r\n- `tests/core.py` (for /www)\r\n- `tests/www_rbac/test_views.py` (for /www_rbac)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-3501\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3501\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-3501\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new config property named `use_container_dags` to the `kubernetes` configuration section.\r\n\r\nWhen this property is set to `True`, airflow will uses the dags packaged into the running docker container instead of loading them from a kubernetes volume mount or from a git init container.\r\n\r\nPrior to this change airflow forced loading dags either from a volume claim or an init container.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this change is to allow for an airflow image to be built and released via a CI/CD pipeline upon a new commit to a dag repository.  For example, given a new git commit to a dag repo, a CI/CD server can build an airflow docker image, run tests against the current dags, and finally push the entire bundle as a single, complete, well-known unit to kubernetes.\r\n\r\nThere's no need to worry that a git init container will fail, having to have a separate pipeline to update dags on a shared volume, etc.  And if issues arise from an update, the configuration can be easily rolled back to the prior version of the image.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow-3370](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3370)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Add additional options and documentation for using the ElasticsearchTaskHandler.\r\n\r\nThe easiest and most foolproof way to implement a logging solution is to write to the standard output streams (stdout and stderr). In the Kubernetes ecosystem, given that pods are killed and restarted constantly, this implies persistent storage is a requirement for log history preservation.\r\n\r\nFor the webserver and scheduler components of Airflow, logging to standard output streams is built in. However, when tasks are executed in Celery, workers will fork off child processes to execute tasks concurrently. Before the child process ends, it makes a call to the Airflow task logger, and a task log file is written to the file system.\r\n\r\nThis potentially causes several problems with the Airflow on top of Kubernetes architecture. Given that Airflow has a constant stream of log output, running an Airflow environment using Celery in a Kubernetes cluster requires large amounts of memory resources. As such, when memory resources are exceeded, either 1) worker pods are often evicted by Kubernetes, or 2) worker output stalls and tasks pile up without completing. A current best-case workaround is to run a sidecar container that tails the `stdout` and `stderr` streams to read logs from the filesystem of the worker node and then output those logs to its own standard output. However, this becomes a scaling issue when running multiple deployments, and is unsustainable for massive Airflow deployments.\r\n\r\nThe options that are added in this PR look to circumvent the need for persistent volumes in worker nodes when running Airflow on Kubernetes. Workers will no longer need to be Stateful Sets and can instead be Deployments. \r\n\r\nThe `elasticsearch_write_stdout` flag in `airflow.cfg` will allow the child process to write its log output to the parent process standard output stream.\r\nThe `elasticsearch_json_format` flag in `airflow.cfg` allows additional optional JSON configuration for task instances based on the `logging` module LogRecord attributes. This must be used in conjunction with the `elasticsearch_record_labels` configuration. \r\n\r\nA potential use case for these options is precisely when setting up a log monitoring stack, such as EFK (Elasticsearch FluentD Kibana), without requiring persistent volumes. A FluentD daemon listening on every node is awaiting log output on the standard output stream. With the `write_stdout` flag set, it can capture the task log information that has been executed on child processes from the parent process standard output. Using the `json_format` field, FluentD can be configured to filter and specify log records, without needing to parse the standard Airflow log formatted record, before sending it off to a destination, such as Elasticsearch, where it can stored and handled independent of Airflow on Kubernetes.\r\n\r\nIf either of these options are NULL, or not set, the `es_task_handler.py` will function exactly as before, and will only have read functionality. The options in this PR simply provide more functionality and options to users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n#### handler close\r\n- test_close_stdout_logs\r\n- test_close_closed_stdout_logs\r\n- test_close_no_mark_end_stdout_logs\r\n- test_close_with_no_handler_stdout_logs\r\n- test_close_with_no_stream_stdout_logs\r\n\r\n#### handler read\r\n- test_read_stdout_logs\r\n- test_read_nonexistent_log_stdout_logs\r\n- test_read_raises_stdout_logs_json_true\r\n- test_read_timeout_stdout_logs\r\n- test_read_with_empty_metadata_stdout_logs\r\n- test_read_with_none_metadata_stdout_logs\r\n\r\n#### handler render_log_id and set_context\r\n- test_render_log_id_json_true\r\n- test_set_context_stdout_logs\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] No jira\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] This script is useful (though not fool-proof if a PR addresses multiple\r\nJira tickets) for comparing what issues are marked as fixed in a release\r\nvs what PRs are actually on the (current) branch.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n    git co v1-10-test\r\n    ./dev/airflow-jira compare 1.10.2\r\n\r\nPrior to this change only the first 50 issues would come back, which for\r\n1.10.1 wasn't enough as we ended up with over 100 issues targeting that\r\nbranch.\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] no tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-10T10:05:10Z","updated_at":"2019-04-04T14:52:58Z","closed_at":"2018-12-15T11:50:22Z","merged_at":"2018-12-15T11:50:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"9a94f0d4d0c2a7337d651b26f561e913578b578f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4300/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4300/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4300/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/d52cf23adc035e7dd37768c82e65840b93bf0284","head":{"label":"ashb:airflow-compare-full-results","ref":"airflow-compare-full-results","sha":"d52cf23adc035e7dd37768c82e65840b93bf0284","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94879701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDg3OTcwMQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"ashb/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ashb/airflow","description":"Apache

Jira\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses [[AIRFLOW-2508] Handle non string types in render_template_from_field](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2508)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `BaseOperator.render_template_from_field` method behavior: \r\n- it was previously rendering `string_types` and supporting `Number`s (and collections or dictionaries of these types); but it was raising an `AirflowException` on any other type.\r\n- it is now supporting any other type (by returning the value as is)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the following unit tests on `BaseOperator.render_template_from_field` method:\r\n- rendering a list of strings\r\n- rendering a tuple of strings\r\n- rendering dictionary values\r\n- showing dictionary keys are not templatized\r\n- returning a `date` as is\r\n- returning a `datetime` as is\r\n- returning a `UUID` as is\r\n- returning an `object` as is\r\n\r\n### Notice\r\n\r\n**This PR adds [pyhamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/) to Airflow _test dependencies_.** This module helps writing meaningful assertions, and also provides very clear and helpful messages on test failures.\r\n\r\nIf Airflow maintainers do not want to include this test module, just let me know, and I'll rework unit tests \r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\nThis PR was made during working hours thanks to my employer: the [city of

allows one to wait on a DagRun at a specified execution date.\r\nThis pull request adds a new sensor in contrib called TriggeredDagRunSensor,\r\nwhich has a different approach. It allows one to wait on a DagRun for\r\n a given run_id without regard to execution date. This can be an advantage\r\n when a parent dag is triggering a child dag in a loop and it may be ambiguous based\r\non execution time alone which child DagRun belongs to which parent DagRun.\r\n\r\nThe TriggeredDagRunSensor takes a trigger_task_id, the id of a task that triggers DagRuns.\r\nThe trigger task returns a list of run_ids of the DagRuns it triggered and the\r\nsensor polls their status. For this purpose the TriggerDagRunOperator\r\nwas modified so that it stores the run_id of the triggered DagRun.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1488\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nSee the above description.  I also copied quite a bit from the previous pull requests on this issue #2500 and #3234.  Unlike those attempts, the focus here is on triggered DagRuns.  I realize it may not be generally applicable to everyone's workflows but it has been very useful for us. At one point I considered using subdags but since they have had their issues I think this a good alternative.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nI included test_triggered_dagrun_sensor.py and test_triggered_dagrun_sensor_dag.py.  Currently, I'm running into an issue executing the test in the Docker environment because the sensor task has to wait on the triggered DagRun.  The DagRun is triggered but is never scheduled.  I think this is because the unit test uses the SequentialExecutor and SQLite.  If I run the scheduler manually, the triggered DagRun executes. I'm not sure what to do about this. For now, I've commented the successful DagRun test and have only the failed DagRun test active.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-07T02:10:46Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T20:47:00Z","closed_at":"2019-09-11T16:26:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"945716deba3218a786379c4ee0eda6b7062a4b60","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Jira\r\n\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3479\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n#### Problem This PR Tries to Address\r\n\r\nCurrently when we delete a DAG (using API or from the UI), it will delete all related records in all tables (all tables in which \"dag_id\" is available), including \"log\" table.\r\n\r\nHowever, the records in \"log\" table should be kept (by default). This would be ideal for multiple reasons, like auditing.\r\n\r\n#### What This PR Does\r\n\r\n- **When we delete DAG using API**: provide one boolean parameter to let users decide if they want to keep records in Log table when they delete a DAG. Default value it True (to keep records in Log table).\r\n\r\n- **When we delete DAG from UI**: will keep records in the Log table when delete records for a specific DAG ID (pop-up message is updated accordingly).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nTest cases are added to cover:\r\n1. Delete a DAG which doesn't exist.\r\n1. Delete a DAG which is still in DagBag.\r\n1. Successfully delete a DAG + keep records in Log table.\r\n1.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

of passing transfer operator descriptions through generic\r\nkwargs, accept description as a named parameter; no other parameters are\r\naccepted by the API, so generic kwargs aren't useful.

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3444\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe `S3ToGoogleCloudStorageTransferOperator` should support an explicit `description` parameter and allow that parameter to be templated. This will make it easier to set job descriptions, and we'll be able to drop the `job_kwargs` attribute, which doesn't have any other use.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nUpdates existing tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-05T05:24:53Z","updated_at":"2018-12-14T12:23:24Z","closed_at":"2018-12-14T12:23:24Z","merged_at":"2018-12-14T12:23:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"6422716d6e2b83f50be334814f018cfb688c2b3a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4279/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4279/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4279/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/d29994cc3f4edc67baf866e9b68c0762c16d91d7","head":{"label":"jmcarp:transfer-operator-updates","ref":"transfer-operator-updates","sha":"d29994cc3f4edc67baf866e9b68c0762c16d91d7","user":{"login":"jmcarp","id":1633460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM0NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp","html_url":"https://github.com/jmcarp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53240459,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzI0MDQ1OQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"jmcarp/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jmcarp","id":1633460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM0NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp","html_url":"https://github.com/jmcarp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jmcarp/airflow","description":"Airflow

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"","created_at":"2018-12-04T17:22:32Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T09:49:42Z","closed_at":"2019-06-26T09:49:41Z","merged_at":"2019-06-26T09:49:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"82b7b8fc5d5769efb56131eb8a847c92f3f812ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4277/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4277/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4277/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/290c613da4edb50157b4de5b8aa405bd071893d4","head":{"label":"jmeickle:wordwrap","ref":"wordwrap","sha":"290c613da4edb50157b4de5b8aa405bd071893d4","user":{"login":"jmeickle","id":536435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle","html_url":"https://github.com/jmeickle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":132631577,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzI2MzE1Nzc=","name":"airflow","full_name":"jmeickle/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jmeickle","id":536435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle","html_url":"https://github.com/jmeickle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jmeickle/airflow","description":"Apache

password_auth\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x]  Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n- `airflow.contrib.auth.backends.password_auth.load_user` would query `models.User` and cast the result to `PasswordUser` instead of querying `PasswordUser` directly. This would map the model's fields to a nested instance, e.g., `password_user_instance.user.superuser` instead of the expected `password_user_instance.superuser`.\r\n\r\n- The `superuser` field is added to `models.User` in the form of a SQLAlchemy column, instead of a hard-coded boolean.\r\n\r\n- The overridden `PasswordUser.is_superuser` method is removed, so the actual value in the database is referenced instead.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

title. \r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3438\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nBigQueryOperator currently sets default value of udf_config to False. This no longer works due to https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3733 validating the type of that parameter as either None or list. Default value needs to be changed to None.\r\n\r\nThe line in question added in the commit referenced above\r\n```\r\n(udf_config, 'userDefinedFunctionResources', None, list),\r\n```\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nScenario -> Developer wants to trigger DAG_RUN through API\r\n\r\nIssue -> Current rest API \"/api/experimental/dags/<dag_id>dag_runs\"returns message like below, which makes difficult for developer to figure out execution date/run_id and execution date/run_id extract logic has to be written  \r\n\r\n{ \"message\": \"Created <DagRun example_bash_operator @ 2018-12-03 11:16:36+00:00: manual__2018-12-03T11:16:36+00:00, externally triggered: True>\" }\r\nImprovement Suggestion -> rest API \"/api/experimental/dags/<dag_id>dag_runs\" should return json representing dag_run object , something like below\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n{ \"dag_id\": \"example_bash_operator\", \"dag_run_url\": \"/admin/airflow/graph?execution_date=2018-12-03+11%3A11%3A18%2B00%3A00&dag_id=example_bash_operator\", \"execution_date\": \"2018-12-03T11:11:18+00:00\", \"id\": 142, \"run_id\": \"manual__2018-12-03T11:11:18+00:00\", \"start_date\": \"2018-12-03T11:11:18.267197+00:00\", \"state\": \"running\" }\r\n\\\r\n\r\nWith the Json returned as shown above , picking dag_run details becomes easy.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-03T11:21:28Z","updated_at":"2018-12-04T09:22:54Z","closed_at":"2018-12-04T09:22:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"304c8acffa5f405f1ec13d2cc6e88b8630bf2d86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4271/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4271/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4271/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/b6a5db22334ab511bb64c139fbf393843c124e2d","head":{"label":"PythonGirlSam:v-1.10_modifications","ref":"v-1.10_modifications","sha":"b6a5db22334ab511bb64c139fbf393843c124e2d","user":{"login":"PythonGirlSam","id":33459055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDU5MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33459055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam","html_url":"https://github.com/PythonGirlSam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159824109,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk4MjQxMDk=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"PythonGirlSam/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PythonGirlSam","id":33459055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDU5MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33459055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam","html_url":"https://github.com/PythonGirlSam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PythonGirlSam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PythonGirlSam/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3412\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n  - We need to pass 'try_number' parameter during the pod creation in kubernetes_executor.py, otherwise '_labels_to_key' function will always raise KeyError, making self.result_queue empty. \r\n  - As a result '_change_state' function in kubernetes_executor.py will never be called and pods will keep hanging after termination even if other pod deletion conditions are met.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - Not sure how to write one for this particular case, maybe someone will help?\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-02T16:34:24Z","updated_at":"2019-04-14T17:49:43Z","closed_at":"2019-04-14T17:49:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0779d96984c552c9aa6b8e9b636df223b1b9d5ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4268/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4268/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4268/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/e2bbeec5ae419e7c723d84bb74803bf6ad3541e6","head":{"label":"legion-platform:fix/fix-pod-autodeletion","ref":"fix/fix-pod-autodeletion","sha":"e2bbeec5ae419e7c723d84bb74803bf6ad3541e6","user":{"login":"legion-platform","id":38894075,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM4ODk0MDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38894075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform","html_url":"https://github.com/legion-platform","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159481724,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0ODE3MjQ=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"legion-platform/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"legion-platform","id":38894075,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM4ODk0MDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38894075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform","html_url":"https://github.com/legion-platform","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/legion-platform/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/legion-platform/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThere were a number of minor formatting glitches that meant these didn't\r\ndisplay 100% right once written to HTML. I use \"intersphinx\" ext to link directly to the boto3 class-names by name, rather than URL.\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n![screen shot 2018-12-01 at 23 30 57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34150/49334053-5c412080-f5c3-11e8-9c9b-78a181158f64.png)\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n![screen shot 2018-12-01 at 23 30 31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34150/49334054-63682e80-f5c3-11e8-9c4d-352cfbea1d13.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nEmpty login and schema are returned by Airflow as empty strings, not as `None`. As a result incorrect URL is generated, causing authentication to fail.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nShould fall under existing mongo hook testcases\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-30T09:52:25Z","updated_at":"2019-03-25T11:57:56Z","closed_at":"2019-03-25T11:57:56Z","merged_at":"2019-03-25T11:57:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"760925bb040ce42abdd0240498c0cb3c2564d909","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4258/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4258/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4258/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/da10ae850b1c0839a4bc907814bf525f507fbe57","head":{"label":"ms32035:mongo_hook_fix","ref":"mongo_hook_fix","sha":"da10ae850b1c0839a4bc907814bf525f507fbe57","user":{"login":"ms32035","id":5060473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjA0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5060473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035","html_url":"https://github.com/ms32035","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115654468,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU2NTQ0Njg=","name":"airflow","full_name":"ms32035/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ms32035","id":5060473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjA0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5060473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035","html_url":"https://github.com/ms32035","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms32035/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ms32035/airflow","description":"Apache

Jira\r\n\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3239\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up on JIRA 3239, to **further fix the unit tests**.\r\n\r\nEarlier related PRs: https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4074, https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4131.\r\n\r\n#### What is done in this PR\r\n\r\n- 1. Fixed (test_)trigger_dag.py by correcting its name, so it can be discovered by the CI.\r\n\r\n- 2. Fix (test_)mark_tasks.py\r\n  - 2-1. properly name the file, so it can be discovered by the CI.\r\n  - 2-2. Correct the name of sample DAG\r\n  - 2-3. Correct the range of sample execution_dates\r\n       (earlier one conflicts with the start_date of the sample DAG, which fails the test case)\r\n  - 2-4. Skip `test_mark_tasks_subdag` when running with MySQL\r\n       Seems something is wrong with `airflow.api.common.experimental.mark_tasks.set_state`. Corresponding test case (process subdags with `downstream=True`) works on Postgres & SQLite, but fails when on MySQL (\"`(1062, \"Duplicate entry '110' for key 'PRIMARY'\")`\". Example: https://travis-ci.org/XD-DENG/incubator-airflow/jobs/461200901). A TODO note is added to remind us fix it for MySQL later.\r\n\r\n- 3. Remove unnecessary lines in test_pool.py\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3414) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3414\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n`six.moves.reload_module` will throw exception if the module it is trying to reload has not been loaded yet. This will be the case if we loaded custom logging class and then try to reload the default logging module. This change will make sure we always load the already loaded logging module.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntests/utils/test_dag_processing.py\r\n\r\nNote that the unit test covers the case where we loaded BOTH default logging module and are trying to reload custom logging module but not the case where default logging module is not loaded. This is because the test env already has the default logging module loaded and it would be risky to modify the loaded module list. The case is instead covered in local tests( using custom logging and the cluster is healthy).\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses fixing a typo in the documentation and so prepends commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\].\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nApplies to `master`; pull request 4241 applies to `v1-10-stable.\r\n\r\n- Started with \"habe\", \"serever\" and \"certificiate\" needing to be:  \r\n  \"have\", \"server\", and \"certificate\".\r\n- Ran a check, ignoring British and US accepted spellings.\r\n- Kept jargon. EG admin, aync, auth, backend, config, dag, s3, utils, etc.\r\n- Took exception to:\r\n  - \"num of dag run\" meaning \"number of dag runs\",\r\n  - \"upness\" is normally for quarks,\r\n  - \"url\" being lower-case, and\r\n  - sftp example having an excess file ending.\r\n- Python documentation writes \"builtin\" hyphenated, cases \"PYTHONPATH\".\r\n- Gave up on mixed use of \"dag\" and \"DAG\" as well as long line lengths.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason: It is scoped to documentation\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] Updates only existing documentation.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

Description\r\n\r\nApplies to v1-10-stable; another pull will apply to master.\r\n\r\n- Started with \"habe\", \"serever\" and \"certificiate\" needing to be:  \r\n  \"have\", \"server\", and \"certificate\".\r\n- Ran a check, ignoring British and US accepted spellings.\r\n- Kept jargon. EG admin, aync, auth, backend, config, dag, s3, utils, etc.\r\n- Took exception to:\r\n  - \"num of dag run\" meaning \"number of dag runs\",\r\n  - \"upness\" is normally for quarks,\r\n  - \"url\" being lower-case, and\r\n  - sftp example having an excess file ending.\r\n- Python documentation writes \"builtin\" hyphenated, cases \"PYTHONPATH\".\r\n- Gave up on mixed use of \"dag\" and \"DAG\" as well as long line lengths.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason: It is scoped to documentation.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] Updates only existing documentation.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-27T05:47:54Z","updated_at":"2018-12-02T14:00:11Z","closed_at":"2018-11-27T11:26:53Z","merged_at":"2018-11-27T11:26:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"1f01446d7c1e6018e268a795cb10e21e6d82258b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4241/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4241/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4241/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/247e33653726c649f78022e61a8735bb79d9cf91","head":{"label":"dlamblin:UPDATING.md-typos","ref":"UPDATING.md-typos","sha":"247e33653726c649f78022e61a8735bb79d9cf91","user":{"login":"dlamblin","id":4128491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjg0OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4128491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin","html_url":"https://github.com/dlamblin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:v1-10-stable","ref":"v1-10-stable","sha":"76a5fc4d2eb3c214ca25406f03b4a0c5d7250f71","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3392) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3392\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe [select queries on sla_miss table](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/jobs.py#L669-L674) produce a great % of DB traffic and thus made the DB CPU usage unnecessarily high. It would be a low hanging fruit to add an index and reduce the load. After all such queries that are issued by the DagFileProcessor should be optimized as much as possible.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested within Airbnb's setup. In Airbnb's setup, the # of rows scanned by this query is ~80% of all row scanned. Add such index reduced ~30% of the DB CPU usage and the cluster has been running healthy for 1 month +. Below is the CPU usage metrics.\r\n\r\n![cpu_diff](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/49055356-27d8f900-f1ac-11e8-8346-1458fa36fb06.png) \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-25T04:43:30Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:49:32Z","closed_at":"2018-11-27T05:49:32Z","merged_at":"2018-11-27T05:49:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"0ac1e639d962f0f2f10846b60dee9818efd0b08f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4235/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4235/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4235/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/264a52db6b68ee84169177d596401778293f9a16","head":{"label":"KevinYang21:kevin_yang_add_sla_index","ref":"kevin_yang_add_sla_index","sha":"264a52db6b68ee84169177d596401778293f9a16","user":{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":106481430,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDY0ODE0MzA=","name":"airflow","full_name":"KevinYang21/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21/airflow","description":"Apache

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2761) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe change is depending on this PR: https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3873\r\n\r\nSummary of major changes:\r\n- Celery executor will create a process pool to enqueue celery task in parallel.\r\n- Scheduler job will not pass TaskInstance to executor when trying to queue command, instead it passes SimpleTaskInstance, in order to enable parallel enqueuing.\r\n- Scheduler no longer checks task instance state before enqueuing because worker already checks task instance state before executing. Our cluster has been requeuing everything for a long time and there should be no risk removing that redundant check.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\ntests/executors/test_celery_executor.py:TestCeleryExecutor.test_error_sending_task\r\ntests/jobs.py:SchedulerJobTest.test_change_state_for_tasks_failed_to_execute\r\n\r\nAlso updated existing failing unit test.\r\n\r\nThe change has been running in Airbnb internal cluster for 3 months+.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nBefore (32k tasks should run on 13:30 but didn't get >30k running tasks until 13:41):\r\n![screen shot 2018-08-31 at 3 26 48 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/45852558-3a8b0980-bcf5-11e8-803f-d98f56c81a9c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter (32k tasks should run on 15:10 and got them all running at 15:14):\r\n![screen shot 2018-08-31 at 3 26 11 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/45852419-97d28b00-bcf4-11e8-89b2-79481dbf8030.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-25T03:12:04Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T06:39:12Z","closed_at":"2018-11-28T22:23:45Z","merged_at":"2018-11-28T22:23:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"1d53f939669102cd0c8461ad9d756b3e0cf74dbe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4234/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4234/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4234/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/554b4cf08bcf371a95415d9a0cd88820f2d9272c","head":{"label":"KevinYang21:kevin_yang_parallelize_enqueue","ref":"kevin_yang_parallelize_enqueue","sha":"554b4cf08bcf371a95415d9a0cd88820f2d9272c","user":{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":106481430,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDY0ODE0MzA=","name":"airflow","full_name":"KevinYang21/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3383\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, it's not straightforward to rotate the fernet key for encrypted passwords and extras. A user would have to generate a new key, restart airflow, and manually re-enter each value to be encrypted via the web interface. It should be possible to specify multiple fernet keys at once, and to easily re-encrypt values with a new key. The cryptography package provides a MultiFernet class with a rotate method that handles this use case, so I wrote up a patch that uses MultiFernet to support multiple keys and rotation via the command line.\r\n\r\nWith this approach, we can rotate keys by adding a new key at the start of the FERNET_KEYS config variable, then running the rotate_credentials command from the command line. If the approach makes sense, I'll write up some documentation.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes
