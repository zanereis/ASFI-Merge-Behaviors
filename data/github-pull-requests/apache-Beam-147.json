Before merging\r\n\r\nBefore merging it is required to setup related secrets:\r\n * `GCP_PROJECT_ID` - ID of the Google Cloud project e.g: `apache-beam-testing`\r\n * `GCP_SA_EMAIL` - Service account email address to use for authentication. Service account requires `Storage Object Admin` role. e.g.: beam-wheels-staging-sa@bapache-beam-testing.iam.gserviceaccount.com\r\n * `GCP_SA_KEY` - The service account key which will be used for authentication. Service account requires `Storage Object Admin` role. This key should be created, encoded as a Base64 string (eg. `cat my-key.json | base64` on macOS)\r\n * Edit: since https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11877/commits/992ee80003573d1a9e3b536ddc9bc41f30e5d08b this is not required anymore.  `GCP_BUCKET` - name of the GCS Bucket e.g: `beam-wheels-staging`\r\n \r\n\r\n### Staging Bucket settings\r\n\r\nFor practical reasons staging bucket shall have versioning and lifecycle management.\r\n\r\n#### Object versioning\r\nit will keep previous versions of uploaded files in case of rerunning workflow.\r\n        e.g. paths:\r\n   - `gs://bucket-name/branch-name/8121a1...-140818789/`  - first build\r\n   - `gs://bucket-name/branch-name/8121a1...-140818789/`  - rerun workflow, new files versions\r\n   - `gs://bucket-name/branch-name/2323b0...-140818794/`  - new commit\r\n\r\nObject versioning cen be enabled by command:\r\n```\r\ngsutil versioning set on gs://[BUCKET_NAME]\r\n```\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/using-object-versioning\r\n\r\n#### Lifecycle management\r\nLifecycle management is able to delete files which are older than some given age.\r\nIt will prevent accumulating old files.\r\nI propose lifecycle settings as follows:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n   \"lifecycle\": {\r\n      \"rule\": [\r\n         {\r\n            \"action\": {\r\n               \"type\": \"Delete\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"condition\": {\r\n               \"age\": 365,\r\n               \"isLive\": true\r\n            }\r\n         },\r\n         {\r\n            \"action\": {\r\n               \"type\": \"Delete\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"condition\": {\r\n               \"age\": 90,\r\n               \"isLive\": false\r\n            }\r\n         }\r\n      ]\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ngsutil commnad:\r\n```\r\ngsutil lifecycle set lifecycle.json gs://[BUCKET_NAME]\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/managing-lifecycles\r\n\r\n\r\n#### JIRA\r\nSubtask of [BEAM-9388 - Consider using github actions for building python wheels and more (aka.

So there are a few cases that needed particular handling.\r\n\r\n* Happy Path: Instruction starts processing, creating a reader, and starts to read data before any data arrives.\r\n   * This case was handled very well already.\r\n* Initial data arrives before instruction start, and reader creation.\r\n  * This case was also handled well, data would be cached, and eventually cause push back until the instruction requests a reader, at which point it's the same as the happy path.\r\n* Initial data arrives and instruction never creates a reader.\r\n  * This can happen if there are issues initializing a DoFn in Setup or StartBundle. This can cause the worker to be hung for other bundles.\r\n* Initial data arrives after instruction ends.\r\n  * Similarly to the never creates a reader case, this can cause a hung worker. The data channel needs to be aware at least temporarily that the instruction is over and shouldn't create readers for it.\r\n\r\nWhen the ScopedDataManager is closed, all channels are notified to remove the instruction and close the readers and writers. \r\nAt the point in the stack where ScopedDataMana\r\n\r\nger is closed, readers needed to be handled carefully, but writers do not. Writers are only created by the DataSink node, and managed by the framework. In particular, if the writer was already closed, it would have removed themselves from the writer map on the Close call, preventing the ScopedDataManager from a double close. Otherwise, the writer would be in the map (such as due to a panic preventing the ordinary close), and need closing.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a draft]\r\n\r\nThe general idea here is that we use mixins (subclasses of `ArchiveFileSystemMixin`) for each archive type (tar, zip, etc.). Each mixin \"wraps\" the I/O operations of its corresponding FileSystem (GCSFileSystem, LocalFileSystem, etc.) so that it behaves like an archive that is mounted on its corresponding FileSystem.\r\n\r\nThis means that we can combine different mixins with different `FileSystem` backends -- for example, some combinations could include:\r\n- ZipFileSystemMixin + GcsFileSystem\r\n- ZipFileSystemMixin + LocalFileSystem\r\n- TarFileSystemMixin + S3FileSystem\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent usage (could change) -- the following is an example where s3://ashwin-bucket123/logs.zip contains *.log files that we want to match:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n  (\r\n      p\r\n      | MatchFiles(\"s3://ashwin-bucket123/logs.zip\")\r\n      | MatchExtractedFiles(\"*\")\r\n      | ReadMatches()\r\n      | Map(lambda x: x.open().read_utf8())\r\n      | Map(print)\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Adds transient ID fields to coder.Coder and coder.CustomCoder\r\n* These fields are only populated if these are generated from a Beam pipeline proto.\r\n* Include these in debug strings, to map where the coder came from.\r\n\r\nThe pipeline_proto_coder_id is used by dataflow to avoid re-synthesizing beam protos from dataflow's internal representations. However, they cannot currently be on every coder for simplicity. Fortunately, the Go SDK is very specific about what coders are custom, so these are only added directly to the internal coder representation, and not on one of the known types with sub components (eg kvs or length prefixes)\r\n\r\nGo's cogbklist URN was added into the known types for the data flow runner, and thus doesn't need one as of yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

only impacts Dataflow runner v2 since the new expansions are guarded by the experiment \"beam_fn_api\" and \"use_runner_v2\".\r\n\r\nThis currently has little benefit for portable runners since they still treat all views as in memory iterables of values but opens the door for them once we can remove the requirement on the \"use_runner_v2\" experiment. I did the pre-work to fill in the iterable support for non-Dataflow portable runners but it isn't exercised.\r\n\r\nThis builds on prior work for exposing iterable and multimap views to runners in BEAM-3419\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR does two things:\r\n- Raises a `RuntimeError` if Python 2 is used (just like we currently raise a `RuntimeError` if anything other than Python 2.7 / 3 is used)\r\n- Remove tests and build processes that are specific to Python 2. I just deleted most of these tests, but I moved some of them, such as `chicagoTaxiExample`, from Python 2 to Python 3.5 because they didn't seem to be covered in the existing Python 3 tests.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure when we want to move ahead with removing support for Python 2 (presumably we will do so this year), but wanted to make this PR so we would be ready to do so. I was thinking that in order to migrate from Python 2 -> 3, it would be safest to merge this PR first and then work on removing the Python 2 workarounds that we have in our code.\r\n\r\nCan you run the Jenkins tests on this PR to see where we are on this (and if there is anything in addition that needs to be changed)?\r\n\r\nR: @pabloem @tvalentyn \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
