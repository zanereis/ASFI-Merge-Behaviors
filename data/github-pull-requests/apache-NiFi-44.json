Updates include refactoring tests for `SslContextFactory` and `StandardTlsConfiguration` in `nifi-security-utils`.\r\n\r\nThe new `TemporaryKeyStoreBuilder` replaces references to `KeyStoreUtils.createKeyStoreAndGetX509Certificate()`, encapsulating `File.deleteOnExit()` as part of the build process.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include removing the unused `hadoop-minikdc` test dependency from `nifi-security-utils`. This change involved replacing `org.apache.kerby.util.Hex` with the Bouncy Castle `Hex` utility class.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9228 Refactors multiple unit tests and integration tests to use `KeyStoreUtils` to generate temporary KeyStore and TrustStore files in order to support TLS communication. This approach removes the need for files in the repository with certificate expiration dates leading to current and future build failures.\r\n\r\nChanges include removing JKS and PKCS12 test files from multiple modules, as well as removing multiple unnecessary Logback test configuration files.  Additional adjustments include removing logging from some impacted unit tests, and removing several integration tests that relied on hard-coded KeyStores.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

is my proposal to extend the capability of NiFi to gather necessary resources by itself. Based on the recently added \"NAR Provider\" functionality, this aims to be a more generalised solution for the issue: by adding providers, NiFi will be capable to collect driver jars and other necessary files from different sources (right now: from HDFS). To achieve this, I extracted the \"NAR Provider\" and refactored the code to be more configurable. This also involves the \"NAR Provider\" itself, which is now depending on the new version. For compatibility reasons, some of the interface and the HDFS implementation remained there, but they are backed by the Flow Resource Processor class family. Thank you for taking the time to take a look on this proposal, any opinion is welcomed!\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Adds a ParameterValueProvider using AWS SecretsManager_\r\n\r\nTo test:\r\n\r\n```\r\naws secretsmanager create-secret --name \"Context\" --secret-string '{ \"Param\": \"value\" }'\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a flow with a Parameter Context named \"Context\" and a Parameter named \"Param\".  The flow could demonstrate the value by logging the parameter via `LogAttribute`.  Save the flow definition and launch stateless using the following configuration:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnifi.stateless.parameter.provider.AWSSecretsManager.name=AWS Secrets Manager Provider\r\nnifi.stateless.parameter.provider.AWSSecretsManager.type=org.apache.nifi.stateless.parameter.AwsSecretsManagerParameterValueProvider\r\nnifi.stateless.parameter.provider.AWSSecretsManager.properties.aws-credentials-file=./conf/bootstrap-aws.conf\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9179 Enables the GitHub `system-tests` workflow for Pull Requests that include changes to the following modules:\r\n\r\n- nifi-api\r\n- nifi-framework-api\r\n- nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-bundle\r\n- nifi-system-tests\r\n\r\nRunning system tests for these modules provides additional verification for changes to these foundational modules. Pull Requests that include changes to these modules will run both the standard continuous integration workflow as well as the system tests.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-14T15:05:44Z","updated_at":"2021-09-18T13:03:05Z","closed_at":"2021-09-18T13:03:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5696a5e510420f1c8e4ac2962a50a46d59e721d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5389/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5389/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5389/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/533f9e2ae3870839737cea57c887c744991642f0","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-9179","ref":"NIFI-9179","sha":"533f9e2ae3870839737cea57c887c744991642f0","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9184 Refactors shared methods for Base64 encoding and client status handling in the following Sensitive Property Providers:\r\n\r\n- AWS KMS\r\n- Azure Key Vault Key\r\n- GCP KMS\r\n\r\nChanges include abstracting client initialization to a `ClientProvider` interface with a shared method for reading client properties from a referenced configuration file. Abstracting client initialization provided the opportunity to introduced unit tests for AWS KMS and Azure Key Vault Key providers. the GCP `KeyManagementServiceClient` does not implement an interface and has methods marked as `final`, which does not lend itself to mocked unit testing.\r\n\r\nThe client initialization approach in `BoostrapPropertiesClientProvider` checks for the presence of the specified path property as well as the existence of the referenced properties file. As multiple Sensitive Property Provider implementations are not designed to be used together, commenting out the referenced configuration file properties in the default `bootstrap.conf` provides a better approach to the default system configuration.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8749 Removes implicit time zone conversion to GMT when parsing dates and times from strings to objects. This addresses a latent issue in `DataTypeUtils.getDateFormat()` leading to unexpected behavior in record-oriented components and other date parsing capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis pull request includes the same commit as #5305 with additional changes to `TestRecordPath` using an static value for `user.timezone`. Using a static `user.timezone` value in `TestRecordPath` avoids localized build failures where the system time zone causes test failures in time zone conversion. This addresses the issue described in NIFI-9187.\r\n\r\nRemoving the implicit conversion to GMT restores standard behavior where NiFi handles date parsing according to the system default time zone. This has no impact when parsing timestamps containing an explicit time zone, but addresses issues in components such as `PutDatabaseRecord` when parsing timestamps without a time zone indicator in the string.\r\n\r\nThe current Expression Language Guide indicates that both the `format` and `toDate` functions default to the local time zone when the second argument is not specified. The Record Path Guide previously indicated a default time zone of GMT for the `toDate` function, reflecting the actual behavior when support for a time zone argument was introduced. Recent updates to PutDatabaseRecord in NIFI-8223, released in NiFi 1.13.0, surfaced this implicit conversion issue when handling timestamp inputs from Record Readers.\r\n\r\nChanges include replacing the GMT Time Zone in `DataTypeUtils.getDateFormat()` with the explicit default of `TimeZone.getDefault()`. Additional updates include unit test adjustments in order to conform expected values to meet the corrected behavior.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Objects from _nifi-core_ can be injected by spring web context. Since only a single _NiFiServer_ instance can be accessed in _BootstrapListener_, I extended it with a new method that returns the status history.\r\n\r\n- Outsourced _StatusHistoryRepository_ creation to a factory bean from _FlowController_ in order to use it in _nifi-runtime_.\r\n- The _NiFiServer_ interface has been extended with the _String getNodeStatusHistoryJson(final int days);_ method. (Returns a string in order to avoid additional dependencies in nifi-bootstrap. Dependencies in nifi-runtime affect nifi-bootstrap as well, and they must be added to assembly/common.xml filters.)\r\n- Extended _RunNiFi_ and _nifi.sh_ with the new status-history option.\r\n- The StatusHistoryRepository gets injected into JettyServer which can be accessed by NiFiBootstrap.\r\n\r\n**Still under consideration or work in progress:**\r\n\r\n- NiFiServer: default vs not default method?\r\n- Extend admin guide\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9183\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9049 Replaces browser-based persistence of JSON Web Tokens in `localStorage` with a new `nf.AuthorizationStorage` component based on `sessionStorage`.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation relies on persisting an expiration timestamp along with the JSON Web Token, but the `localStorage` entry remains in the browser across multiple tabs and browser restarts. With the introduction of HTTP Session Cookies in #4988, this can result in the browser retaining the token in `localStorage` after the browser has removed the HTTP Session Cookie. This mismatch of persistence lifespan results in NiFi allowing access to the user interface, but denying access when open custom UI extensions of viewing provenance data content. Those user interface requests require the presence of the HTTP Session Cookie for access.\r\n\r\nChanging the persistent storage approach ensures that both the HTTP Session Cookie and the `sessionStorage` contents will be removed when restarting the browser.\r\n\r\nChanges in this Pull Request also include checking for the existence of the `Authorization` header in `AccessResource.getAccessStatus()`, and instructing the browser to remove the Session Cookie when the `Authorization` header is missing. Updating the `nf-canvas.js` loading process to call `getAccessStatus()` ensures that both the HTTP Session Cookie and the JSON Web Token from `sessionStorage` are present. This addresses scenarios where the browser may have the Session Cookie, but not have the token, which then redirects the browser to the login screen.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9082 Adds `nifi.zookeeper.jute.maxbuffer` as a configurable setting in `nifi.properties` for `ZooKeeperStateProvider` and ZooKeeper clustering. The default value is just under 1 MB based on the default value of `1048575` bytes described in the [ZooKeeper Administrator's Guide](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.5.9/zookeeperAdmin.html#Unsafe+Options). This default value aligns with the current hard-coded data size limit of 1 MB defined in `ZooKeeperStateProvider`.\r\n\r\nAlthough the default value applies to the majority of use cases, and increasing the value can have other performance impacts, ZooKeeper supports larger values. Introducing this configurable property in NiFi supports optional configuration of a larger buffer in conjunction with changing the property on ZooKeeper servers.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9060 Refactors HTTP cookie processing to improve integration when running NiFi behind a reverse proxy server. The `nifi.web.proxy.context.path` property provides the option for NiFi to accept forwarded context paths using HTTP headers such as `X-ProxyContextPath`. Instead of using the hard-coded root path `/` for HTTP cookies, the new `ApplicationCookieService` interface and implementation support setting the path based on the proxy header when provided.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include adjusting the prefix of the `Authorization-Bearer` cookie name from `__Host-` to `__Secure-`.  The [__Host-](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis#section-4.1.3.2) prefix requires the cookie `Path` property set to `/`, necessitating the change to [__Secure-](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis#section-4.1.3.1) in order to support different path values.  The `__Secure-` prefix works in conjunction with the `Secure` property to ensure that the client will only send the cookie over HTTPS.\r\n\r\nSeveral login and logout JavaScript functions included hard-coded `window.location` redirects to `/nifi`, which did not function correctly when running behind a reverse proxy server.  Other functions use the `../nifi/` path, which works in both reverse proxy and standard configurations, and also avoids unnecessary redirects from `/nifi` to `/nifi/`.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Also, the XSD schema is now optional. If the schema is not provided, basic validation is performed simply to ensure the XML is well-formed. Documentation was updated to include sample XSD and XML. Unit tests cover various combinations of content vs. attribute, schema vs. no schema, and valid/invalid XML.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [X] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9067 Upgrades JAXB Runtime dependencies from 2.3.0 to 2.3.5 and also upgrades the JAXB API dependency from 2.3.0 to 2.3.3. This update resolves the following warning when running NiFi, NiFi Stateless, NiFi Toolkit, or MiNiFi on Java 11:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIllegal reflective access by com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.reflect.opt.Injector\r\n```\r\nUpgrading versions also involves migrating to the currently maintained Maven packages. The JAXB API Maven coordinates are now `jakarta.xml.bind:jakarta.xml.bind-api` instead of `javax.xml.bind:jaxb-api`. The JAXB implementation is now packaged as `org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime`. The JAXB API package has a transitive dependency on `jakarta.activation-api`, so explicit declaration in multiple locations is no longer necessary. Updates include indicating the new Maven coordinates and associated licenses in the NiFi assembly notices.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [X] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-19T22:49:58Z","updated_at":"2021-09-07T17:28:41Z","closed_at":"2021-09-07T17:28:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9e2967f9eb65d2f80637d943dacd3a6087fea60c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5320/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5320/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5320/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/d2a8858bb23e579fc33562bc5fafc0254d41dc38","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-9067","ref":"NIFI-9067","sha":"d2a8858bb23e579fc33562bc5fafc0254d41dc38","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9059 Updates the NiFi Stateless assembly and associated system test module to include the dependencies required for running on Java 11. The Stateless configuration expects these dependencies to exist under a directory named `java11`, but the current assembly and system test modules do not include the required dependencies.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

If an attribute exists with any (even as an empty string) value, the value shall remain the same in the result of the AttributesToJSON processor. This PR fixes the description by removing the empty conditional.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-4692\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

This makes the functionality of the processor inconsistent. \"Include Core Attributes\" should not filter out specifically listed attributes in the \"Attributes List\" property, and this PR removes this filtering.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9058\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [X] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [X] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9040 Adds a GitHub Workflow to run integration tests in the `nifi-system-test-suite` module on a daily schedule. The workflow configuration runs on Ubuntu Java 11 and MacOS Java 8. The current integration tests fail on Windows, so separate work is necessary to evaluate potential changes for the Windows platform.\r\n\r\nRunning the integration tests on a daily basis using the default `main` branch provides additional automated verification without burdening the existing pull request workflow.\r\n\r\nIn order to optimize the job and avoid running unnecessary tests, the workflow runs two Maven commands. The first command builds the modules required for `nifi-system-test-suite`:\r\n\r\n`mvn -V -nsu -ntp -ff install -D skipTests -am -pl nifi-system-tests/nifi-system-test-suite`\r\n\r\nThe second command runs the integration tests:\r\n\r\n`mvn -V -nsu -ntp -ff package verify -P integration-tests -pl nifi-system-tests/nifi-system-test-suite`\r\n\r\nThe following GitHub Actions link provides an example workflow run:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi/actions/runs/1140278748\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

This is done by using a maven property option: -DexcludeMinifi, -DexcludeNiFiRegistry and/or -DexcludeNiFiToolkit. The absence of the property will result in default behavior, i.e. the module will be included in the build.\r\nNo unit tests are included, but separate builds were run using each of the three properties or combinations of them to verify expected behavior.\r\n\r\nThis PR was re-submitted because the linkage between JIRA and the original PR was broken.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-16T16:47:22Z","updated_at":"2023-07-29T15:53:52Z","closed_at":"2021-10-29T12:11:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"99c4c670e83d9ca6c7e2fe3b27e67a54fde85784","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5307/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5307/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5307/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/6d544dfec43d587f7b6b80cb75aabdd2bf04d2ca","head":{"label":"markobean:NIFI-8917","ref":"NIFI-8917","sha":"6d544dfec43d587f7b6b80cb75aabdd2bf04d2ca","user":{"login":"markobean","id":16822728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODIyNzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16822728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean","html_url":"https://github.com/markobean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58890087,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODg5MDA4Nw==","name":"nifi","full_name":"markobean/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"markobean","id":16822728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODIyNzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16822728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean","html_url":"https://github.com/markobean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/markobean/nifi","description":"Mirror
