To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix the problem that RocksStateKeysAndNamespaceIterator would return duplicate data\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added the logic of filtering the same keyAndNamespace to the next method of RocksStateKeysAndNamespaceIterator\r\n- add unit test for the case that with MapState and update userKey multiple times under the same key\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded test that validates that duplicate data could be filtered in `testIteratorUpdateMapStateMultipleTimes`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no /)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: ( no )\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: ( no )\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?  no)\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-20T06:51:13Z","updated_at":"2021-11-05T02:59:33Z","closed_at":"2021-11-05T02:59:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f9ae40865b444ec131156c64b220cafb8de35a78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273319732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzE5NzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/StateBackends","name":"component=Runtime/StateBackends","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1613356865,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjEzMzU2ODY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/StateProcessor","name":"component=API/StateProcessor","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17525/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17525/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17525/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/7b2d7fd81dec029364a88670c0edd1207b756295","head":{"label":"mayuehappy:fix-keysAndNamespaceIterator","ref":"fix-keysAndNamespaceIterator","sha":"7b2d7fd81dec029364a88670c0edd1207b756295","user":{"login":"mayuehappy","id":13551348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTUxMzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13551348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy","html_url":"https://github.com/mayuehappy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":376075275,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzYwNzUyNzU=","name":"flink","full_name":"mayuehappy/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mayuehappy","id":13551348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTUxMzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13551348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy","html_url":"https://github.com/mayuehappy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayuehappy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mayuehappy/flink","description":"Apache

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-19T21:25:59Z","updated_at":"2023-01-10T23:30:49Z","closed_at":"2023-01-10T23:30:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"02b851566ad3ec08689c320acdfd61022cf2dd2f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17524/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17524/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17524/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/fbe360124a6e29ed8059246acc6a261f53b5448b","head":{"label":"mHz28:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"fbe360124a6e29ed8059246acc6a261f53b5448b","user":{"login":"mHz28","id":14156961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTU2OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14156961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28","html_url":"https://github.com/mHz28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":419094746,"node_id":"R_kgDOGPrg2g","name":"flink","full_name":"mHz28/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mHz28","id":14156961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTU2OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14156961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28","html_url":"https://github.com/mHz28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mHz28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mHz28/flink","description":"Apache

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to add new interfaces to reorganize the casting throughout the Table API implementation.\r\n\r\nThe new interface called `CastRule` provides a flexible way to implement casting logic for different input and target `LogicalType`s. `CastRule` encapsulates the casting logic and its matching logic, which could be a match of one or multiple input and target types, type families or a custom predicate.\r\n\r\nA subinterface of `CastRule` called `CodeGeneratorCastRule` allows to implement casting through code generation, in order to retain the same performance characteristics we have in our code generator, but unifying the code base and improving the code organization. A default implementation to create an executable version of the casting logic is provided through janino `ExpressionEvaluator` feature.\r\n\r\nHaving both a \"callable\" casting rule and a \"code generating\" cast rule allows us to:\r\n\r\n* Improve code generation codebase quality\r\n* Reuse the same to string casting logic in `PrintUtils`\r\n* Allow us in future to fix the constant folding for casting (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-24588 for more details)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduce the new interfaces `CastRule`, `CastExecutor`, `CodeGeneratorCastRule` and relative subinterfaces/base classes\r\n- Provide a `CastRuleProvider` to discover cast rules\r\n- Wired the new cast rules to the code generation\r\n- Added a couple of rules to show how to implement them\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nA new test `CastRulesTest` is added to unit test the cast rules. The e2e tests are provided by `CastFunctionITCase`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? no\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-19T12:56:42Z","updated_at":"2021-10-29T08:37:36Z","closed_at":"2021-10-29T08:30:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bfb78e31bc332fa9abecc695abfa54c4a756c25d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17522/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17522/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17522/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/ec3a0972e352ea5439c09043cc0c02a91c063cc2","head":{"label":"slinkydeveloper:FLINK-24462","ref":"FLINK-24462","sha":"ec3a0972e352ea5439c09043cc0c02a91c063cc2","user":{"login":"slinkydeveloper","id":6706544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDY1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6706544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper","html_url":"https://github.com/slinkydeveloper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":403633406,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDM2MzM0MDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"slinkydeveloper/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"slinkydeveloper","id":6706544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDY1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6706544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper","html_url":"https://github.com/slinkydeveloper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/slinkydeveloper/flink","description":"Apache

to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n make server side classLoader which create by BloblibraryCacheManager.DefaultClassLoaderFactory pluggable in able to make the parent classloader of  ChildFirstClassLoader variable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - add a new interface `ClassLoaderFactoryBuilder` which can be extensible by user，the instance of `ClassLoaderFactoryBuilder` is instantiable by ServiceLoader \r\n  - add loading phase in `DefaultClassLoaderFactory` , if a customize `ClassLoaderFactoryBuilder` instance can be loaded by ServiceLoader ,then the class loading applies will delegate to it.  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-19T11:59:02Z","updated_at":"2022-11-11T15:39:10Z","closed_at":"2022-11-11T15:39:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bbbacbec868d3c80a854205135fb8ed2126c789f","assignee":{"login":"AHeise","id":4559103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTkxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4559103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise","html_url":"https://github.com/AHeise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"AHeise","id":4559103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTkxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4559103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise","html_url":"https://github.com/AHeise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273239272,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMjM5Mjcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=CommandLineClient","name":"component=CommandLineClient","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17521/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17521/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17521/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/5c3e94d6e67f9b784bddb8770bbc2b519a0ec6d3","head":{"label":"baisui1981:master","ref":"master","sha":"5c3e94d6e67f9b784bddb8770bbc2b519a0ec6d3","user":{"login":"baisui1981","id":21274618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjc0NjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21274618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baisui1981","html_url":"https://github.com/baisui1981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baisui1981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baisui1981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baisui1981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baisui1981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baisui1981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baisui1981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baisui1981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baisui1981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baisui1981/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":418869124,"node_id":"R_kgDOGPdvhA","name":"flink","full_name":"baisui1981/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"baisui1981","id":21274618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjc0NjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githu

slinkydeveloper <francescoguard@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR ports `TestRowDataCsvInputFormat` to `DeserializationSchemaFactory`, part of the effort https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-19845 to prune `FileSystemFormatFactory`. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Ported `TestRowDataCsvInputFormat` to `DeserializationSchemaFactory`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is in the test code and is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-19T07:00:34Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T18:04:52Z","closed_at":"2021-10-22T06:18:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f7ebd27c22bb7d6a8234493401acbba0b78b79ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1291537903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkxNTM3OTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Runtime","name":"component=TableSQL/Runtime","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17515/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17515/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17515/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d7c1fcc67b1a7905b29506234c71139b0744e606","head":{"label":"slinkydeveloper:FLINK-24575","ref":"FLINK-24575","sha":"d7c1fcc67b1a7905b29506234c71139b0744e606","user":{"login":"slinkydeveloper","id":6706544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDY1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6706544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper","html_url":"https://github.com/slinkydeveloper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":403633406,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDM2MzM0MDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"slinkydeveloper/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"slinkydeveloper","id":6706544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDY1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6706544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper","html_url":"https://github.com/slinkydeveloper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/slinkydeveloper/flink","description":"Apache

`uname -i` to `uname -m` for mac OS, for avoiding problem when we test on ARM\r\n\r\nAffected JIRA: FLINK-24581\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nDue to `uname -i` will fail on MAC OS, but not on other linux-based OS. So we need to use `uname -m` to avoid this problem\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-19T01:12:54Z","updated_at":"2022-03-21T02:56:42Z","closed_at":"2022-03-21T02:56:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bf67b32ede2bf6446591df74cbfcb432329f3ea8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17514/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17514/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17514/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/7abdb0e5a8cd5b28e56d0bae5095197b95be819f","head":{"label":"bzhaoopenstack:master","ref":"master","sha":"7abdb0e5a8cd5b28e56d0bae5095197b95be819f","user":{"login":"bzhaoopenstack","id":11386522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzg2NTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11386522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack","html_url":"https://github.com/bzhaoopenstack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":406681532,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDY2ODE1MzI=","name":"flink","full_name":"bzhaoopenstack/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bzhaoopenstack","id":11386522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzg2NTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11386522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack","html_url":"https://github.com/bzhaoopenstack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bzhaoopenstack/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n### Problem description\r\n\r\nAfter recover from savepoint or checkpoint, unexpected behavior of cumulate window aggregate for late event may happened.\r\n\r\n### Bug analyze\r\n\r\nCurrently, for cumulate window aggregate, late events belongs to the cleaned slice would be merged into the merged window state, and would be counted into the later slice.\r\n\r\nFor example, for a CUMULATE window, step is 1 minute, size is 1 day.\r\n\r\nSELECT window_start, window_end, COUNT(USER_ID)\r\n  FROM TABLE(\r\n    CUMULATE(TABLE Bid, DESCRIPTOR(bidtime), INTERVAL '1' MINUTES, INTERVAL '1' DAY))\r\n  GROUP BY window_start, window_end;\r\nWhen the watermark already comes to 11:01, result of window [00:00, 11:01) would be emitted. Let's assume the result is INSERT (00:00, 11:01, 4)\r\n\r\nThen if a late record which event time is 11:00 comes, it would be merged into merged state, and would be counted into the later slice, for example, for window [00:00, 11:02), [00:00, 11:03)... But the emitted window result INSERT (00:00, 11:01, 4) would not be retracted and updated.\r\n\r\nThe behavior would be different if the job recover from savepoint/checkpoint.\r\n\r\nLet's do a savepoint after watermark comes to 11:01 and emit (00:00, 11:01, 4).\r\n\r\nThen recover the job from savepoint. Watermarks are not checkpointed and they need to be repopulated again. So after recovered, the watermark may rollback to 11:00, then if a record which event time is 11:00 comes, it would not be processed as late event, after watermark comes to 11:01 again, a window result INSERT (00:00, 11:01, 5)  would be emitted to downstream.\r\n\r\nSo the downstream operator would receive two INSERT record for WINDOW (00:00, 11:01) which may leads to wrong result.\r\n\r\n This pull request aims to solve the problem by storing window progress into state in order to check whether an input event is late or not.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add  OperatorState in `SlicingWindowOperator` to store watermark\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n  - Update UT in `SlicingWindowAggOperatorTest#testEventTimeCumulativeWindows` to check the late event would still be processed as late event even if the job is restored from savepoint.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-18T08:01:35Z","updated_at":"2021-11-20T11:22:10Z","closed_at":"2021-11-14T13:24:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dff8d7a64200a03ebf0e15c560ff42ab3b1cd20b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17508/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17508/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17508/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0bf509b5cfdb5f035d72539c07d7443aa55e181e","head":{"label":"MonsterChenzhuo:flink_dev1","ref":"flink_dev1","sha":"0bf509b5cfdb5f035d72539c07d7443aa55e181e","user":{"login":"MonsterChenzhuo","id":60029759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDI5NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60029759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo","html_url":"https://github.com/MonsterChenzhuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":359701695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTk3MDE2OTU=","name":"flink","full_name":"MonsterChenzhuo/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MonsterChenzhuo","id":60029759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDI5NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60029759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo","html_url":"https://github.com/MonsterChenzhuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MonsterChenzhuo/flink","description":"Apache

source code-20200309\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-18T03:33:54Z","updated_at":"2021-10-18T03:37:21Z","closed_at":"2021-10-18T03:36:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c8098dea80418b1c8f1ac8d512ff13fb78e522f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17507/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17507/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17507/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/3fc20c43eb077b76e70c42b2099a9864b5c8783e","head":{"label":"shenshijie:master","ref":"master","sha":"3fc20c43eb077b76e70c42b2099a9864b5c8783e","user":{"login":"shenshijie","id":25789063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzg5MDYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25789063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenshijie","html_url":"https://github.com/shenshijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenshijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenshijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenshijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenshijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenshijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenshijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenshijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenshijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenshijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"fe59485be2ae2b576cbd252e78cc6f0d36ce090b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMisprint \r\nidentifer => identifier in types.md\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Fix ZooKeeperLeaderElectionTest.testLeaderShouldBeCorrectedWhenOverwritten fails with NPE*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Use a local function variable to store the value polled from leaderEventQueue in CommonTestUtils.waitUntilCondition lambda in case instance field changes*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Use old ZooKeeperLeaderElectionTest.testLeaderShouldBeCorrectedWhenOverwritten unit test*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-15T16:20:22Z","updated_at":"2022-03-11T10:57:44Z","closed_at":"2022-03-11T10:57:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2bddab8edfe0e540cb178673bb77885ea4a0c757","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17502/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17502/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17502/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8b1933c7d2fe2fdb057c71596cb742ba555f9254","head":{"label":"xmarker:master_24538","ref":"master_24538","sha":"8b1933c7d2fe2fdb057c71596cb742ba555f9254","user":{"login":"xmarker","id":13900636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTAwNjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13900636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker","html_url":"https://github.com/xmarker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":302679241,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDI2NzkyNDE=","name":"flink","full_name":"xmarker/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xmarker","id":13900636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTAwNjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13900636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker","html_url":"https://github.com/xmarker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmarker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xmarker/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to provide AvroParquetRecordFormat implementation to read avro GenericRecords from parquet via the new Flink FileSource. \r\n\r\nAnother goal of this PR is to make everyone on the same page w.r.t. the implementation design. Once the design is settled down, the splitting support and more avro record types beyond the GenericRecord as new features will be easily done in a follow-up PRs.\r\n\r\nThis is the draft PR, there is one failed unit test case, which is documented out for now with TODO comment. I am still working on it.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Create RecordFormat interface which focuses on Path with default methods implementation and delegate createReader() calls to the overloaded methods from StreamFormat that focuses on FDDataInputStream.\r\n- Create AvroParquetRecordFormat implementation. Only reading avro GenericRecord from parquet file or stream is supported in this version. Support for other avro record types will be implemented later.\r\n- Splitting is not supported in this version. \r\n\r\n## Open Questions\r\n\r\nTo give you some background, the original idea was to let AvroParquetRecordFormat implement FileRecordFormat. After considering that FileRecordFormat and StreamFormat have too many commons and StreamFormat has more built-in features like compression support(via StreamFormatAdapter), current design is based on StreamFormat. In order to keep SIP clear, 2-levels interfaces have been defined.  Let StreamFormat focuses on the abstract input stream and let RecordFormat pay attention to the concrete FileSystem, i.e. the Path. RecordFormat provides default implementation for the overloaded createReader(...) methods. Subclasses are therefore not forced to implement them.\r\n\r\nFollowing are some questions open for discussion:\r\n\r\n1. Compare to the 2-levels interfaces design, as another option, all default methods implemented in the RecordFormat could be merged into the StreamFormat. Such design keeps all createReader(...) methods in one interface(StreamFormat only, no more RecordFormat) that is in some ways easier to use. The downside is the SIP violation. Based on these consideration, I chose the current 2-levels API design.\r\n2. After considering priorities, Splitting is currently not supported, since we didn't get strong requirement from the business side. It will be implemented later, when the time comes.\r\n3. If this design works well, as next step, we should consider replacing the FileRecordFormat with the RecordFormat. In this way, the duplicated code and javacode could be avoided. This question is a little bit out of the scope of this PR, but does relate to the topic, could be therefore discussed too.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  New unit test validates that : \r\n- Reader can be created and restored correctly via Path.\r\n- Violation constraint checks for no splitting, null path, and no restoreOffset are working well.\r\n- GenericRecords can be read correctly from parquet file.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*According to the experience of other frameworks, snappy compression is recommended by default, which will reduce the file size.This does not affect reading, because these formats will automatically uncompress the file according to the head information of the file.  Parquet, orc and.avro format could define the default of the compression codec as the snappy compression.*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Update the `AvroFormatOptions`, `OrcBulkWriterFactory` and `ParquetRowDataBuilder` for the change of the default compression to snappy.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - *Update the `AvroFilesystemITCase` and `OrcFileSystemITCase` to verify whether the default compression could change to snappy.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe affected test was written due to a 64kB compilation issue. While that issue is fixed, there seems to be a limitation in Janino that can trigger a false-positive stack overflow. We reduce the number of fields in the test to workaround this issue; 500 fields is still plenty for the time being.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed

PR adds a generator for an experimental OpenAPI specification for the REST API. This can be used to generate clients in various languages.\r\n\r\nThe spec is mostly generated from our `MessageHeaders`, with some tweaks where necessary. Most of it should be correct, but there may be bugs, particularly for the more special endpoints (e.g., those accepting file uploads).\r\nTo generate the spec we use `swagger`.\r\n\r\nIn order for swagger to pick up our jackson annotations we need a flink-shaded version of swagger that relocates jackson. See [this](https://github.com/apache/flink-shaded/pull/102) flink-shaded draft. This means that CI _will not pass_.\r\n\r\nI had to add annotations to the `AsynchronousOperationResult` because swagger noticed these getters; it's just a difference in behavior to our current schema generator (which we could eventually remove).\r\n\r\nThe specification is currently only exposed through the documentation, but in the future we can think of exposing it from the cluster as well (its just a matter of bundling the generated file in

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-15T03:03:00Z","updated_at":"2021-12-13T05:54:41Z","closed_at":"2021-12-13T05:54:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ae392d4a8d943d45720094c64b0e0b08b025c59f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17489/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17489/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17489/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a541a03d3313256f0a8326593085e50fcd292add","head":{"label":"zuston:master","ref":"master","sha":"a541a03d3313256f0a8326593085e50fcd292add","user":{"login":"zuston","id":8609142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MDkxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8609142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston","html_url":"https://github.com/zuston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":266698871,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjY2OTg4NzE=","name":"flink","full_name":"zuston/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zuston","id":8609142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MDkxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8609142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston","html_url":"https://github.com/zuston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zuston/flink","description":"Apache

PR adds two new high availability services `ZooKeeperMultipleComponentLeaderElectionHaServices` and `KuberntesMultipleComponentLeaderElectionHaServices` that only use a single leader election per process. Both services internally rely on the `DefaultMultipleComponentLeaderElectionService` that uses a single `MultipleComponentLeaderElectionDriver` (responsible for the leader election) and allows to register multiple components. All components either obtain together the leadership or lose it together.\r\n\r\nFor the `MultipleComponentLeaderElectionDriver`, there are two implementations `ZooKeeperMultipleComponentLeaderElectionDriver` and the `KubernetesMultipleComponentLeaderElectionDriver` that implement the leader election based on ZooKeeper and Kubernetes, respectively.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the old ha services implementation for safety purposes (users can switch back by setting `high-availability.use-old-ha-services: true`), I have reused the `DefaultLeaderElectionService` implementation and introduced a `MultipleComponentLeaderElectionDriverAdapter` that internally registers a component at the `MultipleComponentLeaderElectionService`. Once we remove the old HA service implementations I think that we can remove these temporary bridges and simplify the `DefaultLeaderElectionService` implementation to directly work against the `MultipleComponentLeaderElectionService`.","created_at":"2021-10-14T12:32:48Z","updated_at":"2022-01-26T22:53:28Z","closed_at":"2022-01-26T22:52:22Z","merged_at":"2022-01-26T22:52:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"fef375e571ef62c42e7df2f517452e37ed9c8563","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17485/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17485/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17485/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/fef375e571ef62c42e7df2f517452e37ed9c8563","head":{"label":"tillrohrmann:singleLeaderElection","ref":"singleLeaderElection","sha":"fef375e571ef62c42e7df2f517452e37ed9c8563","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20681108,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY4MTEwOA==","name":"flink","full_name":"tillrohrmann/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann/flink","description":"Mirror

channels in order to avoid miscalculation in case of channel data skew\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This PR removes the limitation of 1 buffer in use per channel*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *SingleInputGate#getBuffersInUseCount can return zero buffers if there are no buffers in channels*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added new test to SingleInputGateTest*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-14T09:18:26Z","updated_at":"2021-10-15T03:57:34Z","closed_at":"2021-10-14T09:29:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17477/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17477/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17477/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a58dd487c99c832059871d1bea54ec16fc7e3a93","head":{"label":"open-botech:release-1.14","ref":"release-1.14","sha":"a58dd487c99c832059871d1bea54ec16fc7e3a93","user":{"login":"open-botech","id":88819203,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg4ODE5MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88819203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech","html_url":"https://github.com/open-botech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":395319472,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTUzMTk0NzI=","name":"flink","full_name":"open-botech/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"open-botech","id":88819203,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg4ODE5MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88819203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech","html_url":"https://github.com/open-botech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/open-botech/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-14T09:13:45Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T09:29:43Z","closed_at":"2021-10-14T09:29:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17476/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17476/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17476/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/7f21c075f38d879e5ccbaaa5703184b294d725e2","head":{"label":"open-botech:caotian-flink14","ref":"caotian-flink14","sha":"7f21c075f38d879e5ccbaaa5703184b294d725e2","user":{"login":"open-botech","id":88819203,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg4ODE5MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88819203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech","html_url":"https://github.com/open-botech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":395319472,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTUzMTk0NzI=","name":"flink","full_name":"open-botech/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"open-botech","id":88819203,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg4ODE5MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88819203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech","html_url":"https://github.com/open-botech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-botech/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/open-botech/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe RocksIteratorWrapper is a wrapper of RocksIterator to do additional status check for all the methods. However, there's a typo that RocksIteratorWrapper.seekToLast() method calls RocksIterator's seekToFirst(), which is obviously wrong. I guess this issue wasn't found before as it was only referenced in the RocksTransformingIteratorWrapper.seekToLast() method and nowhere else.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Replace the iterator.seekToFirst() to the iterator.seekToLast() in the seekToLast method;*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the EMA from the throughput calculation to buffer size caclculation\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n  - *Removed EMA for the throughput*\r\n  - *Added EMA for the buffer size calcualtion*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-14T07:57:14Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T12:18:58Z","closed_at":"2021-10-28T12:18:57Z","merged_at":"2021-10-28T12:18:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"76b9e1471eb2390108f664d9c0843ee39b4b985f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17473/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17473/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17473/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/5ebbdaaeb0298f6ce2a0d2ba20460d4e85509207","head":{"label":"akalash:flink-24470","ref":"flink-24470","sha":"5ebbdaaeb0298f6ce2a0d2ba20460d4e85509207","user":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344520862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ1MjA4NjI=","name":"flink","full_name":"akalash/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/akalash/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThe goal is to fix the possibility to disable buffer timeout for pipelined exchanges. It has been broken in #13209, which was supposed to add a check that buffer timeout is properly configured if blocking exchanges are present in the graph.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* treat -1 again as a valid configuration instead of `UNDEFINED`\r\n* it disables the automatic disabling of buffer timeout for blocking exchanges\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nTests in `StreamingJobGraphGeneratorTest` work. I also added `org.apache.flink.streaming.api.graph.StreamingJobGraphGeneratorTest#testDisablingBufferTimeoutWithPipelinedExchanges` to verify we can disable buffer timeout for pipelined exchanges.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request is to update the flink avro and json schema serializer / deserializer with the latest AWS Glue Schema Registry version v1.1.5*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Update Glue Schema Registry with the lastest version*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-13T21:43:34Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T18:05:03Z","closed_at":"2021-10-18T07:25:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"615fcea847685661568d2198aec330358aa91f3c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1274303759,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc0MzAzNzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Formats","name":"component=Formats","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17466/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17466/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17466/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/5126c857d00a33ed34a3b1a8b610b89e4e9193d7","head":{"label":"LinyuYao1021:master","ref":"master","sha":"5126c857d00a33ed34a3b1a8b610b89e4e9193d7","user":{"login":"LinyuYao1021","id":71672182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjcyMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71672182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021","html_url":"https://github.com/LinyuYao1021","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":416897828,"node_id":"R_kgDOGNlbJA","name":"flink","full_name":"LinyuYao1021/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LinyuYao1021","id":71672182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjcyMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71672182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021","html_url":"https://github.com/LinyuYao1021","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinyuYao1021/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LinyuYao1021/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Correct typos in docs of code files*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Correct typos in docs of code files, mainly for the 'the the'*\r\n  - *Other minor syntax typos.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*Pure docs typos*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis patch resolves [FLINK-24503](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues/FLINK-24503).\r\n\r\nThis patch aims to improve security of Flink native Kubernetes deployment on vendor k8s cluster as the original `kubernetes.rest-service.exposed.type` defaults `LoadBalancer` results in REST API and web UI exposed to the wild Internet if the developer forgets or fails to override the defaults.\r\n\r\nThis is a impact-limited breaking change that should be noted.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* `kubernetes.rest-service.exposed.type` defaults is now `ClusterIP` instead of `LoadBalancer`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as:\r\n\r\n* `ExternalServiceDecoratorTest.testBuildAccompanyingKubernetesResources:82`\r\n* `KubernetesJobManagerFactoryTest.testServices:297`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes, it is `org.apache.flink.kubernetes.configuration.KubernetesConfigOptions`\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: yes, it is Kubernetes.\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?  no.\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? N/A\r\n\r\nI see there seems to exist a doc generation mechanism relying on `src/main/java/org/apache/flink/kubernetes/configuration/KubernetesConfigOptions.java`, so I guess the generated docs are updated automaticly. Please correct me if I missed something.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-13T05:11:38Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T02:34:24Z","closed_at":"2021-10-14T02:34:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"66798d719cdadcc8b0abba0c7a615f9f811a827a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1278776326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc2MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/Kubernetes","name":"component=Deployment/Kubernetes","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17461/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17461/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17461/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1849ac1dd585c914d4a294b130cbb3df107353f9","head":{"label":"nanmu42:master","ref":"master","sha":"1849ac1dd585c914d4a294b130cbb3df107353f9","user":{"login":"nanmu42","id":8143068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNDMwNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8143068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanmu42","html_url":"https://github.com/nanmu42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanmu42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanmu42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanmu42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanmu42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanmu42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanmu42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanmu42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanmu42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nanmu42/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"58197bebb554df7df1dd3dc27cc3e71cc3ad5b49","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe TableSchema has been deprecated for a while now unfortunately many of our connectors still use it. This PR tries to address it and migrates the connectors to the new stack. (Schema/ResolvedSchema)\r\n\r\nI'll create a follow-up ticket to do the same for the hive connector because it has some additional complexity. The only other connector which is missing is elasticsearch where we will address the TableSchema usage as part of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-24323\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Migrate TableSchema usages and remove outdated table connector code (Hbase, Kafka, Jdbc)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- All existing tests still pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-12T13:07:35Z","updated_at":"2021-10-20T08:15:21Z","closed_at":"2021-10-20T08:15:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b8e599999d392088f6f9c62587d37d4588e28bc2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273210700,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMjEwNzAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Common","name":"component=Connectors/Common","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17459/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17459/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17459/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0a7a93b33cebac710002818515ba9cec493c6dc2","head":{"label":"fapaul:FLINK-24397-wh","ref":"FLINK-24397-wh","sha":"0a7a93b33cebac710002818515ba9cec493c6dc2","user":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":246338488,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDYzMzg0ODg=","name":"flink","full_name":"fapaul/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMoved `DecimalDataUtils` and `SqlDateTimeUtils` (renamed to `DateTimeUtils`), removing all usages of the avatica-core methods.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* `DecimalDataUtils` and `DateTimeUtils` now lives in table-common\r\n* Copied over some missing methods from avatica-core `DateTimeUtils` to our class, including the two enums `TimeUnit` and `TimeUnitRange`\r\n* Every usage in planner and runtime of avatica-core `DateTimeUtils` has been replaced with our internal `DateTimeUtils` now in common \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n \r\n##

Fix the duplicate log output of libraries/connectors，when logback is used\r\nWhen logback is used, the logs of libraries / connectors are output repeatedly.\r\n\r\nBy default, appenders are cumulative: a logger will log to the appenders attached to itself (if any) as well as all the appenders attached to its ancestors. Thus, attaching the same appender to multiple loggers will cause logging output to be duplicated.\r\n\r\nhttp://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html#cumulative\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFLINK-24476 This pull request renames all documentation and code instances of ElasticSearch to Elasticsearch to align with their brand guidelines.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- There are no file names with an internal S\r\n- All documentation, javadoc and private methods were renamed without an internal S.\r\n- [This commit](https://github.com/RyanSkraba/flink/commit/55bbb7e7f747599b91a2926e47af4ea299a728e4) changes a class name that is technically exposed as API, but not `@Public` and clearly documented in comments for internal use only.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n`grep -r lasticSearch .` returns no results after this commit.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **yes**\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-11T07:37:38Z","updated_at":"2021-10-11T07:40:23Z","closed_at":"2021-10-11T07:40:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"30294fa9a8e26d4308f4e622a5a901acbef624d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17446/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17446/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17446/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/153f466003db8b5b11def46e1bd7f17dc48b52e8","head":{"label":"MartijnVisser:github-action","ref":"github-action","sha":"153f466003db8b5b11def46e1bd7f17dc48b52e8","user":{"login":"MartijnVisser","id":2989614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODk2MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2989614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser","html_url":"https://github.com/MartijnVisser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":380971259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODA5NzEyNTk=","name":"flink","full_name":"MartijnVisser/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MartijnVisser","id":2989614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODk2MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2989614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser","html_url":"https://github.com/MartijnVisser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MartijnVisser/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBefore, the result of the sql \"select 1 = '1'\" is false, which is wrong.  And when \"1 = '1'\" is in join conditions, it will throw an exception, instead of returning a true or false result. \r\n\r\n\"=\" should have the same behavior with \">\" and \"<\", which have the correct results. So before calcite solves this bug or Flink supports this kind of implicit type conversion, we'd better temporarily forbidding this implicit type conversion in \"=\" and \"<>\" and all throwing a clear exception, instead of giving a wrong result.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - In the codegen function, check the validity of implicit type conversion to avoid conversion between numeric and (var)char.\r\n  - According to flip-154, add many test cases to test implicit type conversion now supported.\r\n  - Change the existing test cases\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests to verify this change.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  -

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-21456 to unify the string conversion logic for the SQL data types. This PR changes the `PrintUtils` methods to make them accept only internal data types. In order to do that, several changes were required, in particular inside sql client which is mainly using external data types, but then relies heavily on `PrintUtils` for the print to screen logic. Next PRs will take care of cleaning up the logic of `PrintUtils`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduce `TableResultInternal` to expose an iterator for internal types, and use it in return types of `TableEnvironmentInternal`\r\n- Modified the collector sink in order to emit data using internal data types \r\n- Support both internal and external types in `CollectResultProvider` (renamed to `ResultProvider`)\r\n- Migrated most of the internal `Row` usages in common, api and sql client to `RowData`. No public API is affected.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by tests in table common and sql client.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper:

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This PR fixes NPE which happens when we try to use channel context inside of ClientHandler before the channel was activated*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Wait for the channel activation before creating partition request client*\r\n  - *Ignore the exception during the throughput calculation in order to avoid the failure of the further calculation*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added test for CreditBasedPartitionRequestClientHandler*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This PR fixes the situation when the newly calculated buffer size is equal to min or max possible size and it isn't announced because the diff with the previous value is less than a threshold value.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Changed the condition for the announcement of the newly calculated buffer size.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added new tests into BufferDebloaterTest*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-08T12:45:38Z","updated_at":"2021-10-12T13:52:55Z","closed_at":"2021-10-12T13:52:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"10441ba742334a9151f21e855cdb76805ab6bb3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17437/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17437/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17437/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/144e98c5abef798d7542de0002e1f4630ca3ab8f","head":{"label":"akalash:flink-24467","ref":"flink-24467","sha":"144e98c5abef798d7542de0002e1f4630ca3ab8f","user":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344520862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ1MjA4NjI=","name":"flink","full_name":"akalash/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/akalash/flink","description":"Apache

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This PR adds the buffer debloat documentation to Chinese part of the documentatioon\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Copy the english doc to Chinese part of the documentation*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-08T10:15:31Z","updated_at":"2021-10-09T01:43:16Z","closed_at":"2021-10-09T01:43:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2d2391cccdde43b1d0136786204513daf7435a96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272992952,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Network","name":"component=Runtime/Network","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17435/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17435/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17435/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c98933bfd363ec39efdc1ef5bfaaa4dd14200461","head":{"label":"akalash:flink-23458-chinese","ref":"flink-23458-chinese","sha":"c98933bfd363ec39efdc1ef5bfaaa4dd14200461","user":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344520862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ1MjA4NjI=","name":"flink","full_name":"akalash/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/akalash/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Bug fix RocksIteratorWrapper#seekToLast method*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *RocksIteratorWrapper#seekToLast method, calling RocksIterator#seekToFirst method incorrectly*\r\n  - *The RocksIteratorWrapper#seekToLast method is not currently used, so it has no impact on the flink project*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *added new unit test RocksDBRocksStateKeysIteratorTest#testSeekToLast*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is a fix being pulled back into 1.12, please see #17417 for the original PR. The following is just the original text from the previous pull request; \r\n\r\nThe EFO Kinesis connector will register and de-register stream consumers based on the [configured registration strategy](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.13/docs/connectors/datastream/kinesis/#efo-stream-consumer-registrationderegistration). When EAGER is used, the client (usually job manager) will register the consumer and then the task managers will de-register the consumer when job stops/fails. If the job is configured to restart on fail, then the consumer will not exist and the job will continuously fail over.\r\n\r\nAfter this change the connector will not trigger consumer deregistration in EFO if using the EAGER registration strategy. This will allow EAGER EFO configured connector applications to use restart policies without continuously failing. The documentation is updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add dedicated utility function for determining whether consumer deregistration is required.*\r\n  - *Ensure consumer deregistration now only occurs when EFO is configured using the LAZY registration strategy.*\r\n  - *Update the documentation to reflect the changes.* \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nParts of this change are already covered by existing tests in `org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kinesis.util.StreamConsumerRegistrarUtilTest`. \r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - *Added unit test to verify deregistration criteria i.e. `org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kinesis.util.StreamConsumerRegistrarUtilTest#testDeregisterStreamConsumersOnlyDeregistersEFOLazilyInitializedConsumers`*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a Flink application with a fixed delay restart strategy and a FlinkKinesisConsumer with EAGER EFO configured.* \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **No**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **No**\r\n  - The serializers: **No**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **No**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: **_Yes_**\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: **No**\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - References to the EAGER EFO deregistration policy have been updated in `datastream/kinesis.md` and `table/kinesis.md`.\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-07T15:17:03Z","updated_at":"2021-10-11T14:24:32Z","closed_at":"2021-10-11T14:24:32Z","merged_at":"2021-10-11T14:24:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"0f738172cf7035983ba56444b5374475c195a4cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273338726,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzM4NzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Kinesis","name":"component=Connectors/Kinesis","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17431/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17431/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17431/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/191eee54006303b07fd453ad6971cbf8a55c4b38","head":{"label":"rudikershaw:release-1.12-FLINK-24431","ref":"release-1.12-FLINK-24431","sha":"191eee54006303b07fd453ad6971cbf8a55c4b38","user":{"login":"rudikershaw","id":15424302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI0MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15424302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw","html_url":"https://github.com/rudikershaw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:release-1.12","ref":"release-1.12","sha":"1a9d78259668f3d9c1a52dd278e8502d1449f780","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache
