Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12871](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12871) Upgrades Apache Commons Compress dependencies from 1.25.0 to [1.26.1](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310904&version=12354340). \r\n\r\nThis upgrade resolves CVE-2024-26308 related to memory exhaustion for Pack200 files, which are not used directly in NiFi components.

This might lead to some confusion for new users of NiFi.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the default value, see [NIFI-12617](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12617).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHowever, accessing NiFi using `127.0.0.1` is still possible and leads to the aforementioned SNI error. \r\n\r\nI thought about including the IP address in the auto-generated certificate and disabling SNI checks whenever \"localhost\" or \"127.0.0.1\" is set as host. However, I concluded that this might accidentally weaken security for only a very marginal gain in convenience.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull

new UI incorporates Angular Material 16. This uses the material theming SASS functions to allow for creation of dark and light themes. A Material theme has a few constituent parts\r\n\r\n- Color palettes\r\n- Typography\r\n- Density\r\n\r\nThis change only is in regard to how NiFi uses the color palettes, but I’ll touch on the other pieces briefly for completeness.\r\n### Density\r\nDensity applies to the padding and spacing between components, and is only implemented on Angular components and not NiFi custom components.\r\n### Typography\r\nTypography allows for declaration of type styles. In Material, type styles are composed of the following attributes.\r\n\r\n- font-size\r\n- line-height\r\n- font-weight\r\n- font-family\r\n- letter-spacing\r\n\r\nThey can either be specified in the order above, or by name. NiFi does not currently implement typography using Angular theming.\r\n### Palettes\r\nAn Angular theme has 3 color palettes. Primary, Accent, and Warn. Primary and Accent are meant to be distinct colors, used to draw attention to important UI elements such as buttons and other form controls. The Warn palette is used to indicate errors or issues, like errors on form fields, or in NiFi’s case, things like invalid components.\r\n\r\nPalettes are organized into 10 main color values, with 4 optional alternate color values. In addition, each color value MUST be given a contrast. The contrast is often used in cases such as the text on a button.\r\n\r\nIn Material Design 10 main colors are organized by value of 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, with 50 being the lightest, and 900 being the most intense or darkest. The main color values generally have the same hue, but have stepped brightness and saturation levels.  The alternate colors are organized as A100, A200, A400, and A700. The alternate colors tend to be a small shift in hue and saturation levels, with brightness matching the corresponding main color values at 100, 200, 400, and 700 respectively.\r\n\r\nPalettes are further customized during declaration by assigning a “default”, “lighter”, and “darker” value. If they are not assigned directly, Angular will assign 500 as default, 100 as lighter, and 900 as darker. When we reference color values directly by their number, we’re ignoring any set “default”, “lighter”, or “darker” values in a palette.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that the names of the color values should have meaning in relation to each other. If color 400 doesn’t have sufficient contrast in a dark theme, then we should be able to select color 300, knowing that it will be a lighter, brighter version of the same hue, and thus improve the contrast ratio.\r\n### NiFi Material theming\r\nI would propose that we re-organize the NiFi palettes to better follow the semantics behind the numeric color values, as well as have NiFi components use “default”, “lighter”, and “darker” colors for the Material Primary, Accent, and Warn palettes as much as possible. The most notable exception would be the Warn palette and using the alternate values with a hue shift to allow for oranges and yellows in cases like invalid processors.\r\n### NiFi Canvas theming\r\nWith this change, the NiFi canvas theme is re-organized as well to match the color semantics. However, because the Canvas theme is unique in that it provides many of the values that are protected in Material theming, we can more safely reference some colors values directly. For example, NiFi Canvas Primary is the greyscale values available to be used as surface or on-surface colors in light and dark themes. This allows us to do things like assume that NiFi Canvas Primary at 500 is a midpoint between white and black, and apply it safely, like in the case of borders on the flow canvas. Or to use A200 as the color value for box-shadows.\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve the semantics for Material surfaces while using the NiFi canvas themes, I added helper functions that will pull in the semantically appropriate color values depending on whether or not the theme is a dark theme or a light theme.\r\n### Screens\r\n![Light Theme](https://github.com/apache/nifi/assets/638529/91420adc-844e-45fe-ba41-dda55ad63297)\r\n![Dark Theme](https://github.com/apache/nifi/assets/638529/6788a441-cd7a-4e3c-b8a9-e5a1587101dd)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe changes proposed here are represented on the left, with the current MAIN styling on the right. The dark themes are dramatically different, but I would argue the proposed dark theme matches the stylistic heritage of NiFi more, as well as doubling down on the “dark” aspect of dark mode.\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n#### Color reductions\r\nWhile changing the usage of color to almost exclusively use “default”, “lighter”, and “darker” it was necessary to combine some colors. In almost every case, the colors were different by only a few bits. \r\nFor example #acacac vs #aaaaaa.\r\n![AA vs AC](https://github.com/apache/nifi/assets/638529/4aba3a1e-a72d-4f16-9840-6dc357db33e2)\r\n\r\n#aabec7 vs #abbdc5\r\n![3bits](https://github.com/apache/nifi/assets/638529/7b3b4a23-45b8-435a-8af0-0c5f84fd9d9a)\r\n\r\n#### Canvas theme\r\nBy following the Material concepts of surface and on-surface, we can disentangle the navigation bar and icon colors from the necessary colors to contrast with the canvas. Because we can color the icons differently when dragging as opposed to default or hover/active states, we can use the surface logic to make sure the dragged icon will always contrast with the canvas.\r\n#### Accessibility\r\nAnother helper function built into this theming approach is one that will check the contrast between a foreground color, and the background it will be used on. This helps to ensure a 4.5:1 contrast ratio which should mean that NiFi will have a WCAG 2.1 AA rating for color contrast.\r\n### Light and Dark themes\r\nThis approach also enabled me to re-use the same palettes for both dark and light themes. For the material theme, they were given different values for “default”, “lighter”, and “darker”. For the Canvas themes, the surface and on-surface paradigm meant that the same palettes could be used for both light and dark as well, without having to declare new values for “default”, “lighter”, and “darker”.\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-07T00:50:31Z","updated_at":"2024-03-21T17:03:11Z","closed_at":"2024-03-13T21:29:29Z","merged_at":"2024-03-13T21:29:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"06c011306356992ef6fa9fcb3b31c9ad658d7589","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6268187900,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAanjsM8AAAABdZz0_A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/labels/new%20ui","name":"new

Background\r\nPrevious iterations of support for Kafka client versions in NiFi (1.0, 2.0, 2.6) duplicated code from existing Kafka processors into new Maven modules, adjusted Kafka client library dependencies for the new modules, and adjusted for API differences as needed. The original JIRA associated with NiFi support for Kafka 3 (`NIFI-9330`), followed this same approach. After discussion, a new approach was chosen, and a new JIRA (`NIFI-11259`) created.\r\n\r\n- Refactor Kafka client library dependencies into a new controller service.\r\n- Expose a service API that was agnostic of any particular Kafka version.\r\n- Create new processor implementations that interacted with Kafka through the service API.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the new processor module should have no Kafka dependencies. This is expected to ease the transition to future Kafka versions.\r\n\r\n- A new 3.0++ controller service might be created to isolate any major API changes to the Kafka client APIs.\r\n- The new `PublishKafka` and `ConsumeKafka` processors would need minimal / no changes to enable interactivity with the new controller service.\r\n\r\nOther refactoring activities have been undertaken at the same time:\r\n\r\n- The new `PublishKafka` processor is intended as a replacement for the existing `PublishKafka_2_6` and `PublishKafkaRecord_2_6` processor pair. It provides FlowFile-based or record-based data handling modes, controlled via a per-processor property. Similarly, `ConsumeKafka` replaces both `ConsumeKafka_2_6` and `ConsumeKafkaRecord_2_6`. This design adjustment reduces the code duplication that was present in the 2.6 processor set.\r\n\r\n# New Modules\r\n- `nifi-kafka-service-api` - API contract for `KafkaConnectionService`, which exposes access to instances of `KafkaConsumerService` and `KafkaProducerService` in a manner agnostic to a particular version of Kafka\r\n  - `KafkaProducerService` - intermediary logical service brokering interactions with the producer APIs of the Kafka client libraries\r\n  - `KafkaConsumerService` - intermediary logical service brokering interactions with the producer APIs of the Kafka client libraries\r\n- `nifi-kafka-service-api-nar` - NiFi NAR wrapper for the `KafkaConnectionService` API contract\r\n\r\n- `nifi-kafka-3-service` - home for `Kafka3ConnectionService`, which abstracts Kafka dependencies away from the new Kafka processors, and manages runtime connections to a remote Kafka 3 service instance\r\n- `nifi-kafka-3-service-nar` - NiFi NAR wrapper for `Kafka3ConnectionService`\r\n\r\n- `nifi-kafka-processors` - home for `PublishKafka` and `ConsumeKafka` processors, which allow interactivity with remote Kafka service instances agnostic to a particular Kafka version\r\n- `nifi-kafka-nar` - NiFi NAR wrapper for the `PublishKafka` and `ConsumeKafka` processors\r\n\r\n- `nifi-kafka-2-6-integration` - test bed to establish runtime behavior (testcontainers/kafka) of Kafka 2.6 processors for certain conditions, in order to better replicate those behaviors\r\n- `nifi-kafka-3-integration` - testing infrastructure to test new processors / controller service while communicating with an actual (testcontainers) Kafka instance\r\n- `nifi-kafka-jacoco` - module home for configuration to instrument executions of `nifi-kafka-bundle` unit tests / integration tests, in order to assess test coverage\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n- Integration tests are employed as a \"first-class citizen\" means of testing expected interactions with Kafka instances, running in `testcontainers`.\r\n  - https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java\r\n- It is possible to use a single instance of testcontainers/kafka per Maven module, in order to incur the startup/teardown cost only once. The intent is to employ this strategy where feasible.\r\n- Instances of `simplelogger.properties` have been useful during development, but these would be removed before PR merge.\r\n- I’ve done a significant amount of runtime testing against containerized Kafka instances using the repo/branch below. This resource may be useful for others who want to do runtime testing without the need for fixed Kafka infrastructure.\r\n  - https://github.com/greyp9/kafka-images/tree/NIFI-12194\r\n- There are opportunities to refactor common methods and declarations into the `nifi-kafka-shared` module; I’ve avoided that during development to ease the process of rebasing to `nifi/main`.\r\n- It is likely that this set of new components will co-exist with the existing Kafka 2.6 based processors for some period of time.\r\n  - Allow for migration of existing flows to use the new components.\r\n  - Slight behavioral differences might be anticipated during the \"burn in\" phase of the new components, due to the scope of work.\r\n- Code compatibility with JRE 8 has been targeted, to leave open the option of backporting this work to the support/1.x branch.\r\n- The PR as is should support the following authentication strategies: `PLAINTEXT`, `SSL`, `SASL_PLAINTEXT`, and `SASL_SSL`. Support for additional authentication strategies could be handled via follow on JIRAs.\r\n- Support for the `KafkaRecordSink` form factor could be handled via follow on JIRAs.\r\n- Support for Kafka \"exactly once\" semantics could be handled via follow on JIRAs.\r\n- Migration documentation could be handled via follow on JIRAs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache NiFi

that the thread adding an object to the JavaObjectBindings was not necessarily the thread removing them. The algorithm that was in place assumed that the same thread would be used, in order to ensure that an object could be unbound before being accessed. The new algorithm binds each new object to all active method invocations and only unbinds the objects after all method invocations complete, regardless of thread. Additionally, found that many method calls could create new proxies on the Python side, just for getter methods whose values don't change. This is very expensive, so introduced a new @Idempotent annotation that can be added to interface methods such that we can cache the value and avoid the expensive overhead.\r\n\r\n<!-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more -->\r\n<!-- contributor license agreements.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12821](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12821) Set the `docker-maven-plugin` version to 0.43.4 instead of automatically using the latest available version. Recent `docker-tests` workflow executions have failed with automatically resolving version `0.44.0`, so this change sets the plugin version to the one known to be working with current settings.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include reducing the workflow timeout from 120 to 60 minutes, as most `docker-tests` workflows finish in less than 40 minutes.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12813](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12813) Corrects username handling in the application HTTP request log written to `nifi-request.log` in the default Logback configuration.\r\n\r\nUpgrading to Jetty 12 in NiFi 2.0.0-M2 required changing the filter responsible for setting the authenticated user required for the Jetty `CustomRequestLog`. The initial change referenced the wrong `AuthenticationState` interface, resulting in a failure to retrieve the authenticated user attribute during the logging. This issue does not impact any authentication or authorization behavior and is limited to username logging, which can also be tracked using other loggers in `nifi-user.log`.\r\n\r\nCorrecting the `AuthenticationState` interface reference resolves the problem, and can be validated by authenticating to NiFi and confirming the presence of the username in the `nifi-request.log`. Additional changes include a new unit test to verify the presence of the expected request attribute name and value.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12811](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12811) Upgrades Spring Framework dependencies from 6.0.16 to [6.0.17](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v6.0.17) and Spring Security dependencies from 6.2.0 to [6.2.2](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/releases/tag/6.2.2).\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include upgrading Registry's version of Spring Framework from 6.1.3 to [6.1.4](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v6.1.4).\r\n\r\nTesting Spring Framework 6.1.4 with NiFi continues to exhibit problems with AOP parameter resolution in Auditor classes, which is the reason for the version differences between NiFi and Registry for now.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11443](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11443) Updates Python Process log handling to route messages to SLF4J so that logging levels and appenders can be managed using Logback.\r\n\r\nThese changes remove the need for separate Python log settings in `nifi.properties` and support translating Python log levels and logger names to Logback.\r\n\r\nThe implementation changes the Python logging format to use the Python [level numbers](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#levels) for optimized parsing. The implementation changes Python logging to write messages to the standard output stream, and the `PythonProcess` builder creates a Java Virtual Thread to read lines from the `BufferedReader` containing process output stream messages.\r\n\r\nThese changes eliminate the dedicated `nifi-python.log` and enable Python logging to be handled along with other framework logging that defaults to the `nifi-app.log` file appender.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi
