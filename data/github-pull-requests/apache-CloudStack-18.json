Description\r\n\r\nWhen assigning a VM to another account (`assignVirtualMachine API`), if a network error happens during the process, no rollback is executed; thus, leaving the DB in an inconsistent state.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by processing all steps to change the ownership of a VM inside the transaction.

Description\r\n\r\nACS only allows root admins to enter tags during the creation of service, disk, and network offerings; however, in private cloud environments, domain admin accounts may have autonomy and knowledge of the infrastructure, being able to direct resources according to their needs. \r\n\r\nTo enable this behavior, a new account-level setting (`allow.domain.admins.to.create.offerings.with.tags`) has been created. When disabled (default), the previous behavior is maintained; when enabled, the domain admin account can enter tags when creating disk and service offerings. As we did not see a use case for network offering tags, these were not touched, that is, this new configuration will not affect network offering creation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the UI has been changed to allow domain admins to inform these fields when the configuration is enabled. To enable this UI behavior, a new API was created, `isAccountAllowedToCreateOfferingsWithTags`, which only receives the ID of the account to be validated, and returns true if the account can create offerings with tags and false otherwise.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nWith the  `allow.domain.admins.to.create.offerings.with.tags` set to false (default), and using CloudMonkey logged in as a domain admin, I tried to call the create/update service/disk offering APIs while passing some tags as parameters, all the calls returned exceptions.\r\n\r\nI Then set the configuration to `true`, and recalled the APIs with the same parameters, and all of them successfully ran.\r\n \r\nIn the UI, logged in as a domain admin, and the `allow.domain.admins.to.create.offerings.with.tags` set to false, I opened the create disk/compute offering forms, and the tags fields did not appear.\r\n\r\nI then set the configuration to `true`, and retried opening the create disk/compute offering forms, the tags did appear, and I successfully created the offerings.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen taking a snapshot of a volume in a VM with an ISO attached, ACS attempts to define the label of the target associated with the ISO by its ID. However, this ID may not be correctly mapped to the label, which causes the snapshot to fail.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by using the defined label, instead of defining it during the snapshot process by its ID.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn a local lab, I created 3 VMs with ISOs attached: VM1, VM2 and VM3. VM1 had 1 volume, VM2 had 2 volumes, and VM3 had 3 volumes.  The label of the target associated to the ISO was `hdc` for all of them. \r\n\r\nWhen taking a snapshot for the volume in VM1, the label was incorrectly generated as `hdb`, which caused the snapshot to fail.\r\nWhen taking snapshots for the volumes in VM2, the label was correctly generated as `hdc`, and the snapshots succeeded.\r\nWhen taking snapshots for the volumes in VM3, the label was

ACS stores all dates in the DB with the UTC timezone, all APIs that have parameters of type date are handled according to the server's timezone. In this case, if the server's timezone is in UTC-3, for instance, and user is in UTC-2 and inform `yyyy-MM-dd 09:00:00` in the parameter, the Date object will be `yyyy-MM-dd 09:00:00` (UTC-3) and ACS will convert it to `yyyy-MM-dd 12:00:00` while querying the database. This way, if the final users want to retrieve data from date `09:00:00`, they must know the server's timezone in order to inform the correspondent date (in this example, `yyyy-MM-dd 06:00:00`).\r\n\r\nThis situation is very clear when calling the `listvirtualmachinesusagehistory` API. If the data was collected at `yyyy-MM-dd 12:00:00` (UTC), final user must know that the server is in UTC-3 and inform `yyyy-MM-dd 09:00:00`. Via UI, either using the local timezone or not, the informed timestamp is always converted to UTC. Then, the server would consider this converted timestamp as UTC-3, and would convert it to UTC again, adding 3 hours to the date and returning nothing. Example: user is in UTC-2 and informs `yyyy-MM-dd 10:00:00`; the UI converts it to UTC (`yyyy-MM-dd 12:00:00`); ACS interprets it as UTC-3 and converts again to UTC (`yyyy-MM-dd 15:00:00`).\r\n\r\nTo handle this situation, an extension was made to allow all APIs that have parameters of type date to also receive them in the format with timezone `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ`, for example, `2022-12-20T14:33:42+0100`. This change only extends the date parameter, previous behavior still works normally. Thus the user will be able to send requests with the chosen timezone, and the ACS will carry out the conversion to the timezone it operates.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the VM stats listing in the UI has been updated to always send the date and time with the timezone of the user's machine.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to

This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nAfter setting the management server's timezone to UTC+1, and setting `vm.stats.max.retention.time` to 5, I did the following tests: \r\n| # | Test | Result | \r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| 1 | I called the `listvirtualmachinesusagehistory` API with the `startdate` as 5 minutes prior to the tests time, passing my timezone (UTC-3) | The stats were correctly recovered | \r\n| 2 | I called the API with the same timestamp, but informing UTC-4 as the timezone | No records were returned|\r\n| 3 | I called the API with the `startdate` as 5 minutes prior to the tests time, informing the date and time using the UTC+1 timezone, but without informing the timezone, e.g. `2022-12-28 15:10:00` | The stats were correctly recovered |\r\n| 4 | I called the API with

Description\r\n\r\nIt was noticed that the APIs (most of them) follow a pattern in which the *response name* equals to `APINAME.toLowerCase() + 'response'`, which is the value returned by `getCommandName` method.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am proposing the removal of the different repeated `getCommandName` instructions throughout the APIs. Additionally, it also removed API name/_response name_ declarations from the affected classes; the API name values were moved to the `name` parameter in `@APICommand`.\r\n\r\nTo help me in the process of normalizing the code base, I created a script that iterates through the APIs using the existing method in class `ApiXmlDocWriter`. The number of APIs that did not follow the standard is 88, so they weren't changed, and they can be seen in the collapse below with their respective _response name_ and how they would be if they were in the majority standard:\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Unchanged APIs</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows securing the console access through CloudStack to the virtual machines running on KVM. The secure access is achieved through the generated certificates for the CA Framework in CloudStack, that provides mutual TLS connections between agents. These certificates are used to also secure the connection between the console proxies and the VNC ports for VM console access.\r\n\r\nThis feature is only supported on the KVM hypervisor\r\n\r\nDesign

Description\r\n\r\nWhen scaling a VM, the new details of the compute resources (memory, CPU speed, and CPU cores) are updated in the database after generating the usage event. This way, the usage events are generated with outdated details. Usage uses those events while generating entries in `cloud_usage.usage_vm_instance` and `cloud_usage.cloud_usage`, however, as in the scaling the details are updated after generating the events, the entries for the VM in `cloud_usage.usage_vm_instance` are always outdated after the scaling, as well the entries in `cloud_usage.cloud_usage`. In order to make Usage generate the proper entries, operators must stop and start the VM again (generating events of stop and start with the current VM compute resources' state).\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to fix this behavior by updating the details before generating the usage event, making the events synchronized with the current VM compute resources' state.\r\n\r\n### Types of

testing process, then I created a new VM with a constrained offering, and started scaling it.\r\n\r\nBefore this change, the entries in `cloud_usage.usage_vm_instance` and `cloud_usage.cloud_usage` would contain the memory, CPU speed, and CPU cores of the VM from before the last scaling, e.g., after the first scaling, the entries would have the original details, after the second scaling, the

Description\r\n\r\nCloudStack has used StandardPBEStringEncryptor from jasypt for more than 10 years. \r\n\r\nThe encryptor use algorithm \"PBEWithMD5AndDes\", which is considered as Insecure, because it uses MD5 and DES which has only 56-bits key.\r\n\r\nAfter investigation, we decided to replace it with an implementation of AES-GCM algorithm.\r\n\r\nMain changes of this PR\r\n\r\n- Introduce new encryptor AeadBase64Encryptor, which is based on AesGcmJce\r\n- Improve cloudstack-setup-databases to set up cloudstack database with different encryptors\r\n- Improve cloudstack-migrate-database to migrate cloudstack properties and database with different management key, database key or encryptor version.\r\n- Improve cloudstack startup process so that both legacy and new encryptors work. Existing environments work well without any change.\r\n\r\nMore details on cwiki: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/New+database+encryption+cipher+-+AeadBase64Encryptor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: #

NonDex is a tool that will introduce non-determinism in certain java collections.\r\n\r\nThe cause of failure is because the test is comparing the string format of two hashmaps, however, as per [Oracle's documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html):\r\n\r\n> The HashMap class is roughly equivalent to Hashtable, except that it is unsynchronized and permits nulls. This class makes no guarantees as to the order of the map; in particular, it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time.\r\n\r\nSo the result of `toString()` is non-deterministic. Use hashmap's own equal methods is more reasonable.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n<img width=\"1079\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28588062/206830625-a1dbd09c-fdeb-4b3b-8652-f4cccdcf975d.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the failure:\r\n\r\nRun the following command in cloudstack:\r\n\r\n 1.

Description\r\n\r\nACS does not allow the operator to define the visibility of roles, meaning all of them are visible to all users, with the exception of Root Admin roles.\r\n\r\nIn order to address this situation, a new parameter `public_role` has been created in the following APIs: `createRole`, `updateRole` and `importRole`. This parameter adds a new property to the role, allowing it to be hidden from the users; so, when updating, importing or creating a new role it is possible for the operator to inform if it is public (visible to all users) or private (only visible to Root Admins and the creator of the role). Also, the behavior of the API `listRoles` has been adjusted to return the roles according to this new property.\r\n\r\nThe following are examples of the listings using a Root Admin account and a Domain Admin account.\r\n\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Listing with a Root Admin account</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n(localcloud) 🐱 > list roles\r\n{\r\n  \"count\": 10,\r\n  \"role\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"description\": \"Default root admin role\",\r\n      \"id\": \"64b34ae1-26de-11ec-8dcf-5254005dcdac\",\r\n      \"isdefault\": true,\r\n      \"ispublic\": false,\r\n      \"name\": \"Root Admin\",\r\n      \"type\": \"Admin\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"description\": \"Default resource admin role\",\r\n      \"id\": \"64b38969-26de-11ec-8dcf-5254005dcdac\",\r\n      \"isdefault\": true,\r\n      \"ispublic\": true,\r\n      \"name\": \"Resource Admin\",\r\n      \"type\": \"ResourceAdmin\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"description\": \"Default domain admin role\",\r\n      \"id\": \"64b48e57-26de-11ec-8dcf-5254005dcdac\",\r\n      \"isdefault\": true,\r\n      \"ispublic\": true,\r\n      \"name\": \"Domain Admin\",\r\n      \"type\": \"DomainAdmin\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"description\": \"Default user role\",\r\n      \"id\": \"64b4ca77-26de-11ec-8dcf-5254005dcdac\",\r\n      \"isdefault\": true,\r\n      \"ispublic\": true,\r\n      \"name\": \"User\",\r\n      \"type\": \"User\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"description\": \"Default read-only admin role\",\r\n      \"id\": \"68ea06f5-26de-11ec-8dcf-5254005dcdac\",\r\n      \"isdefault\": true,\r\n      \"ispublic\": false,\r\n      \"name\": \"Read-Only Admin -

I created two new roles using the `createRole` API. One with the parameter `public_role` set to `false` and one with it set to `true`. I verified that both roles were successfully created with the specified parameters.\r\n\r\n2. I repeated the same steps from the first test, but this time using the `importRole` API instead. I verified that the roles were successfully imported with the specified parameters.\r\n\r\n3. I updated the `public_role` parameter from two different roles using the `updateRole` API, the first one had the parameter as `true` and I updated it to `false` and the second had it as `false` and I updated it to `true`. Both were successfully updated.\r\n\r\n4. I used the API `listRoles` using a Root Admin account and verified that every role was visible.\r\n\r\n5. I used the API `listRoles` using a Domain Admin account and verified that it could not see private roles.\r\n\r\n6. I created an account of the type user using a private role and verified that it could log in.\r\n\r\n7. With this same account I created a new network, and a new VM, and verified that both worked normally.\r\n\r\n8. I repeated tests 6 and 7 but this time with an account of the type Root Admin, and verified that it worked aswell.","created_at":"2022-12-08T11:58:40Z","updated_at":"2023-06-01T11:40:47Z","closed_at":"2023-05-01T13:26:10Z","merged_at":"2023-05-01T13:26:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"8b5bfb145e335209e261056a691ffeb7372ca0e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":904051781,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MDQwNTE3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"a9b50e","default":false,"description":"Warning...

Description\r\n\r\nDuring the creation of a VPC offering, any type of service offering can be informed. However, selecting an improper service offering type can lead to a VR boot failure. Furthermore, during VPC or network offering creation, it is possible to provide an inactive service offering. \r\n\r\nThis PR allows the creation of VPC offerings only with VR service offerings, and blocks the creation of new VPC and network offerings with inactive service offerings. Any offering already created will maintain current behavior. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI applied the changes in a local lab and attempted to create network offerings and VPC offerings with inactive service offerings. Additionally, I attempted to create VPC offerings with offerings in which the System VM type is not `domainrouter`. All attempts failed.\r\n\r\nAttempts where the System VM type is `domainrouter` and the offering is active were successful.","created_at":"2022-12-07T20:24:19Z","updated_at":"2023-04-06T13:47:35Z","closed_at":"2023-01-31T07:42:57Z","merged_at":"2023-01-31T07:42:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"26eaae78723727556aec7afbdd06e97006735443","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073351,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMzNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:vpc","name":"component:vpc","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":592559219,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTI1NTkyMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:networking","name":"component:networking","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/23/labels","id":7233557,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AbmAV","number":23,"title":"4.18.0.0","description":"released","creator":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":323,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-08T08:55:48Z","updated_at":"2024-06-10T07:59:31Z","due_on":"2023-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2023-03-15T18:50:04Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6957/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6957/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/6957/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/c20b5ac0fdfdd304823b2c777b92c38f8be4db53","head":{"label":"scclouds:check-vpc-offering-type-and-status-during-creation","ref":"check-vpc-offering-type-and-status-during-creation","sha":"c20b5ac0fdfdd304823b2c777b92c38f8be4db53","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclou

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows users to define the password of a virtual machine when deploying the VM (`deployVirtualMachine` API). If no password is informed, current ACS behavior is maintained: a random password is generated, injected into the VM, and returned to the user.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI applied the changes in a local lab, called the `deployVirtualMachine` API defining a password, and successfully accessed the VM with the password I have defined. Additionally, I called the `deployVirtualMachine` API without defining a password, and successfully accessed the VM with the random password generated.

Description\r\n\r\nACS has an API to change the account that owns a VM; however, it is not possible to perform the same type of operation  for volumes. Therefore, we created the API `assignVolume` to allow the transition of volumes between accounts. For this, the user executing the operation needs the following:\r\n- permission to the `assignVolume` API\r\n- must be able to access the account that will receive the volume\r\n- must be able to access the volume being moved to a new account\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n| N | Test | Result | Expected behavior? |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n|1| Call the API to change a volume's owner between two different accounts | the volume's owner was changed | yes |\r\n|2| Call the API to change the volume's owner to its own account  | Exception | yes |\r\n|3| Call the API to change the volume's owner to a disabled account  | Exception | yes |\r\n|4| Call the API to change the volume's owner to a locked account  | Exception | yes |\r\n|5| Call the API to change the volume's owner while the volume is attached | Exception | yes |\r\n|6| Call the API to change the volume's owner while the volume has a snapshot | Exception | yes |\r\n|7| Call the API to change a volume's owner between two different accounts, while the volume is on the secondary storage | The volume was moved from the original accounts secondary storage directory to the new owner's secondary storage directory and then was reassigned | yes
