This prevents an errant <!-- raw HTML omitted --> closing preceding\nstructure. Also added appropriate error message outputs in this case.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1851\">jhy/jsoup#1851</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: Corrected support for ruby elements (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->) to current spec.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1294\">jhy/jsoup#1294</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: When using Node.before(node) or Node.after(node), if the incoming node was a sibling of the context node,\nthe incoming node may be inserted into the wrong relative location.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1898\">jhy/jsoup#1898</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: In Jsoup.connect(url), if the input URL had components that were already % escaped, they would be escaped\nagain, causing errors when fetched.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1902\">jhy/jsoup#1902</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when tracking input source positions, text in tables that was fostered had invalid positions.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1927\">jhy/jsoup#1927</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: If the Document.OutputSettings class was initialized, and then Entities.escape(String) called, an NPE may be\nthrown due to a class loading circular dependency.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1910\">jhy/jsoup#1910</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when pretty-printing, the first inline Element or Comment in a block would not be wrap-indented if it were\npreceded by a blank text node.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1906\">jhy/jsoup#1906</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when pretty-printing a <!-- raw HTML omitted --> containing block tags, those tags were incorrectly indented.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1891\">jhy/jsoup#1891</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when pretty-printing nested inlineable blocks (such as a <!-- raw HTML omitted --> in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->), the inner element should be\nindented.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1926\">jhy/jsoup#1926</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tags should be wrap-indented when in block tags (and not when in inline tags).\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1911\">jhy/jsoup#1911</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: the contents of a sufficiently large <!-- raw HTML omitted --> with un-escaped HTML closing tags may be incorrectly parsed\nto an empty node.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1929\">jhy/jsoup#1929</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

For example, to match by classname <!-- raw HTML omitted -->, use document.select(&quot;p.one\\.two&quot;);\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/838\">jhy/jsoup#838</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, wrap text that follows a <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1858\">jhy/jsoup#1858</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, normalize newlines that follow self-closing tags in custom tags.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1852\">jhy/jsoup#1852</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, collapse non-significant whitespace between a block and an inline tag.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1802\">jhy/jsoup#1802</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Element#forEach and Node#forEachNode, use java.util.function.Consumer instead of the previous\nAndroid compatibility shim org.jsoup.helper.Consumer. Subsequently, the latter has been deprecated.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1870\">jhy/jsoup#1870</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a new method Document#forms(), to conveniently retrieve a List<!-- raw HTML omitted --> containing the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nelements in a document.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a new method Document#expectForm(query), to find the first matching FormElement, or blow up\ntrying.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: URLs containing characters such as [ and ] were not escaped correctly, and would throw a\nMalformedURLException when fetched.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1873\">jhy/jsoup#1873</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: Element.cssSelector would create invalid selectors for elements where the tag name, ID, or classnames needed\nto be escaped (e.g. if a class name contained a ':' or '.').\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1742\">jhy/jsoup#1742</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: element.text() should have a space between a block and an inline element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1877\">jhy/jsoup#1877</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: if a Node or an Element was replaced with itself, that node would incorrectly be orphaned.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1843\">jhy/jsoup#1843</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: form data on a previous request was copied to a new request in newRequest(), resulting in an accumulation of\nform data when executing multi-step form submissions, or data sent to later requests incorrectly. Now, newRequest()\nonly copies session related settings (cookies, proxy settings, user-agent, etc) but not the request data nor the\nbody.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1778\">jhy/jsoup#1778</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: fixed an issue in Safelist.removeAttributes which could throw a ConcurrentModificationException when using\nthe &quot;:all&quot; pseudo-attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: given extremely deeply nested HTML, a number of methods in Element could throw a StackOverflowError due</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

now, we have seen an increase in problems/incompatibilities with recent versions of the JDK due to our usage of JVM-internal API.\nMost notably, JDK 17 made some changes which are incompatible with the current subclass mockmaker.\nTherefore, to prepare for the future of JDK, we are making some core changes to ensure Mockito keeps on working.</p>\n<h2>Switch the default mockmaker to <code>mockito-inline</code></h2>\n<p>Back in Mockito 2.7.6, we published a new mockmaker based on the &quot;inline bytecode&quot; principle.\nThis mockmaker creates mocks manipulating bytecode equivalent within the original class such that its method implementations hook into the normal Mockito machinery.\nAs a comparison, the subclass mockmaker generates &quot;real&quot; subclasses for mocks, to mimic the same behavior.\nWhile the approaches are similar, the inline mockmaker avoids certain restrictions that the JDK imposes.\nFor example, it does not violate module boundaries (introduced in JDK 9, but more heavily used in JDK 17) and avoids the leaking of the creation of the subclass.</p>\n<p>Massive thanks to community member <a

now, we have seen an increase in problems/incompatibilities with recent versions of the JDK due to our usage of JVM-internal API.\nMost notably, JDK 17 made some changes which are incompatible with the current subclass mockmaker.\nTherefore, to prepare for the future of JDK, we are making some core changes to ensure Mockito keeps on working.</p>\n<h2>Switch the default mockmaker to <code>mockito-inline</code></h2>\n<p>Back in Mockito 2.7.6, we published a new mockmaker based on the &quot;inline bytecode&quot; principle.\nThis mockmaker creates mocks manipulating bytecode equivalent within the original class such that its method implementations hook into the normal Mockito machinery.\nAs a comparison, the subclass mockmaker generates &quot;real&quot; subclasses for mocks, to mimic the same behavior.\nWhile the approaches are similar, the inline mockmaker avoids certain restrictions that the JDK imposes.\nFor example, it does not violate module boundaries (introduced in JDK 9, but more heavily used in JDK 17) and avoids the leaking of the creation of the subclass.</p>\n<p>Massive thanks to community member <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who implemented this change.</p>\n<p>Note: this does not affect <code>mockito-android</code> nor testing on Android.</p>\n<h3>When should I still be using the subclass mockmaker?</h3>\n<p>There are legitimate remaining use cases for the subclass mockmaker.\nFor example, on the Graal VM's native image, the inline mockmaker will not work and the subclass mockmaker is the appropriate choice.\nAdditionally, if you would like to avoid mocking final classes, using the subclass mockmaker is a possibibility.\nNote however that if you solely want to use the subclass mockmaker to avoid mocking final, you will run into the above mentioned issues on JDK 17+.\nWe want to leave this choice up to our users, which is why we will keep on supporting the subclass mockmaker.</p>\n<p>If you want to use the subclass mockmaker instead, you can use the new <code>mockito-subclass</code> artifact (published <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-subclass\">on Maven Central</a> along with all our other artifacts).</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[mockito-core](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) from 4.5.1 to 5.0.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/releases\">mockito-core's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.0.0</h2>\n<h1>Mockito 5: prepare for future JDK versions</h1>\n<p>For a while now, we have seen an increase in problems/incompatibilities with recent versions of the JDK due to our usage of JVM-internal API.\nMost notably, JDK 17 made some changes which are incompatible with the current subclass mockmaker.\nTherefore, to prepare for the future of JDK, we are making some core changes to ensure Mockito keeps on working.</p>\n<h2>Switch the default mockmaker to <code>mockito-inline</code></h2>\n<p>Back in Mockito 2.7.6, we published a new mockmaker based on the &quot;inline bytecode&quot; principle.\nThis mockmaker creates mocks manipulating bytecode equivalent within the original class such that its method implementations hook into the normal Mockito machinery.\nAs a comparison, the subclass mockmaker generates &quot;real&quot; subclasses for mocks, to mimic the same behavior.\nWhile the approaches are similar, the inline mockmaker avoids certain restrictions that the JDK imposes.\nFor example, it does not violate module boundaries (introduced in JDK 9, but more heavily used in JDK 17) and avoids the leaking of the creation of the subclass.</p>\n<p>Massive thanks to community member <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who implemented this change.</p>\n<h3>When should I still be using the subclass mockmaker?</h3>\n<p>There are legitimate remaining use cases for the subclass mockmaker.\nFor example, on the Graal VM's native image, the inline mockmaker will not work and the subclass mockmaker is the appropriate choice.\nAdditionally, if you would like to avoid mocking final classes, using the subclass mockmaker is a possibibility.\nNote however that if you solely want to use the subclass mockmaker to avoid mocking final, you will run into the above mentioned issues on JDK 17+.\nWe want to leave this choice up to our users, which is why we will keep on supporting the subclass mockmaker.</p>\n<p>If you want to use the subclass mockmaker instead, you can use the new <code>mockito-subclass</code> artifact (published <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-subclass\">on Maven Central</a> along with all our other artifacts).</p>\n<h2>Update the minimum supported Java version to 11</h2>\n<p>Mockito 4 supports Java 8 and above.\nSimilar to other open source projects, we are moving away from JDK 8 and to newer versions.\nThe primary reason for moving away from JDK 8 is the increasing maintenance costs with keeping our own infrastructure working.\nLately we have been running into more and more JDK 8 breakages.\nAdditionally, while we want to support the newest JDK API's, our current solution to support both JDK 8 and newer versions causes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2798\">issues with the <code>SecurityManager</code></a>.\nSince we want Mockito to work on the newest version and more and more businesses adopting JDK 11, we have decided to make the switch as well.</p>\n<p>Massive thanks to community member <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who implemented this change.</p>\n<h3>What should I do if I still run JDK 8?</h3>\n<p>For JDK 8 and below, you can keep on using Mockito 4.\nThis is similar to if you are using JDK 6, for which you can keep on using Mockito 2.\nThe changes in Mockito 5 (for now) are primarily focused on the latest JDK versions, which means the API differences between Mockito 4 and 5 are minimal.\nHowever, over time this will most likely widen, so we do recommend adopting JDK 11 in the future.</p>\n<h2>New <code>type()</code> method on <code>ArgumentMatcher</code></h2>\n<p>One of our most used public API's for customizing Mockito is the <a href=\"https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/ArgumentMatcher.html\"><code>ArgumentMatcher</code> interface</a>.\nThe interface allows you to define a custom matcher, which you can pass into method arguments to provide more targeted matches.\nOne major shortcoming of the <code>ArgumentMatcher</code> was the lack of varargs support.</p>\n<!-- raw

href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/CHANGES\">jsoup's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>Release 1.15.3 [2022-Aug-24]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Security: fixed an issue where the jsoup cleaner may incorrectly sanitize crafted XSS attempts if\nSafeList.preserveRelativeLinks is enabled.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369\">https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the Cleaner will preserve the source position of cleaned elements, if source tracking is enabled in the\noriginal parse.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the error messages output from Validate are more descriptive. Exceptions are now ValidationExceptions\n(extending IllegalArgumentException). Stack traces do not include the Validate class, to make it simpler to see\nwhere the exception originated. Common validation errors including malformed URLs and empty selector results have\nmore explicit error messages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: the DataUtil would incorrectly read from InputStreams that emitted reads less than the requested size. This\nlead to incorrect results when parsing from chunked server responses, for e.g.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1807\">jhy/jsoup#1807</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build Improvement: added implementation version and related fields to the jar manifest.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1809\">jhy/jsoup#1809</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*** Release 1.15.2 [2022-Jul-04]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the ability to track the position (line, column, index) in the original input source from where\na given node was parsed. Accessible via Node.sourceRange() and Element.endSourceRange().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1790\">jhy/jsoup#1790</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element.firstElementChild(), Element.lastElementChild(), Node.firstChild(), Node.lastChild(),\nas convenient accessors to those child nodes and elements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element.expectFirst(cssQuery), which is just like Element.selectFirst(), but instead of returning\na null if there is no match, will throw an IllegalArgumentException. This is useful if you want to simply abort\nprocessing if an expected match is not found.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing HTML, doctypes are emitted on a newline if there is a preceding comment.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1664\">jhy/jsoup#1664</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, trim the leading and trailing spaces of textnodes in block tags when possible,\nso that they are indented correctly.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1798\">jhy/jsoup#1798</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Element#selectXpath(), disable namespace awareness. This makes it possible to always select elements\nby their simple local name, regardless of whether an xmlns attribute was set.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1801\">jhy/jsoup#1801</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when using the readToByteBuffer method, such as in Connection.Response.body(), if the document has not\nalready been parsed and must be read fully, and there is any maximum buffer size being applied, only the default\ninternal buffer size is read.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1774\">jhy/jsoup#1774</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

introducing verify mojo to allow split of analysis and verification into lifecycle phases of one's choosing.  One use case for that is running multiple code analyzers at once and only failing the build at a later stage, so that all of them have a chance to run.  Verify then in this case just uses an existing file.</li>\n<li>Updated readme with various informatino about groovy, security manager, and m2e specific to this application considerations that are often asked about.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/f08f5990d4173d7b0e64939b0f3d7c9da5da39ca\"><code>f08f599</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release spotbugs-maven-plugin-4.7.0.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/a45eac35b7f2cdb017aec29f107f3637fd023352\"><code>a45eac3</code></a> [pom] Skip pdf plugin as it doesn't work well</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/8e86861cfc3b7f018163e5a542d2e0a3ea6b63ff\"><code>8e86861</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/issues/434\">#434</a> from hazendaz/spotbugs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/bc6bad23c1c078a229510e9e87474e65709725fa\"><code>bc6bad2</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/issues/433\">#433</a> from spotbugs/dependabot/maven/org.codehaus.plexus-pl...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/02a5e756ce695aec8849a9ecc2c5894a47f8a2eb\"><code>02a5e75</code></a> [pom] Bump jxr plugin to 3.2.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/0036acfefcc3729b83874631db84949a2025de7d\"><code>0036acf</code></a> [pom] Bump findsecbugs IT to 1.12.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/623220ea4a62b58e965c7b6159929e1bd9b74233\"><code>623220e</code></a> [pom] Bump IT compiler to 3.10.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/c21d15a63ab5ada3798c17cff808a6453320d36b\"><code>c21d15a</code></a> [actions] Use jdk 11 with site for now</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/c5bff4703bc7146948b52bb2c209dd8442293530\"><code>c5bff47</code></a> [pom] Update comment in pom</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/e9bf09ce01072c610b43325f068527bc0f717cad\"><code>e9bf09c</code></a> Bump plexus-utils from 3.4.1 to 3.4.2</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/compare/spotbugs-maven-plugin-4.6.0.0...spotbugs-maven-plugin-4.7.0.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=com.github.spotbugs:spotbugs-maven-plugin&package-manager=maven&previous-version=4.6.0.0&new-version=4.7.0.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.15.2 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bugfix: when using the readToByteBuffer method, such as in Connection.Response.body(), if the document has not\nalready been parsed and must be read fully, and there is any maximum buffer size being applied, only the default\ninternal buffer size is read.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1774\">jhy/jsoup#1774</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>*** Release 1.15.1 [2022-May-15]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Change: removed previously deprecated methods and classes (including org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist; use\norg.jsoup.safety.Safelist instead).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when converting jsoup Documents to W3C Documents in W3CDom, preserve HTML valid attribute names if the\ninput document is using the HTML syntax. (Previously, would always coerce using the more restrictive XML syntax.)\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1648\">jhy/jsoup#1648</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the :containsWholeText(text) selector, to match against non-normalized Element text. That can be\nuseful when elements can only be distinguished by e.g. specific case, or leading whitespace, etc.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636\">jhy/jsoup#1636</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#wholeOwnText() to retrieve the original (non-normalized) ownText of an Element. Also\nadded the :containsWholeOwnText(text) selector, to match against that. BR elements are now treated as newlines\nin the wholeText methods.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636\">jhy/jsoup#1636</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the :matchesWholeText(regex) and :matchesWholeOwnText(regex) selectors, to match against whole\n(non-normalized, case sensitive) element text and own text, respectively.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636\">jhy/jsoup#1636</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when evaluating an XPath query against a context element, the complete document is now visible to the\nquery, vs only the context element's sub-tree. This enables support for queries outside (parent or sibling) the\nelement, e.g. ancestor-or-self::*.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1652\">jhy/jsoup#1652</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: allow a maxPaddingWidth on the indent level in OutputSettings when pretty printing. This defaults to\n30 to limit the indent level for very deeply nested elements, and may be disabled by setting to -1.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1655\">jhy/jsoup#1655</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when cloning a Node or an Element, the clone gets a cloned OwnerDocument containing only that clone, so\nas to preserve applicable settings, such as the Pretty Print settings.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/763\">jhy/jsoup#763</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a convenience method Jsoup.parse(File).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1693\">jhy/jsoup#1693</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in the NodeTraversor, added default implementations for NodeVisitor.tail() and NodeFilter.tail(), so\nthat code using only head() methods can be written as lambdas.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in NodeTraversor, added support for removing nodes via Node.remove() during NodeVisitor.head().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1699\">jhy/jsoup#1699</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

2021-09 - now requires jdk 11</li>\n<li>Fix processing on end of line (EOL) markers making it accurate (mixed match resulted in odd behavior)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>ver 2.18.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Support Eclipse 2021-12 (4.22, JDT 3.28) - now requires jdk 11</li>\n<li>Move whitespace trim to ensure it's counted in formatting stats</li>\n<li>Set whitespace trim to default 'true' as it is formatting</li>\n<li>Added support for jsoup maxPaddingWidth, we default to -1 to disable to retain original behaviour on full pretty print</li>\n<li>Add <!-- raw HTML omitted --> block to html tests to demonstrate upstream jsoup bug adding new lines has been fixed</li>\n<li>Add support for trimming trailing spaces from jsoup pretty print so our internal tests can function properly due to jsoup upstream bug</li>\n<li>Add support for counting leading spaces from jsoup pretty print so our internal tests can function property due to jsoup upstream bug</li>\n<li>Add support for breaking '--&gt;&lt;! from jsoup pretty print so our internal tests can function propertly due to jsoup upstream bug</li>\n<li>Run overall code cleanup including using java 10 'var' since we require jdk 11 to work.</li>\n<li>Internal usage of http: has been switched to https and any redirects from old google code were updated to reflect this repo as seen in tests.  One left over http is a bogus site.</li>\n<li>Enhance cache support to not write timestamp to it and to sort content making it safe to check in and use via automation to update when using cross platform such as linux and windows.\nWithout this, it can get random data write as this is read into memory first then written at end with no guarantee of order.</li>\n<li>Added first integration test to confirm caching with sorting and removal of timestamp can be confirmed properly</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/revelc/formatter-maven-plugin/commit/d9e1d74915c055150084ac71422121527d699d69\"><code>d9e1d74</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release formatter-maven-plugin-2.18.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/revelc/formatter-maven-plugin/commit/078173e2dcf24124a4a2d7c273ab71ecd508e121\"><code>078173e</code></a> Clean up JsonFormatter and JsonFormatterTest</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/revelc/formatter-maven-plugin/commit/445ffab532ea0a1bb101681d3505c21842ce6567\"><code>445ffab</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/revelc/formatter-maven-plugin/issues/598\">#598</a> from hazendaz/main</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/revelc/formatter-maven-plugin/commit/7dda0a2f7c2ea9d018c92128d07cfb5fbc5c7ee8\"><code>7dda0a2</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/revelc/formatter-maven-plugin/issues/595\">#595</a> from xenoamess-fork/support_multiple-object_json_file</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/revelc/formatter-maven-plugin/commit/f186f116e114efe901aabb468b41cbad725f3737\"><code>f186f11</code></a> [pom] Let formatter move pom entry for jsoup due to group id change</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/revelc/formatter-maven-plugin/commit/355ee29542af081ce38e2ceeebf41231cf648c41\"><code>355ee29</code></a> [pom] Switch jsoup to fork until jsoup releases later</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/revelc/formatter-maven-plugin/commit/a98bbd2dddbc77dd3714d23df4d92102f6179af9\"><code>a98bbd2</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/revelc/formatter-maven-plugin/issues/597\">#597</a> from hazendaz/master</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/revelc/formatter-maven-plugin/commit/29671d094637748ecadd131da4a1d39e9c8f73ed\"><code>29671d0</code></a> [pom] Bump site plugin to 3.11.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/revelc/formatter-maven-plugin/commit/1a6cc9d548433ffea953331819b0bb9394448b9e\"><code>1a6cc9d</code></a> [pom] Bump project info reports to 3.2.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/revelc/formatter-maven-plugin/commit/da1204f448a070f5dde1718934bd418ae366fbc3\"><code>da1204f</code></a> [pom] Bump javadoc plugin to 3.3.2</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/revelc/formatter-maven-plugin/compare/formatter-maven-plugin-2.17.1...formatter-maven-plugin-2.18.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=net.revelc.code.formatter:formatter-maven-plugin&package-manager=maven&previous-version=2.17.1&new-version=2.18.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/releases\">spotbugs-maven-plugin's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Spotbugs-maven-plugin 4.5.0.0</h2>\n<p>support for spotbugs 4.5.0</p>\n<h2>Spotbugs-maven-plugin 4.4.2.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Use new base-parent pom with removal of undocumented maven url attributes that cause issues for users of older jfrog artifactory installations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spotbugs-maven-plugin 4.4.2.1 Release</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reworked version string to account for any patches we need to make to plugin that would otherwise case a diverge from spotbugs or require us to wait.  This is similar to how other plugins approach this such as lombok.  The first 3 positions are reserved for the alignment with spotbugs.  The last position is for our patch revision level.  Normally this would be '0' but given we released 4.4.2 already, it made sense to denote '1' so that it was clear there was a difference.</li>\n<li>This patch release addresses issues with resolution of the maven dependencies that resulted in a few regression libraries that had vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li>This patch further changed lowest maven from 3.2.5 to 3.3.9 but reality is that even 3.3.9 likely doesn't work.  Since all maven before 3.8.1 are vulnerable, most should be there.  If not, let us know.  Future releases will raise that revision number up.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spotbugs-maven-plugin 4.4.2 Release</h2>\n<p>Added support for spotbugs 4.4.2\nNow running github actions on jdk 17 and 18-ea to show this works there\nNow running against maven 3.8.3\nUpdated a number of plugins and dependencies</p>\n<h2>Spotbugs-maven-plugin 4.4.1 Release</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add support for Sarif</li>\n<li>Support spotbugs 4.4.1</li>\n<li>Library Updates</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/e6f455711fa5d823ca67bbdabd51cd2cd9fe7858\"><code>e6f4557</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release spotbugs-maven-plugin-4.5.0.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/66857ad3847c11999c9b802b475b7f8ac15d9e0b\"><code>66857ad</code></a> [pom] Drop slf4j to 1.7.32</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/fa72729a632810eb24998decb707487af7623b30\"><code>fa72729</code></a> [pom] Bump remainder of spotbugs to 4.5.0 and plugin to 4.5.0.0 snapshot</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/1f30c3919eb7d13d4a73eff3505c74a52e502246\"><code>1f30c39</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/issues/368\">#368</a> from spotbugs/dependabot/maven/com.github.spotbugs-sp...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/967ce4e4f53570ccff2e75214627826c932f685a\"><code>967ce4e</code></a> Bump spotbugs from 4.4.2 to 4.5.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/ac416fe31ec0f0f7118f8f9022e120c55b6b2279\"><code>ac416fe</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/a00e29d56997b9f4247748355a549e837c304629\"><code>a00e29d</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release spotbugs-maven-plugin-4.4.2.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/8c16d9704f00193c736d385b599496b64bb86880\"><code>8c16d97</code></a> [pom] Update base parent without maven url attributes that break older artifa...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/7e4d513d8b6605dbdcd6edf7da8c05a34017654d\"><code>7e4d513</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/issues/366\">#366</a> from spotbugs/dependabot/maven/org.apache.ant-ant-1.1...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/cdcecc47ac78d4efa1f0beedc139e11b45ca4168\"><code>cdcecc4</code></a> Bump ant from 1.10.11 to 1.10.12</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/compare/spotbugs-maven-plugin-4.3.0...spotbugs-maven-plugin-4.5.0.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=com.github.spotbugs:spotbugs-maven-plugin&package-manager=maven&previous-version=4.3.0&new-version=4.5.0.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/releases\">spotbugs-maven-plugin's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Spotbugs-maven-plugin 4.4.2.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Use new base-parent pom with removal of undocumented maven url attributes that cause issues for users of older jfrog artifactory installations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spotbugs-maven-plugin 4.4.2.1 Release</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reworked version string to account for any patches we need to make to plugin that would otherwise case a diverge from spotbugs or require us to wait.  This is similar to how other plugins approach this such as lombok.  The first 3 positions are reserved for the alignment with spotbugs.  The last position is for our patch revision level.  Normally this would be '0' but given we released 4.4.2 already, it made sense to denote '1' so that it was clear there was a difference.</li>\n<li>This patch release addresses issues with resolution of the maven dependencies that resulted in a few regression libraries that had vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li>This patch further changed lowest maven from 3.2.5 to 3.3.9 but reality is that even 3.3.9 likely doesn't work.  Since all maven before 3.8.1 are vulnerable, most should be there.  If not, let us know.  Future releases will raise that revision number up.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spotbugs-maven-plugin 4.4.2 Release</h2>\n<p>Added support for spotbugs 4.4.2\nNow running github actions on jdk 17 and 18-ea to show this works there\nNow running against maven 3.8.3\nUpdated a number of plugins and dependencies</p>\n<h2>Spotbugs-maven-plugin 4.4.1 Release</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add support for Sarif</li>\n<li>Support spotbugs 4.4.1</li>\n<li>Library Updates</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/a00e29d56997b9f4247748355a549e837c304629\"><code>a00e29d</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release spotbugs-maven-plugin-4.4.2.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/8c16d9704f00193c736d385b599496b64bb86880\"><code>8c16d97</code></a> [pom] Update base parent without maven url attributes that break older artifa...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/7e4d513d8b6605dbdcd6edf7da8c05a34017654d\"><code>7e4d513</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/issues/366\">#366</a> from spotbugs/dependabot/maven/org.apache.ant-ant-1.1...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/cdcecc47ac78d4efa1f0beedc139e11b45ca4168\"><code>cdcecc4</code></a> Bump ant from 1.10.11 to 1.10.12</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/2b57e82ca7c5eadcde1f4479436ef53a1317f685\"><code>2b57e82</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/20bbdd5e9630f423d9943a8ef46879c4b9a0efac\"><code>20bbdd5</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release spotbugs-maven-plugin-4.4.2.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/ea259b0fe3334a6ddc297218c710ef258728e462\"><code>ea259b0</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/issues/365\">#365</a> from hazendaz/spotbugs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/9e2368119da25f2edcbd820bb25f18c716ddd5b5\"><code>9e23681</code></a> [pom] Formatting</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/bc67d6b48ef142b108395728ccda0e1b9588f057\"><code>bc67d6b</code></a> [pom] Override maven shared utils to 3.3.4</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/06a2e8b83a5649c3c3d087d66f541895e0fd5414\"><code>06a2e8b</code></a> [pom] Override commons lang2 to 2.6</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/compare/spotbugs-maven-plugin-4.3.0...spotbugs-maven-plugin-4.4.2.2\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=com.github.spotbugs:spotbugs-maven-plugin&package-manager=maven&previous-version=4.3.0&new-version=4.4.2.2)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
