third blob of BatchNorm in Caffe was mistakenly interpreted as the moving average's exponential smoothing factor, while it's actually a scaling factor.\r\nAt test time, accumulated mean and average are divided by this factor before running the forward, as discussed [here](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/4885) ([code](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/src/caffe/layers/batch_norm_layer.cpp#L100-L105)). This PR rescales mean and variance during conversion to reproduce the intended forward behaviour.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the variance regularization epsilon is extracted. Turns out that CuDNN requires that to be bigger than `CUDNN_BN_MIN_EPSILON`, currently set to `1e-5`. Is there a way to get it at conversion runtime?\r\n\r\n@sbodenstein

of.","created_at":"2017-05-07T15:58:08Z","updated_at":"2017-05-08T13:27:05Z","closed_at":"2017-05-08T13:09:23Z","merged_at":"2017-05-08T13:09:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"a3b7a554bf6237859aaad9eff58c03b8c93eb10e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/6144/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/6144/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6144/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/607fd945eae3fa27632b17f3ce3fb070dfbff1e5","head":{"label":"seanpmorgan:numpy-float-indexing","ref":"numpy-float-indexing","sha":"607fd945eae3fa27632b17f3ce3fb070dfbff1e5","user":{"login":"seanpmorgan","id":18154355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTU0MzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18154355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan","html_url":"https://github.com/seanpmorgan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":90402454,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MDQwMjQ1NA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"seanpmorgan/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"seanpmorgan","id":18154355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTU0MzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18154355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan","html_url":"https://github.com/seanpmorgan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpmorgan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/seanpmorgan/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

a reflection padding method, adapted from Torch. Currently has two limitations compared to edge and constant padding\r\n1) Only supports 4D input (edge and constant support 5D too)\r\n2) Cannot pad by an amount bigger than the input size. Behaviour when padding exceeds input size is well defined in numpy (bounce back and forth between input edged until padding area is filled) and can be added\r\n\r\nAlso improved sanity checks and moved them from forward/backward to InferShape.","created_at":"2017-05-05T12:30:59Z","updated_at":"2017-05-09T09:28:42Z","closed_at":"2017-05-09T02:36:20Z","merged_at":"2017-05-09T02:36:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"db300cad64a210206aaf68b6c7042f8a8cdac856","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/6123/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/6123/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6123/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/32e294b5e79d1f6f4badde283f0e2e0a9098f19c","head":{"label":"matteosal:ReflectionPadding","ref":"ReflectionPadding","sha":"32e294b5e79d1f6f4badde283f0e2e0a9098f19c","user":{"login":"matteosal","id":23213959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjEzOTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23213959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosal","html_url":"https://github.com/matteosal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"28efd59e1b5c5595ad23c8cb329ce5e0fa2e9ad5","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

bug make mxnet frequently get segfault on my machine, after some debugging and code tracing I realized it happens in the following condition:\r\n1. Executor calls [`DeleteOperator`](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/a3045e2e9ea59da39236f65b4c687bbcdf7fa2cd/src/engine/threaded_engine.cc#L241-L256)\r\n2. `DeleteOperator` pushes `ThreadedOpr::Delete(threaded_opr);` into the threaded engine.\r\n3. But the write dependency of `ThreadedOpr::Delete(threaded_opr);` is not satisfied because operation `A` is using a dependent variable of `ThreadedOpr::Delete(threaded_opr);`, so `ThreadedOpr::Delete(threaded_opr)` waits `A`.\r\n4. Operation `A` finishes and calls [`ThreadedEngine::OnComplete(A)`](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/a3045e2e9ea59da39236f65b4c687bbcdf7fa2cd/src/engine/threaded_engine.cc#L351-L394).\r\n5. We mark write dependencies of `A` as complete [(these code)](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/a3045e2e9ea59da39236f65b4c687bbcdf7fa2cd/src/engine/threaded_engine.cc#L358-L378).\r\n6. After step 5 [(this line)](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/a3045e2e9ea59da39236f65b4c687bbcdf7fa2cd/src/engine/threaded_engine.cc#L378), the function pushed in step 2 may immediately execute, thus the object which `threaded_opr` points to is destroyed and the memory address may be occupied by other objects.\r\n6. We read `threaded_opr->temporary` in [this line](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/a3045e2e9ea59da39236f65b4c687bbcdf7fa2cd/src/engine/threaded_engine.cc#L391), and get a non-zero garbage value, then executes [ThreadedOpr::Delete(threaded_opr);](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/a3045e2e9ea59da39236f65b4c687bbcdf7fa2cd/src/engine/threaded_engine.cc#L392) and destroy an innocent object `threaded_opr` points to. (Probably also a `threaded_opr` because object pool being used)\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue.\r\n\r\ncc original author @tqchen
