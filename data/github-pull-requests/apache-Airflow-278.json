GCP, it is possible to set up [Single node clusters](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-clusters/single-node-clusters)\r\n\r\nSince the minimal size of the cluster (without this modification) is 3 (one master + two workers). It may be very helpful while doing, for example, small-scale non-critical data processing or building proof-of-concept.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests `test_build_single_node_cluster` and `test_init_with_single_node_and_non_zero_workers`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3168\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nMake sure mysql is available before calling it in CI setup\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [N/A] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNot user facing code.  Tested in local CI setup at e.g. https://travis-ci.com/dima-asana/incubator-airflow/jobs/150160744.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [N/A] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n(But no python diff so meaningless)","created_at":"2018-10-07T03:16:32Z","updated_at":"2018-10-11T08:55:16Z","closed_at":"2018-10-11T08:55:16Z","merged_at":"2018-10-11T08:55:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"7115883fafca912e46ef0d67f69320f57305bbb3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4014/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4014/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4014/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/8d77e3ea542ee6dff05d3286096d274958cb3e00","head":{"label":"Asana:airflow-3168","ref":"airflow-3168","sha":"8d77e3ea542ee6dff05d3286096d274958cb3e00","user":{"login":"Asana","id":1472111,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE0NzIxMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1472111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana","html_url":"https://github.com/Asana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":151669030,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTE2NjkwMzA=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"Asana/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Asana","id":1472111,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE0NzIxMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1472111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana","html_url":"https://github.com/Asana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asana/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Asana/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

task instances get created and scheduled based on the DAG's start date rather than their own.  This PR adds a check before creating a task instance to see that the start date is not after the execution date.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1837\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently task instances get created and scheduled based on the DAG's start date rather than their own.  This PR adds a check before creating a task instance to see that the start date is not after the execution date.  \r\n\r\nI tried this first in https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4000 but didn't realize that it's intended behavior (at least in many tests) to allow BackfillJob to run before dags'/tasks' start_date.\r\n\r\nThis commit also needed to change some view tests.  This is because these tests' setup involved running the scheduler on a date prior to the dag/task start dates.  Before this change, the task instances were created nevertheless.  In order to respect the start dates, I moved up the test setup to be consistent with the DAG start date.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nSchedulerJobTest.test_scheduler_task_start_date\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [N/A] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3155\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently the GoogleCloudStorageToGoogleCloudStorageOperator doesn't support filtering objects based on a last modified time/date. This would add the ability to further filter source object(s) to copy/move based on a last modified time threshold (for example, if the objects were updated after the last run at 10:00 yesterday, then copy/move them; otherwise, do not.) \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntest_no_prefix_with_filter_by_last_modified_true_with_false_cond\r\ntest_execute_no_prefix_with_filter_by_last_modified_false\r\ntest_no_prefix_with_filter_by_last_modified_true_with_true_cond\r\ntest_wc_with_filter_by_last_modified_false\r\ntest_wc_with_filter_by_last_modified_true_with_one_true_cond\r\ntest_wc_with_filter_by_last_modified_true_with_all_true_cond\r\ntest_execute_filter_by_last_modified\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-05T20:44:30Z","updated_at":"2018-10-15T23:16:59Z","closed_at":"2018-10-15T10:21:16Z","merged_at":"2018-10-15T10:21:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"719e0b16b909baedbc4679568548a4b123e6476a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4008/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4008/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4008/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/5622df44ffc1ae0f89753957f5b6f0871cef6a50","head":{"label":"bkvarda:gcsfilterbymod","ref":"gcsfilterbymod","sha":"5622df44ffc1ae0f89753957f5b6f0871cef6a50","user":{"login":"bkvarda","id":6834678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MzQ2Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6834678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda","html_url":"https://github.com/bkvarda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b8be322d3badfeadfa8f08e0bf92a12a6cd26418","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3162\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis is a fix for a regression on `HttpHook.get()` where if a port is specified on `airflow.models.Connection` and the provided endpoint has no leading slash, the URL will fail to parse.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# with the connection\r\nairflow.models.Connection(\r\n    conn_id='test_conn',\r\n    conn_type='http',\r\n    host='test.com',\r\n    port=1234\r\n)\r\n\r\n>>> hook = HttpHook(method='GET', http_conn_id='test_conn')\r\n>>> hook.get(endpoint='some/endpoint')\r\n...\r\nInvalidURL: Failed to parse: test.com:1234some/endpoint\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n`tests.hooks.test_http_hook:TestHttpHook.test_get_request_with_port`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-05T05:12:30Z","updated_at":"2018-10-07T14:42:16Z","closed_at":"2018-10-07T14:42:16Z","merged_at":"2018-10-07T14:42:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"a889dfb17b79162305a5e3c23c3104e71be2186f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4001/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4001/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4001/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/29275fc051a85bbe902b5021a6eef2188c8dc38c","head":{"label":"chang:fix-http-hook-port-case","ref":"fix-http-hook-port-case","sha":"29275fc051a85bbe902b5021a6eef2188c8dc38c","user":{"login":"chang","id":16146623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ2NjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16146623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang","html_url":"https://github.com/chang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":150181678,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTAxODE2Nzg=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"chang/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chang","id":16146623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ2NjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16146623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang","html_url":"https://github.com/chang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chang/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3148\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Parameters\" are normally used to help render the SQL command. But in this operator, only schema and table are needed. There is no SQL command to render.\r\n\r\nBy checking the code, we can also find argument \"parameters\" is never really used.\r\n\r\n(Fix a minor issue in the docstring as well)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR.\r\nWe were seeing an intermittent issue where executor reports task instance finished while task says it's in queue state, it was due to a race condition between scheduler which was clearing event_buffer in _process_executor_events method in jobs.py executor was about to put next_retry task's status as running which was failed in previous try. So, we thought to add retry_number as the member of TaskInstance key property.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3139\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFor all SQL-operators based on `DbApiHook`, sql command itself is printed into `log.info`. But if parameters are used for the sql command, the parameters would not be included in the printing. This makes the log less useful.\r\n\r\nThis commit ensures that the parameters are also printed into the `log.info`, if any.\r\n\r\n**Before this commit**\r\n<img width=\"1099\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-10-02 at 3 24 21 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/46335691-d94f2880-c65a-11e8-888d-5a0679a3730b.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**After this commit**\r\n(if no parameters is given for the sql command, there will be no change)\r\n<img width=\"1120\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-10-02 at 3 40 44 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/46335700-de13dc80-c65a-11e8-95ed-cf84b73ba9f5.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-02T07:42:04Z","updated_at":"2019-07-16T16:08:38Z","closed_at":"2018-10-08T14:00:15Z","merged_at":"2018-10-08T14:00:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"683dc19fe36afc0f653bdd1d10a08918d48be335","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3986/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3986/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3986/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/4d0279a03d499762216ebd0e20fa98777d31256c","head":{"label":"XD-DENG:print_sql_parameters_in_log_info","ref":"print_sql_parameters_in_log_info","sha":"4d0279a03d499762216ebd0e20fa98777d31256c","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142260154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDIyNjAxNTQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"XD-DENG/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG/airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3138\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nMigrations need to use not just the current model (with columns) as the current status of the DB but also the correct types. Go back to using basic sqlalchemy types and keep the timestamp as a timestamp without a timezone.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nRan DB migration manually against both sqlite and postgres. Following https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3720.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-01T22:19:34Z","updated_at":"2018-10-12T11:06:47Z","closed_at":"2018-10-12T11:06:47Z","merged_at":"2018-10-12T11:06:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f5e8a15e024e760efd25f99bb779e7efd0ba290","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3985/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3985/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3985/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/4d47543b6640592827410aac6175425b6d382b07","head":{"label":"noronham:master","ref":"master","sha":"4d47543b6640592827410aac6175425b6d382b07","user":{"login":"noronham","id":8620289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MjAyODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8620289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham","html_url":"https://github.com/noronham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":151155908,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTExNTU5MDg=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"noronham/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"noronham","id":8620289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MjAyODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8620289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham","html_url":"https://github.com/noronham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noronham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/noronham/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3133\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n> since there is already a flag to push to XCOM the stdout, pushing True to XCOM automatically might be too noisy for XCOM database\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nWhen the operator returns something, that value is pushed to XCOM by `xcom_push` in `base_operator.py`, when the operator returns None, nothing is pushed to XCOM\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

of invalid cron\r\nexpressions, but by default we were loading them every time we create a\r\nDagBag (which many, many tests to).\r\n\r\nInstead we ignore these known-bad dags by default, and the test checking\r\nthose (tests/models.py:DagBagTest.test_process_file_cron_validity_check)\r\nis already explicitly processing those DAGs directly, so it remains\r\ntested.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: Just makes test output a tiny bit easier to read\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-28T22:43:50Z","updated_at":"2018-10-12T08:41:45Z","closed_at":"2018-09-29T14:14:19Z","merged_at":"2018-09-29T14:14:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"7a6f4b013335d42eb7005f49ff202da147b90af1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3973/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3973/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3973/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/82ad279e794b4d2dba86cf902b7c2de112b1609a","head":{"label":"ashb:dont-spam-test-logs-with-bad-cron-expression","ref":"dont-spam-test-logs-with-bad-cron-expression","sha":"82ad279e794b4d2dba86cf902b7c2de112b1609a","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94879701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDg3OTcwMQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"ashb/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ashb/airflow","description":"Apache

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Add operators for Google Cloud Functions](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2912) issue and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nBoth Deploy and Delete operators interact with Google\r\nCloud Functions to manage functions. Both are idempotent\r\nand make use of GcfHook - hook that encapsulates\r\ncommunication with GCP over GCP API.\r\n\r\nInvoke operator is also in the works, but it waits for alpha\r\nIAM functionality that will soon be available and helps\r\nwith protecting invoke operation.\r\n\r\nPart of this commit message is also Body Field Validator\r\nthat is meant to be reusable (but for now is an integral\r\npart of GCF operators). It will be separated out into\r\nutils in one of the subsequent Pull Requests where it\r\nwill be reused in other operators (GCE ones)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests \r\n* GcfFunctionDeployTest class\r\n* GcfFunctionDeleteTest class\r\n\r\n63 tests in total (includes parameterised test) \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

Description\r\n\r\nCreating a pod that exceeds a namespace's resource quota throws an ApiException. This change catches the exception and the task is re-queued inside the Executor instead of killing the scheduler.\r\n\r\n`click 7.0` was recently released but `flask-appbuilder 1.11.1 has requirement click==6.7`. I have pinned `click==6.7` to make the dependencies resolve.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nThis adds a single test `TestKubernetesExecutor. test_run_next_exception` that covers this single scenario. Without the changes this test fails when the ApiException is not caught. \r\n\r\nThis is the first test case for the `KubernetesExecutor`,  so I needed to add the `[kubernetes]` section to

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3124) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe command `airflow webserver -d` crashes when `settings.RBAC == True`. This is because `create_app` currently returns `app, appbuilder`, which causes the app to crash with an `AttributeError`. As a side comment, it might not be ideal for the two `create_app`'s to have a difference interface, so wondering if the more proper fix is have `create_app` only return the flask application and then update the tests that rely on this to retrieve the appbuilder from the `cached_appbuilder` function. I can do that if it seems worthwhile, but figured I'd wait for feedback before doing that larger change.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests\r\n\r\nI set up the CLI to pass in the `unit_test_mode` setting to the flask app so we can disable the werkzeug reloader when running tests. If the reloader runs, there is an extra monitoring process left running after killing the main webserver process. This causes conflicts if multiple tests rely on being able to start a webserver (as the process will not be able to bind to the default socket). \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-26T23:33:54Z","updated_at":"2018-09-28T17:18:37Z","closed_at":"2018-09-28T17:10:01Z","merged_at":"2018-09-28T17:10:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"023c37ae8dc8cde812be6929957ebf6385b2a7cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3958/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3958/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3958/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/90686be4cd7ebd17376060b81f67ad1050bfeba5","head":{"label":"akosel:airflow-3124-fix-rbac-webserver-debug-mode","ref":"airflow-3124-fix-rbac-webserver-debug-mode","sha":"90686be4cd7ebd17376060b81f67ad1050bfeba5","user":{"login":"akosel","id":5097634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTc2MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5097634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel","html_url":"https://github.com/akosel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94393981,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDM5Mzk4MQ==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"akosel/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"akosel","id":5097634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTc2MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5097634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel","html_url":"https://github.com/akosel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/akosel/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

want to create connection validation when saving a connection. I started with Postgres. Would be nice to know if you agree with the PR, before I implement validation for other connection types.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3106](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3106)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds validation for the Postgres connection type. After saving a Connection, it validates by creating a new database connection and executing `SELECT 1`. In case this fails, an error is displayed:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6249654/45939662-9e9f1d80-bfd4-11e8-8057-f08acb2a9062.png)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3054\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nQueries which starts with show returning results (like \"show tables in default\", or \"show partitions in default.table_name\" and now ingnored with `if` statement. This minor change `if` statements.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason: minor change\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-24T11:44:07Z","updated_at":"2018-09-25T05:11:17Z","closed_at":"2018-09-25T04:45:14Z","merged_at":"2018-09-25T04:45:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"5248b94d745981371d454fc804ad945c10088da2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3940/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3940/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3940/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/4866f21eeae4f0a50abd9f43b827f555d20f1d3f","head":{"label":"aprotopopov:hive_hooks_sql_with_show","ref":"hive_hooks_sql_with_show","sha":"4866f21eeae4f0a50abd9f43b827f555d20f1d3f","user":{"login":"aprotopopov","id":6563045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjMwNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6563045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov","html_url":"https://github.com/aprotopopov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100350971,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDAzNTA5NzE=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"aprotopopov/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aprotopopov","id":6563045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjMwNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6563045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov","html_url":"https://github.com/aprotopopov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aprotopopov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aprotopopov/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3046\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe have ECS clusters made up of EC2 spot fleets. Among other things, this means hosts can be terminated on short notice. When this happens, all tasks (and associated containers) get terminated, as well.\r\n\r\nWe expect that when that happens for Airflow task instances using the ECS Operator, those instances will be marked as failures and retried.\r\n\r\nInstead, they are marked as successful.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the immediate downstream task fails, causing the scheduled DAG run to fail.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of the Airflow log output when this happens:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2018-09-12 01:02:02,712] {ecs_operator.py:112} INFO - ECS Task stopped, check status: {'tasks': [{'taskArn': 'arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111111111111:task/32d43a1d-fbc7-4659-815d-9133bde11cdc', 'clusterArn': 'arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111111111111:cluster/processing', 'taskDefinitionArn': 'arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111111111111:task-definition/foobar-testing_dataEngineering_rd:76', 'containerInstanceArn': 'arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111111111111:container-instance/7431f0a6-8fc5-4eff-8196-32f77d286a61', 'overrides': {'containerOverrides': [{'name': 'foobar-testing', 'command': ['./bin/generate-features.sh', '2018-09-11']}]}, 'lastStatus': 'STOPPED', 'desiredStatus': 'STOPPED', 'cpu': '4096', 'memory': '60000', 'containers': [{'containerArn': 'arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111111111111:container/0d5cc553-f894-4f9a-b17c-9f80f7ce8d0a', 'taskArn': 'arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111111111111:task/32d43a1d-fbc7-4659-815d-9133bde11cdc', 'name': 'foobar-testing', 'lastStatus': 'RUNNING', 'networkBindings': [], 'networkInterfaces': [], 'healthStatus': 'UNKNOWN'}], 'startedBy': 'Airflow', 'version': 3, 'stoppedReason': 'Host EC2 (instance i-02cf23bbd5ae26194) terminated.', 'connectivity': 'CONNECTED', 'connectivityAt': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 12, 0, 6, 30, 245000, tzinfo=tzlocal()), 'pullStartedAt': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 12, 0, 6, 32, 748000, tzinfo=tzlocal()), 'pullStoppedAt': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 12, 0, 6, 59, 748000, tzinfo=tzlocal()), 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 12, 0, 6, 30, 245000, tzinfo=tzlocal()), 'startedAt': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 12, 0, 7, 0, 748000, tzinfo=tzlocal()), 'stoppingAt': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 12, 1, 2, 0, 91000, tzinfo=tzlocal()), 'stoppedAt': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 12, 1, 2, 0, 91000, tzinfo=tzlocal()), 'group': 'family:foobar-testing_dataEngineering_rd', 'launchType': 'EC2', 'attachments': [], 'healthStatus': 'UNKNOWN'}], 'failures': [], 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': '758c791f-b627-11e8-83f7-2b76f4796ed2', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'server': 'Server', 'date': 'Wed, 12 Sep 2018 01:02:02 GMT', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '1412', 'connection': 'keep-alive', 'x-amzn-requestid': '758c791f-b627-11e8-83f7-2b76f4796ed2'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the ECS Operator to include a check for this failure condition and raise an `AirflowException`.\r\n\r\nI've also updated the `setup.py` to include `unittest2` in the `devel` section when using Python 2. The tests depend on `unittest2` being installed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3051\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe ability to manipulate users from the  command line is a bit clunky.  Currently 'airflow create_user' and 'airflow delete_user' and 'airflow list_users'.  It seems that these ought to be made more like connections, so that it becomes 'airflow users list ...', 'airflow users delete ...' and 'airflow users create ...'\r\n\r\nAfter merging this PR, `airflow users -h` in cli will result in the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nusage: airflow users [-h] [-l] [-c] [-d] [--username USERNAME] [--email EMAIL]\r\n                     [--firstname FIRSTNAME] [--lastname LASTNAME]\r\n                     [--role ROLE] [--password PASSWORD]\r\n                     [--use_random_password]\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n  -l, --list            List all users\r\n  -c, --create          Create a user\r\n  -d, --delete          Delete a user\r\n  --username USERNAME   Username of the user, required to create/delete a user\r\n  --email EMAIL         Email of the user, required to create a user\r\n  --firstname FIRSTNAME\r\n                        First name of the user, required to create a user\r\n  --lastname LASTNAME   Last name of the user, required to create a user\r\n  --role ROLE           Role of the user. Existing roles include Admin, User,\r\n                        Op, Viewer, and Public. Required to create a user\r\n  --password PASSWORD   Password of the user, required to create a user\r\n                        without --use_random_password\r\n  --use_random_password\r\n                        Do not prompt for password. Use random string instead.\r\n                        Required to create a user without --password\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nManipulated tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2548\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/199185/45848620-0bb86780-bce4-11e8-94fe-ea3df8b9c549.png)\r\n\r\nThis change displays an alert in the web interface for each ImportError that occurs on the DAGs homepage.\r\n\r\nA limitation is that the presence of the error alert reflects the brokenness of the plugin according to the webserver, not the scheduler. So, if the user fixes the plugin and restarts *only* the webserver, that web UI will not show the error anymore, but the airflow DAGs may still be broken because the scheduler also needs a restart. In other words, the plugin can be simultaneously fixed for the webserver but broken for the scheduler.  After editing the plugin's code, both the scheduler and the webserver need to be restarted.\r\n\r\nThe proposer of the Jira issue @andscoop outlined a different approach to add this feature in the Jira issue. I may be mistaken, but that approach would cause the opposite limitation, where the error alert would reflect the brokenness of the plugin according to the scheduler, not the webserver?\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nIt is unclear how I can unit test a small UI change like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\nAdded a sentence to clarify the need to restart both the webserver and the scheduler after plugin changes.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-21T00:03:05Z","updated_at":"2019-01-03T23:00:27Z","closed_at":"2019-01-02T13:11:15Z","merged_at":"2019-01-02T13:11:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"9266c0fb60ff52563d5ed406cca9dc8df09b08fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3930/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3930/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3930/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/4d41b0431aa1827fa52ddcfec8771d947f597beb","head":{"label":"jcao219:output-plugin-errors","ref":"output-plugin-errors","sha":"4d41b0431aa1827fa52ddcfec8771d947f597beb","user":{"login":"jcao219","id":199185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTE4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/199185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219","html_url":"https://github.com/jcao219","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":146810892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDY4MTA4OTI=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"jcao219/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jcao219","id":199185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTE4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/199185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219","html_url":"https://github.com/jcao219","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcao219/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jcao219/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThree parts of works were done in this commit:\r\n\r\n#### **1. A wrong sample bash command**\r\nhttps://airflow.incubator.apache.org/howto/secure-connections.html\r\n<img width=\"797\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-09-20 at 9 46 32 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/45790992-2ece2180-bcba-11e8-8f19-4737efcf29da.png\">\r\nThis sample bash command for sure would not work. It should be\r\n```bash\r\nexport AIRFLOW__CORE__FERNET_KEY=your_fernet_key\r\n```\r\n (lowercase `export` and no spaces around `=`)\r\n\r\n#### **2. A display issue**\r\nhttps://airflow.incubator.apache.org/kubernetes.html?highlight=kubernetes\r\n<img width=\"766\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-09-20 at 9 47 00 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/45790988-2c6bc780-bcba-11e8-9e73-d2e09e527fb0.png\">\r\nThere are two items, `-Dags` and `-Logs`. But because an empty line is missing in the RST file, this part is not displayed correctly.\r\n\r\nAfter the change, it should look like this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1091\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-09-20 at 9 52 17 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/45791150-f7ac4000-bcba-11e8-8125-e5c49a422331.png\">\r\n\r\n#### **3. A few typos**\r\nA few other typos in different sections.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nOnly documentation change.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-20T01:50:42Z","updated_at":"2018-09-21T10:34:51Z","closed_at":"2018-09-21T10:24:14Z","merged_at":"2018-09-21T10:24:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"4c1282c43b57f8d137fa7d23ce855542d2d53c61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3924/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3924/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3924/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/d55c814760bdfbe5918a81c4d5a12c888180affc","head":{"label":"XD-DENG:fix-doc","ref":"fix-doc","sha":"d55c814760bdfbe5918a81c4d5a12c888180affc","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142260154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDIyNjAxNTQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"XD-DENG/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG/airflow","description":"Apache

Instead, the proxy should be configured to set\r\nthe `X-Forwarded-Proto` header to `https`; Flask interprets this header\r\nand generates the appropriate callback url without hard-coding the\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.
