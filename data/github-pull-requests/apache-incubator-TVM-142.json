PR contains changes in quite a few places\r\n\r\n### Codegen Flow\r\n\r\nIR -> SplitPipeline -> pipeline annotated IR -> verilog::MakePipeline -> verilog low level ir -> CodeGenVerilog -> verilog code -> runtime\r\n\r\nRelated codes:\r\n\r\n- Pipeline Annotated IR\r\n   - [src/pass/split_pipeline.cc](https://github.com/tqchen/tvm/blob/tqchen/src/pass/split_pipeline.cc)\r\n- Verilog Low Level IR\r\n   - [src/codegen/verilog/verilog_ir.h](https://github.com/tqchen/tvm/blob/tqchen/src/codegen/verilog/verilog_ir.h)\r\n  - Low level IR contains compute blocks that are connected by channels(which can be buffer, RAM, FIFO)\r\n  - It also contains loop structure, and trigger signals(which triggers buffer advance and done)\r\n\r\n### Codegen Workflow\r\nEach codegen of compute block will generate the data path, the loop structure.  \r\n- Synchronization logic is done by checking valid signal from all input and send back the ready in the current cycle.\r\n   - This is inefficient as per discussed with @tmoreau89 . To solve this problem we can add cache registers in the inputs, which makes the control signal smaller.\r\n- All the trigger signal, data, valid is delayed by the ***same amount of cycles***, before feed into write buffer\r\n   - There is currently no delay model of expression, ideally we should have a pass on expressions to get the estimated delay, this can be done in a followup PR.\r\n- Indexed load are splitted into a separate stage, so C[i] = A[i]+1 contains two stages, the first stage loads A[i] and put it into a FIFO, the second stage load the data from FIFO, plus 1 and store to C\r\n    - Currently FIFO is implemented with cached register\r\n- Stall signal is derived from ready signal of the write buffer, when it stalls, it stalls the delayed registers.\r\n- The signal ports of channels are directly put into a map, and channels are generated later\r\n- The channels are generated by instantiate modules with connections specified in the port map.\r\n\r\nWhen a function is invoked, a main function will be generated to hookup the compiled modules as well as simulated RAM.\r\n- The load/write into RAM currently is cheated by using a vpi_mmap.\r\n\r\n### Runtime Simulator Hook\r\n When a code is generated, it is hooked by https://github.com/tqchen/tvm/blob/tqchen/python/tvm/addon/verilog.py#L263  which set the arguments into registers and start reset signal\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-24T19:59:01Z","updated_at":"2017-03-26T01:26:29Z","closed_at":"2017-03-26T01:26:29Z","merged_at":"2017-03-26T01:26:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"df6fcc509c6475ff39ea6a4f98a05cc80b19398e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/74/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/74/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/74/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/46e145ef8f31fcc6a258892a0a38da60710060d7","head":{"label":"apache:tqchen","ref":"tqchen","sha":"46e145ef8f31fcc6a258892a0a38da60710060d7","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70746484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDc0NjQ4NA==","name":"tvm","full_name":"apache/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm","description":"Open

Introduce the scan operator\r\nThe following code compute the cumsum of X\r\n```python\r\ndef my_cumsum():\r\n   m = tvm.Var(\"m\")\r\n    n = tvm.Var(\"n\")\r\n    t = tvm.IterVar((1, m),

should always ensure only refer to previous timestamp\r\n- Do not yet allow subslice result of scan, need to add fix point detection to allow subslice axis that are simple(only refers to itself during recursion)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fix in Canonical\r\nPreviously did not multiple constant by -1 during sub, making ```m-1``` to ```m+1```, added a regression test.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-13T01:53:25Z","updated_at":"2017-02-14T00:39:08Z","closed_at":"2017-02-14T00:39:08Z","merged_at":"2017-02-14T00:39:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"820a85975f09ce5eb2aaad0df3496e69874f3b80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/43/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/43/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/43/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/595dc9485fce8f65c2f79e562fe3c82a91c7aa23","head":{"label":"apache:tqchen","ref":"tqchen","sha":"595dc9485fce8f65c2f79e562fe3c82a91c7aa23","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70746484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDc0NjQ4NA==","name":"tvm","full_name":"apache/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm","description":"Open
