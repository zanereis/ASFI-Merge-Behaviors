View lock contention\r\n2. Observe existence of concurrent locks\r\n3. Augment and replace the existing /lockedIntervals API \r\n4. Miscellaneous debugging\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n1. Remove the existing deprecated API to view locked intervals: `/lockedIntervals`\r\n2. Augment lock filter policy to take a list of intervals\r\n3. Add an API to view task locks given a set of filters instead: `/activeLocks`\r\n4.

patch is a follow-up to #16168, adding worker-side support for in-memory shuffles. Changes include:\r\n\r\n1) Worker-side code now respects the same context parameter \"maxConcurrentStages\"\r\n   that was added to the controller in #16168. The parameter remains undocumented\r\n   for now, to give us a chance to more fully develop and test this functionality.\r\n\r\n1) WorkerImpl is broken up into WorkerImpl, RunWorkOrder, and RunWorkOrderListener\r\n   to improve readability.\r\n\r\n2) WorkerImpl has a new StageOutputHolder + StageOutputReader concept, which\r\n   abstract over memory-based or file-based stage results.\r\n\r\n3) RunWorkOrder is updated to create in-memory stage output channels when\r\n   instructed to.\r\n\r\n4) ControllerResource is updated to add /doneReadingInput/, so the controller\r\n   can tell when workers that sort, but do not gather statistics, are done reading\r\n   their inputs.\r\n\r\n5) WorkerMemoryParameters is updated to consider maxConcurrentStages.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, WorkerChatHandler is split into WorkerResource, so as to match ControllerChatHandler and ControllerResource.","created_at":"2024-07-24T10:29:06Z","updated_at":"2024-10-04T06:34:16Z","closed_at":"2024-07-31T01:41:25Z","merged_at":"2024-07-31T01:41:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"01f6cfcbf5de7147d2d6e350ea9769fe8d870cdc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\nThe validation added in #15920 should make this relatively safe to do. Some ingestions that are based on the old 'mvd' mode syntax which implicitly changed `ARRAY<STRING>` types to `STRING` might fail, but there is a descriptive error message and the fix is pretty easy.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nMSQ ingestion context flag `arrayIngestMode` now defaults to `array` instead of `mvd`. This means that SQL `VARCHAR ARRAY` types will no longer be implicitly translated and stored into `VARCHAR` columns, but will instead be stored as `VARCHAR ARRAY`. Additionally it permits other array types such as `BIGINT ARRAY` and `DOUBLE ARRAY` to be inserted with MSQ into their respective array column types (instead of failing as they do in `mvd` mode). To continue to store multi-value strings modify any insert/replace queries to wrap the array types with the `ARRAY_TO_MV` operator. Validation is in place that will prevent mixing `VARCHAR` and `VARCHAR ARRAY` columns in the same table, so any ingestions affected by this change will fail and provide a descriptive error message instead of silently doing something unexpected. See https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/multi-value-dimensions#sql-based-ingestion for additional information about how to ingest multi-value strings, and https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/arrays#sql-based-ingestion for additional information about arrays.\r\n\r\nAdditionally `arrayIngestMode` option of `none` has been removed. It was introduced prior to the table validation logic as a means for cluster operators to force query writers to explicitly set `array` or `mvd` on their query contexts, but provides little utility in Druid 31.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR

<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/5695\">#5695</a>: Upgrade Fabric8 Kubernetes Model to Kubernetes v1.30.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><em><strong>Note</strong></em>: Breaking changes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/5947\">#5947</a>: CRD generation using the v1beta1 version is deprecated. Please use only v1 instead.</li>\n<li>Fix <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/5960\">#5960</a>: The KubernetesSerializer will now by default serialize time related types to strings - rather than object, integer, number, or arrays of integer / number. If you are using these types in a custom object and were not including JsonFormat annotations to adjust the serialization they were likely being serialized in a non-standard way that would not be usable other Kubernetes clients, nor match the generated custom resource definition if one was being produced.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, we are passing all operator factories (NaiveSort, NaivePartition, Window) in the list of operator factories for window stage definition.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we shouldn’t have to pass anything except the window factories, since sorting and partitioning are expected to be handled by the shuffle spec of the previous stage.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the change to pass only the window operator factories for window stage definition. Making this change unraveled a bug where the logic for finding shuffle spec for next window stage was incorrect.\r\n\r\n**Description of the above-mentioned bug:** For finding shuffle spec, we shouldn't be filtering out based on the partition columns. For queries having a window function like:\r\n```sql\r\nrow_number() over (partition by array[1,2,length(cityName)] order by countryName) as c\r\n```\r\nWe get the SortOperator with both columns (`array[1,2,length(cityName)]`, `countryName`), and we get the partition operator with only `array[1,2,length(cityName)]`. With the current logic, we would've gotten rid of the `countryName` from the shuffle spec, as it wasn't in the partition factory --- which is incorrect.\r\n\r\nThe reason this wasn't broken in the current code (and gets unraveled with this PR's code changes) is that we were explicitly passing the original sort and partitioning operators in the window stage definition, hence overriding the behavior of the above incorrectly evaluated shuffle spec.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

a new revised IT group `BackwardCompatibilityMain`. The idea is to catch potential backward compatibility issues that may arise during rolling upgrade. \r\n\r\nThis test group runs a docker-compose cluster with Overlord & Coordinator service on the previous druid version. \r\n\r\nFollowing env vars are required in the GHA file `.github/workflows/unit-and-integration-tests-unified.yml` to run this test\r\n```\r\nDRUID_PREVIOUS_VERSION -> Previous druid version to test backward incompatibility.\r\nDRUID_PREVIOUS_VERSION_DOWNLOAD_URL -> URL to fetch the tar. \r\n```\r\n\r\nNote, that this test group will remain disabled on Apache until we find a way to host druid tar in a separate location. \r\n\r\n#### Limitations \r\n* `druid-testing-tools` jar is not published. The image for the previous version still uses the \r\nextension from the current build. This could break in case of incompatible changes in this extension. \r\nIn such a scenario the test should be disabled. However, this extension is primarily used to\r\ntest specific error scenarios and launch custom node role service (used in HighAvailability test group).\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

Description\r\n\r\nFollow-up to https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16291, this PR enables a subset of existing native compaction ITs on the MSQ engine. In the process, the following changes are introduced in the MSQ compaction flow:\r\n\r\n- Populates `metricsSpec` in `CompactionState` from `querySpec` in `MSQControllerTask` instead of `dataSchema`\r\n- Adds check for pre-rolled-up segments having `AggregatorFactory` with different input and output column names\r\n- Fixes passing missing cluster-by clause in scan queries\r\n- Adds annotation of `CompactionState` to tombstone segments\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

moves nested field value column serializer initialization, call to `writeValue` method to `GlobalDictionaryEncodedFieldColumnWriter.writeTo` instead of during `GlobalDictionaryEncodedFieldColumnWriter.addValue`. This shift means these numeric value columns are now done in the per field section that happens after serializing the nested column raw data, so only a single compression buffer and temp file will be needed at a time instead of the total number of nested literal fields present in the column. This should be especially helpful for complicated nested structures with thousands of columns as even those 64k compression buffers can add up pretty quickly to a sizeable chunk of direct memory.\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-22T06:44:31Z","updated_at":"2024-10-04T06:35:56Z","closed_at":"2024-07-23T04:14:30Z","merged_at":"2024-07-23T04:14:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"b645d09c5dc5791e538532efbd44e203e005a9fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":648734860,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NDg3MzQ4NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Segment%20Format%20and%20Ser/De","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nAuto-compaction currently poses several challenges as it:\r\n1. may get stuck on a failing interval.\r\n2. may get stuck on the latest interval if more data keeps coming into it.\r\n3. always picks the latest interval regardless of the level of compaction in it.\r\n4. may never pick a datasource if its intervals are not very recent.\r\n5. requires setting an explicit period which does not cater to the changing needs of a Druid cluster.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces various improvements to compaction scheduling to tackle the above problems.\r\n\r\n## Change Summary\r\n\r\n1. Run compaction for a datasource as a supervisor of type `autocompact` on Overlord.\r\n2. Make compaction policy extensible and configurable.\r\n3. Track status of recently submitted compaction tasks and pass this info to policy.\r\n4. Add `/simulate` API on both Coordinator and Overlord to run compaction simulations.\r\n5. Redirect compaction status APIs to the Overlord when compaction supervisors are enabled.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n#### 1. Enable compaction to run as supervisors\r\n<details>\r\n<summary><code>druid.supervisor.compaction.enabled=true</code></summary>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n- Set the above property in the `runtime.properties` for Overlord\r\n- This property is `false` by default.\r\n- No period needs to be specified as compaction supervisors run and trigger compaction as soon as compaction slots become available.\r\n- When the above property is set to `true`\r\n  - Coordinator does not run auto-compaction duty.\r\n  - Coordinator redirects compaction progress APIs to the leader Overlord instead.\r\n- When the above property is set to `false` (default)\r\n  - Compaction supervisors do not run but supervisors may still be created, updated or deleted\r\n  - Overlord returns 504 (service unavailable) response on compaction progress APIs  \r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n__NOTE: This does not migrate existing compaction configs to the new supervisor flow.__\r\n\r\n#### 2. Submit a compaction supervisor\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\n     <b>POST</b> <code>/druid/indexer/v1/supervisor</code>\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nSample payload:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n   \"type\": \"autocompact\",    // required\r\n   \"suspended\": false,         // optional\r\n   \"spec\": {                           // required\r\n       \"dataSource\": \"wikipedia\",          // required\r\n       \"tuningConfig\": {...},                    // optional\r\n       \"granularitySpec\": {...},               // optional\r\n       ... other fields supported in compaction config ...\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n#### 3. Suspend a compaction supervisor\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\n<b>POST</b> <code>/druid/indexer/v1/supervisor/{id}/suspend</code>\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n- This suspends the compaction supervisor i.e. no more compaction tasks would be submitted for this datasource.\r\n- Once suspended, the supervisor may not report compacted stats correctly.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n#### 4. Resume a compaction supervisor\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\n<b>POST</b> <code>/druid/indexer/v1/supervisor/{id}/resume</code>\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n#### 5.

Run compaction for a datasource as a supervisor of type `autocompact` on Overlord.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary><b>Why run compaction as a supervisor?</b></summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n- The job of a supervisor is to manage indexing tasks of a certain type and react to changes in the cluster.\r\nAuto-compaction performs this same duty for tasks of type `compact`.\r\n- Polling task statuses becomes inexpensive since the info is already cached on the Overlord.\r\n- Auto-compaction can receive task update notifications from `TaskRunner` and be more reactive in nature.\r\n- Leverage existing supervisor mechanism and APIs that align perfectly to the use case:\r\n  - suspend/resume compaction\r\n  - get compaction stats\r\n  - monitor compaction health\r\n  - update compaction spec\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary><b>Add <code>OverlordCompactionScheduler</code> to manage compaction on the leader Overlord</b></summary>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n- Manages compaction of all active supervisors\r\n- Polls segments from the metadata store and builds a timeline to identify compactible segments.\r\nThis may lead to some increase in memory footprint of Overlord.\r\n- Runs the `CompactSegments` duty every 5 seconds to identify compactible intervals across all datasources.\r\n   - Using the `CompactSegments` duty ensures that the logic remains unchanged from traditional auto-compaction.\r\n- Uses `LocalOverlordClient` which redirects all queries to `TaskQueryTool` or `TaskQueue`. In traditional auto-compaction, these queries are HTTP API calls from Coordinator to the Overlord.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### 2. Make compaction policy extensible and configurable.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary><b>Policy can now be easily extended and specified as a cluster-level dynamic config.</b></summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThe base policy is `PriorityBasedSegmentSearchPolicy`.\r\nA concrete policy can choose to implement the following methods:\r\n- `getSegmentComparator()` to prioritize between segments and intervals\r\n- `shouldSkipCompaction()` to completely skip a set of segments/intervals if say\r\n   - interval was compacted recently, or\r\n   - compaction tasks for interval are failing repeatedly due to corrupt data, or\r\n   - interval has very segments that require compaction, etc.\r\n- `priorityDatasource`. Other datasources are picked for compaction only after __all__ the eligible intervals of the priority datasource have been compacted.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary><b>Policy <code>newestSegmentFirst</code></b></summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n- There are no functional changes to the default behaviour of the `newestSegmentFirst` policy.\r\n- It continues to be the default policy picked for compaction.\r\n- It supports declaring a `priorityDatasource`.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary><b>Policy <code>smallestSegmentFirst</code></b></summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n- This is a new experimental policy and has been added merely to demonstrate how new policies can be written.\r\n- Supports `priorityDatasource`\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### 3. Track status of recently submitted compaction tasks and pass this info to policy\r\n\r\n- Add `CompactionStatusTracker` that tracks status of recently submitted and completed compaction tasks.\r\n- This info can be used by the `shouldSkipCompaction()` method of the segment search policy.\r\n- Intervals for which tasks have been recently submitted and are still running are always skipped.\r\n\r\n### 4. Add `/simulate` API to run compaction simulations\r\n\r\n- Simulates a run of the `CompactSegments` duty assuming unlimited task slots\r\n- Users can see the which intervals are already compacted, skipped or queued for compaction, etc.\r\n- Users can see how the duty will behave with a new compaction dynamic config before even persisting the change.\r\n- Makes debugging easier in case compaction seems to be stuck or misbehaving.\r\n\r\n### 5. Redirect compaction status APIs to the Overlord when compaction supervisor is enabled\r\n\r\nOverlord exposes a new API `/druid/indexer/v1/compaction/isSupervisorEnabled` which can be used by\r\nthe leader Coordinator to determine if compaction is enabled to run as a supervisor.\r\nIf this API returns true, the Coordinator does not run the auto-compaction duty at all and redirects the\r\ncompaction progress APIs `/compaction/status` and `/compaction/progress` to Overlord instead.\r\n\r\n## Main classes to review\r\n- `CompactionSupervisor`\r\n- `CompactionScheduler`\r\n- `OverlordCompactionScheduler`\r\n- `CompactionStatusTracker`\r\n- `PriorityBasedSegmentSearchPolicy`\r\n- `CompactionRunSimulator`\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- [x] Small local Druid cluster\r\n- [x] Unit tests\r\n- [ ] Integration tests\r\n- [ ] Large Druid cluster\r\n\r\n## Pending items\r\n- [ ] Ensure that `LocalOverlordClient` does not hit the metadata store too often\r\n\r\n## Release note\r\n\r\n- [ ] Pending\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

removes `druid.indexer.task.batchProcessingMode` in favor of always using `CLOSED_SEGMENT_SINKS` which uses `BatchAppenderator`. This was intended to become the default for native batch, but that was missed so `CLOSED_SEGMENTS` was the default (using `AppenderatorImpl`), however MSQ has been exclusively using `BatchAppenderator` with no problems so it seems safe to just roll it out as the only option for batch ingestion everywhere.\r\n* with `batchProcessingMode` gone, there is no use for `AppenderatorImpl` so it has been removed\r\n* simplify `Appenderator` construction since there are only separate stream and batch versions now\r\n* simplify tests since `batchProcessingMode` is

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nOverlord guice dependencies are currently a little difficult to plug into.\r\nThis was encountered while working on a separate PR where a class needed to depend\r\non `TaskMaster.getTaskQueue()`  to query some task related info but this class itself\r\nneeds to be a dependency of `TaskMaster` so that it can be registered to the leader lifecycle.\r\n\r\nThe approach taken here is to simply decouple the leadership lifecycle of the overlord from manipulation\r\nor querying of its state.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- No functional change\r\n- Add new class `DruidOverlord` to contain leadership logic after the model of `DruidCoordinator`\r\n- The new class `DruidOverlord` should not be a dependency of any class with the exception of REST endpoint\r\n`*Resource` classes.\r\n- All classes that need to listen to leadership changes must be a dependency of `DruidOverlord` so\r\nthat they can be registered to the leadership lifecycle.\r\n- Move all querying logic from `OverlordResource` to `TaskQueryTool` so that other classes can leverage this\r\nlogic too (required for follow up PR).\r\n- Update tests\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to

added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\n#### 1. Bug in TaskStorageQueryAdapter\r\n#15377 introduced a change to fetch task payloads from memory.\r\n\r\nBut it keeps a reference to the `TaskQueue` when `TaskStorageQueryAdapter` is being constructed.\r\n\r\nThe `TaskQueue` object is recreated upon every leader election.\r\nSo, effectively, if a node becomes a leader again, it would use the older instance of the `TaskQueue`\r\nfrom when it had first become the leader.\r\n\r\nBut that old instance of `TaskQueue` would not have information of new tasks and would eventually fall back\r\nto fetching stuff from metadata storage, rendering the caching layer useless.\r\n\r\nAlso, memory leaks.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Broken master\r\n\r\n#16309  removed the method `TaskAction.isAudited()`. Some task actions still have this method causing compilation failure.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Do not hold a reference to `TaskQueue` in `TaskStorageQueryAdapter`\r\n- Use `TaskStorage` instead of `TaskStorageQueryAdapter` in `IndexerMetadataStorageAdapter`\r\n- Rename `TaskStorageQueryAdapter` to `TaskQueryTool`\r\n- Fix newly added task actions `RetrieveUpgradedFromSegmentIds` and `RetrieveUpgradedToSegmentIds`\r\nby removing `isAudited` method.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

`ParallelMergeCombiningSequence` to more aggressively use the cancellation mechanism whenever errors are encountered in an effort to shutdown processing as quickly as possible across fork join pool actions.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the timeout for operations of pushing or fetching items from a `BlockingQueue` is now fixed at 500ms instead of the query timeout, to better play with the fork join pool managed blocking by returning true to indicate additional blocking is necessary, which in tests seems to be a lot better behaved.\r\n\r\nLastly, `CachingClusteredClient` now wires `ParallelMergeCombiningSequence` into the `QueryScheduler` to be able to participate in cancellation. `ParallelMergeCombiningSequence` now exposes a `ListenableFuture` to register with `QueryScheduler` that wraps around the cancel stuff used to stop processing internally

Description\r\n\r\nAfter allowing complex dimensions to be grouped, we have seen a regression in queries that operate on large amounts of data which is solely due to the [custom deserialization](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16511) that has been added. After investigation, it looks like that happens because deserializing everything in a single go is a lot faster than deserializing individual dimensions, due to the additional overhead involved with Jackson deserialization when trying to parse a value. While the patch mentioned is important for allowing grouping on complex dimensions, this PR aims to improve the performance of the deserializing code. Equally importantly, I have duplicated the logic for deserialization to make the hot loop more effective, and if the query doesn't contain any complex dimensions (or nested columns), we resort to the original logic to remove any regression that was introduced by the linked patch. \r\n\r\nThis regression was originally discovered in a query that takes about 5 minutes to complete, and transfers a lot of data between the historicals and the broker as a part of the grouping process. The time before and after introducing the regressing patch increased from 270 seconds to 330 seconds. \r\n\r\nFollowing improvements are made to the \r\n\r\n1. **Reuse deserialization context** - This will reduce the overhead of creating a new deserialization context every time while calling `jp.readValueAs(...)`, which is per entity, per row. This change alone reduces the time taken by the query by 10-20 seconds.\r\n\r\n3. **Use JavaType instead of Class** - This is another free bit of optimization that can help with the runtime. Class is converted into JavaType before the mapper deserializes the value. Directly having the JavaType ready means that the per entity deserialization doesn't have to incur this cost. \r\n\r\n4. **Remove conditionals from the hot loop** - This patch tries to make the hot loop as efficient as possible by removing the conditionals from the serde code. \r\n\r\n5. **Have redundant serializers and deserializers** - Depending on backward compatibility and if the query has complex dimensions, serde logic can have many conditionals. This patch breaks those conditionals out so that the hot loop is more optimized than before. \r\n\r\n6. **Skip cloning and decorating the mapper** - This patch introduces back the original code we had - if there isn't any backward compatibility to take care off, skip cloning the mapper and adding custom serde logic to it - with a minor change. We skip cloning if we don't have to worry about backward compatibility _and_ we don't have any complex dimension. \r\n\r\n7. **Treat JSON columns differently from other complex types** - JSON columns are complex types that can be optimised due to the fact that they can directly operate on the deserialized types. Therefore they can bypass all the logic of custom serde required for complex dimensions. This optimises the handling of nested types, which is one of the major group of complex columns that need to be grouped upon.\r\n\r\n### Benchmarking the `readValue` call on `ResultRow`\r\n\r\n* Current master (after regression)\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                              (backwardCompatibility)      (complexDimensionType)  (numDimensions)  (primitiveToComplexDimensionRatio)  Mode  Cnt   Score   Error  Units\r\nGroupByDeserializationBenchmark.deserializeResultRows                     true                        json              100                                   0  avgt    5  30.200 ± 0.470  us/op\r\nGroupByDeserializationBenchmark.deserializeResultRows                     true                        json              100                                 0.5  avgt    5  18.732 ± 0.316  us/op\r\nGroupByDeserializationBenchmark.deserializeResultRows                     true                        json              100                                 1.0  avgt    5   5.774 ± 0.043  us/op\r\nGroupByDeserializationBenchmark.deserializeResultRows                     true  serializablePairLongString              100                                   0  avgt    5  30.384 ± 0.681  us/op\r\nGroupByDeserializationBenchmark.deserializeResultRows                     true  serializablePairLongString              100                                 0.5  avgt    5  19.705 ± 0.450  us/op\r\nGroupByDeserializationBenchmark.deserializeResultRows                     true  serializablePairLongString              100                                 1.0  avgt    5   5.565 ± 0.083  us/op\r\nGroupByDeserializationBenchmark.deserializeResultRows                    false                        json              100                                   0  avgt    5  31.146 ± 0.256  us/op\r\nGroupByDeserializationBenchmark.deserializeResultRows                    false                        json              100                                 0.5  avgt    5  19.404 ± 1.294  us/op\r\nGroupByDeserializationBenchmark.deserializeResultRows                    false                        json              100                                 1.0  avgt    5   5.681 ± 0.024  us/op\r\nGroupByDeserializationBenchmark.deserializeResultRows                    false  serializablePairLongString              100                                   0  avgt    5  30.445 ± 0.696  us/op\r\nGroupByDeserializationBenchmark.deserializeResultRows                    false  serializablePairLongString              100                                 0.5  avgt    5  19.345 ± 0.361  us/op\r\nGroupByDeserializationBenchmark.deserializeResultRows                    false  serializablePairLongString              100                                 1.0  avgt    5   5.608 ± 0.229  us/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Before the regression\r\n(Note that tests on `serializablePairLongString` are not representative of the performance we should expect, due to the additional overhead of serializing to the correct type.

Description\r\n\r\n`NewestSegmentFirstIterator` has a lot of code which may be commoned out if we want to implement other types\r\nof compaction search policies. The changes in this PR create a common iterator which may be given any comparator\r\nto prioritize between compactible segments.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Break `NewestSegmentFirstIterator` into two parts\r\n  - `DatasourceCompactibleSegmentIterator` - this contains all of the code originally in `NewestSegmentFirstIterator`\r\n  but now handles a single datasource and allows a priority to be specified\r\n  - `PriorityBasedCompactionSegmentIterator` - contains separate iterator for each datasource and combines the\r\n  results into a single queue to be used by a compaction search policy\r\n- Update `NewestSegmentFirstPolicy` to use the above new classes\r\n- Cleanup `CompactionStatistics` and `AutoCompactionSnapshot`\r\n- Cleanup `CompactSegments`\r\n- Remove unused methods from `Tasks`\r\n- Remove unneeded `TasksTest`\r\n- Move tests from `NewestSegmentFirstIteratorTest` to `CompactionStatusTest`\r\nand `DatasourceCompactibleSegmentIteratorTest`\r\n\r\n### Main classes to review\r\n- `DatasourceCompactibleSegmentIterator`\r\n- `CompactSegments`\r\n- `PriorityBasedCompactionSegmentIterator`\r\n\r\n### Planned follow up work\r\n- Add other types of segment search policies to compare performance with `NewestSegmentFirstPolicy`.\r\n- Simplify tracking of compaction stats.\r\n- Further cleanup of these classes. This PR has left some unnecessary code blocks in place to allow for a smooth review.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases\">io.grpc:grpc-netty-shaded's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.65.1</h2>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>netty: Restore old behavior of NettyAdaptiveCumulator, but avoid using that class if Netty is on version 4.1.111 or later</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v1.65.0</h2>\n<p>grpc-netty in this release is compatible with Netty 4.1.111; it fixes the incompatibility that caused data corruption. grpc-netty-shaded is still using Netty 4.1.100.</p>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>New module grpc-gcp-csm-observability (df8cfe9dd)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>api: Add <code>ClientStreamTracer.inboundHeaders(Metadata)</code> (960012d76). This is the same as the existing <code>inboundHeaders()</code>, but is provided the Metadata</li>\n<li>api: Fix various typos in the documentation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11144\">#11144</a>) (6ec744f2a)</li>\n<li>core: When queuing RPCs, don’t request picks from the LB twice (8844cf7b8). This could be viewed as a small performance optimization, but mainly reduces the amount of race-handling code</li>\n<li>util: Improve AdvancedTlsX509KeyManager’s documentation, verification, and testing. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11139\">#11139</a>) (781b4c457) This change shows <code>@ExperimentalApi</code> being removed, but it was re-added in 3c97245 before the release</li>\n<li>examples: Fix broken command in reflection readme (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11131\">#11131</a>) (c31dbf48a)</li>\n<li>binder: Add a connection timeout (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11255\">#11255</a>) (791f894e2)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>core: Exit idle mode when delayed transport is in use (fea577c80). This was a long-standing race that could cause RPCs to hang, but was very unlikely to be hit. Avoiding the double-picking (8844cf7b8) made the race more visible</li>\n<li>netty: Fix Netty composite buffer merging to be compatible with Netty 4.1.111 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11294\">#11294</a>) (0fea7dd). The previous behavior easily caused data corruption</li>\n<li>okhttp: Workaround SSLSocket not noticing socket is closed (a28357e19). Previously, shutting down when a new connection was being established could result in the server never becoming terminated</li>\n<li>inprocess: Fix listener race if transport is shutdown while starting (e4e7f3a06). This issue was unlikely to be hit outside of specialized tests</li>\n<li>services: restore //services:binarylog bazel target (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11292\">#11292</a>) (d57f271). This fixes a regression introduced in 1.62.2</li>\n<li>binder: Wait for all server transports to terminate before returning the security policy executor to the object pool (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11240\">#11240</a>) (34ee600dc)</li>\n<li>binder: Reject further SETUP_TRANSPORT requests post-BinderServer shutdown (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11260\">#11260</a>) (1670e97f7)</li>\n<li>bazel: Include missing com_google_protobuf_javalite in MODULE.bazel (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11147\">#11147</a>) (f995c121e)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Thanks to</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/hakusai22\"><code>@​hakusai22</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/firov\"><code>@​firov</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mateusazis\"><code>@​mateusazis</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Mir3605\"><code>@​Mir3605</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/niloc132\"><code>@​niloc132</code></a></p>\n<h2>v1.64.2</h2>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>netty: Restore old behavior of NettyAdaptiveCumulator, but avoid using that class if Netty is on version 4.1.111 or later</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v1.64.1</h2>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>netty:Fix Netty composite buffer merging to be compatible with Netty 4.1.111 (1.64.x backport) by <a href=\"https://github.com/larry-safran\"><code>@​larry-safran</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/11303\">grpc/grpc-java#11303</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v1.64.0</h2>\n<p><em>Avoid upgrading your application to Netty 4.1.111, as there is a possible corruption.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes some issues with MSQ window functions.\r\n\r\n## Issue 1: NPE issues when multiple windows are used\r\nCurrently, queries like the following run into a NPE when using MSQ:\r\n```sql\r\nselect countryName, cityName, channel, \r\nrow_number() over (partition by cityName order by countryName, cityName, channel) as c1, \r\ncount(channel) over (partition by cityName order by countryName, cityName, channel) as c2\r\nfrom wikipedia\r\nwhere countryName in ('Austria', 'Republic of Korea')\r\ngroup by countryName, cityName, channel\r\n```\r\nbecause the `List<OperatorFactory>` we get in `WindowOperatorQueryKit` layer is `[Sort, Partition, Window1, Window2]`.\r\n\r\nWindowOperatorQueryKit was trying to group the window factories into different groups, and was asserting a partition operator factory to be present in each group, which wasn't valid, and ended up giving NPE.\r\n\r\n## Issue 2: Query correctness issues because of incorrect trimming of row signature\r\nCurrently, queries like the following give incorrect results when using MSQ:\r\n```sql\r\nselect cityName, countryName,\r\nrow_number() over (partition by countryName order by countryName, cityName, channel) as c1,\r\ncount(channel) over (partition by cityName order by countryName, cityName, channel) as c2\r\nfrom wikipedia\r\nwhere countryName in ('Austria', 'Republic of Korea')\r\ngroup by countryName, cityName, channel\r\n```\r\nbecause we are incorrectly trimming the row signature in `WindowOperatorQueryKit` in the following part of code:\r\n```java\r\n      final int numberOfWindows = operatorList.size();\r\n      final int baseSize = rowSignature.size() - numberOfWindows;\r\n      for (int i = 0; i < baseSize; i++) {\r\n        bob.add(rowSignature.getColumnName(i), rowSignature.getColumnType(i).get());\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      for (int i = 0; i < numberOfWindows; i++) {\r\n        bob.add(rowSignature.getColumnName(baseSize + i), rowSignature.getColumnType(baseSize + i).get()).build();\r\n        // rest of the code\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nIssue 1 is fixed by removing the assertion, and returning null when no partition operator factory is present for the current window stage evaluation. This indicates  that we already have the data partitioned correctly, and hence we don't need to do any shuffling.\r\n\r\nIssue 2 is fixed by revamping the logic of computing the row signature for every window stage. Changes done to achieve this:\r\n1. Added a `getOutputColumnNames()` method in `Processor` interface\r\n2. Calculating the list of partition column names for a given window stage, and passing that list to the window processor layer, for usage in `WindowOperatorQueryFrameProcessor#comparePartitionKeys`.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\n1. Added DruidWindowQueryTest and MSQDruidWindowQueryTest, which use the same wiring done in DrillWindowQueryTest and MSQDrillWindowQueryTest. The common functionality was moved into a base class `WindowQueryTestBase`. We decided to create a new layer as we didn't want to add non-drill tests into the existing drill test layer.\r\n2. Added a few category of tests in DruidWindowQueryTest (and hence also in MSQDruidWindowQueryTest).\r\n3. Did a lot of manual testing as well.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `WindowOperatorQueryKit`\r\n * `WindowOperatorQueryFrameProcessor `\r\n * Test files: `DruidWindowQueryTest `, `MSQDruidWindowQueryTest`, `DrillWindowQueryTest`, `MSQDrillWindowQueryTest`, `WindowQueryTestBase`\r\n\r\n## Release Note\r\n\r\nThis change is backwards incompatible, and can cause issues for MSQ queries with window functions during the upgrade.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#16717\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHadoop ingestion doesnt have access to K8s config. Provider not being pure lazy was making the HadoopIndexTask fail altho it doesnt really need K8s information on the Hadoop cluster.\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the DruidLeaderSelectorProvider class so its creation can be deferred to Module instantiation, thus not happening on HadoopIndexTask\r\n\r\nIt creates 2 subclasses CoordinatorDruidLeaderSelectorProvider and IndexingServiceDruidLeaderSelectorProvider which can be properly referenced.\r\n\r\n\r\nWas not sure about either overriding the get method on children or keep the parents, so i decided to take the option with less code changes.\r\nLet me know if the other option id preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * Fixed: Hadoop ingestion now works on k8s deployments\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ X] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nFixes of #16690, but tries to instead fix the attempted behavior of coercing `[]` into `[null]` for `UnnestDimensionCursor` to be less disruptive while we determine what the correct behavior for unnest on `[]` for a multi-value string actually is. For regular arrays, `[]` is skipped per the standard, but for MVDs it looks like the `UnnestDimensionCursor` was trying to match group-by behavior. Idk if matching group-by behavior is correct, but the way it was doing it was totally wrong if `null` wasn't id 0 in the dictionary (or if the dictionary had no nulls at all). This PR fixes that by using the idLookup of the underlying dimension selector to lookup the null value id, and if present, using that, and if not, creating a synthetic nullId at position 0 and offsetting all of the real dictionary ids by 1 as we have done in some other places for other reasons (e.g. adapters for default value mode when segments were written in SQL compatible null handling mode).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Problem\r\nCurrently, there is a fairness problem in the `KillUnusedSegments` duty where the duty consistently selects the same set of datasources as discovered from the metadata store or dynamic config parameters. This is particularly problematic when there are a steady stream of unused segments created by retention rules and fewer kill task slots. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\nTo address the fairness problem, this patch introduces a sorted `CircularList` that provides a round-robin iterator for selecting datasources to kill. The kill duty also tracks the previously killed datasource to avoid selecting consecutive duplicate datasources, provided there are other datasources available. This optimization is especially beneficial for smaller clusters where task slots are limited by default. When the set of datasources changes during a kill run, the circular list instance is refreshed; otherwise, the previous state is resumed.\r\n\r\nA few other heuristic greedy-based approaches that were considered:\r\n1. Total number of unused segments\r\n2. Total size of unused segments\r\n\r\nThe problem with the above approaches is that computing and determining the heuristics can be expensive and non-trivial in the scope of the kill duty. Also, these greedy approaches won't necessarily address the fairness problem at hand in all scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Miscellaneous changes\r\nThis patch also includes a few annotation fixes and refactoring/debug logging improvements. \r\n\r\n#### Future work\r\n\r\nRefactor `RoundRobinServerSelector.CircularServerList` to use the common `CircularList` implementation.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nThe `KillUnusedSegments` coordinator duty now selects datasources in a round-robin manner during each run, ensuring varied selection instead of repeatedly choosing the same set of datasources.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nFor aggregators like StringFirst/Last, whose intermediate type isn't the same as the final type, using them in GroupBy, TopN or Timeseries subqueries causes a fallback when `maxSubqueryBytes` is set. This is because we assume that the finalization is not known, due to which the row signature cannot determine whether to use the intermediate or the final type, and it puts it as null. This PR figures out the finalization from the query context and uses the intermediate or the final type appropriately. \r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes some issues with join query virtual column resolution. The first issue fixed is that if a virtual column was referenced by a base table filter, but the inputs to the virtual column were not present in the base table, the filter would be present but the virtual column it relied on not, resulting in the filter operating on a missing column. The second similar issue is that virtual columns can now depend on other virtual columns, but the pre/post join virtual column partitioning logic had not been updated to account for this, so any virtual column that was dependent on another virtual column could incorrectly be moved to a post join virtual column since it's inputs were not fully available on the base table.\r\n\r\nTo fix these issues, we switch to simply adding all virtual columns to the base table cursor that were not explicitly detected to have inputs that are only present on the join table, where this detection is done during filter analysis. The additional logic was basically redundant since there is no harm for virtual columns on the base table with non-existent inputs being present.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nModifies the `DataSourceMSQDestination` to have a `TerminalStageSpec`. This spec tells the controller how the segments are created.  This allows queries to configure how segments are created after the queries have finished running.\r\nThis will allow queries to add new `TerminalStageSpec` which allow queries to have other results instead of generating segments. \r\n\r\nThe PR also adds a `SegmentGenerationStageSpec` to be used by default, which causes queries to create new segments with the query results.The SegmentGenerationTerminalStageSpec for ingestion is serialized as:\r\n```\r\n{\"type\":\"segmentGeneration\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR should not have a functional impact, and is meant to be used for other features in the future.\r\n\r\n**Backward Compatibility**\r\n\r\nThe changes are backward compatible. The `DataSourceMSQDestination` created has a default value which uses the `SegmentGenerationStageSpec` by default, since normally all ingestions would require a segment generation stage. If indexers/MM are upgraded first, the stage spec automatically deserializes to segment generation.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR generally improves the working of WriteOutBytes and WriteOutMedium. Some analysis of usage of TmpFileSegmentWriteOutMedium shows that they periodically get used for very small things. The overhead of creating a tmp file is actually very large. To improve the performance in these cases, this PR modifies TmpFileSegmentWriteOutMedium to return a heap-based WriteOutBytes that falls back to making a tmp file when it actually fills up.\r\n\r\n- Increases the memory in FileWriteOutBytes and switches to using direct memory to improve performance.\r\n- Refactor TmpFileSegmentWriteOutMedium to use a heap based WriteOutBytes before falling back to a temporary file.\r\n- Modify FileWriteOutBytes's behavior on writing a value larger than its buffer. Previously, it used to throw an exception. This PR modifies it to write the value to the file directly instead, bypassing the buffer.\r\n- Adds some additional logging around the usage of write out bytes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nunified the code style in NestedDataOperatorConversions\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIntroduces the concept of segmentMorphFactory to `DataSourceMSQDestination` and refactors some of the existing code around frames and semantic utils. \r\nA segmentMorphFactory is a way to introduce an alternate final stage during ingestion with MSQ. This opens up the possibility of modifying segments instead of generating new segments as a result of the query. \r\n\r\nThis PR should not have a functional impact, and is meant to be used for other features in the future.\r\n\r\nMajor changes include:\r\n- Refactor `SemanticCreator` and add `SemanticUtils`.\r\n- Add a segmentMorphFactory `FrameProcessorFactory` to MSQ.\r\n- Refactor SimpleQueryableIndex to take a metadata supplier. Refactor TmpFileSegmentWriteOutMedium to use a heap based WriteOutBytes before falling back to a temporary file.\r\n- Add FieldReader#makeRACColumn for use with row based frames.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Design\r\n\r\nThe loading rate is computed as a moving average of at least the last 10 GiB of successful segment loads.\r\n\r\nTo account for multiple loading threads on a server, we use the concept of a batch to track load times.\r\nA batch is a set of segments added by the coordinator to the load queue of a server in one go.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nbatchDurationMillis = t(load queue becomes empty) - t(first load request in batch is sent to server)\r\n\r\nbatchBytes = total bytes successfully loaded in batch\r\n\r\navg loading rate in batch (kbps) = (8 * batchBytes) / batchDurationMillis\r\n\r\noverall avg loading rate (kbps) = (8 * sumOverWindow(batchBytes)) / sumOverWindow(batchDurationMillis)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Add `LoadingRateTracker` which computes a moving average load rate based on\r\nthe last few GBs of successful segment loads.\r\n- Emit metric `segment/loading/rateKbps` from the Coordinator. In the future, we may\r\nalso consider emitting this metric from the historicals themselves.\r\n- Add `expectedLoadTimeMillis` to response of API `/druid/coordinator/v1/loadQueue?simple`\r\n\r\n### Testing done\r\n- Added new unit tests\r\n- Performed testing on local cluster with ~1M segments\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n- Emit new metric `segment/loading/rateKbps` from the Coordinator which tracks\r\nthe current segment loading rate of a server. Dimensions: `server`\r\n- Add `expectedLoadTimeMillis` to response of API `/druid/coordinator/v1/loadQueue?simple`\r\n\r\n### Future work\r\n\r\nThe `expectedLoadTimeMillis` can be used to show expected time on the web-console.\r\n\r\n__This PR does not include web-console changes and the screenshot below is only for reference.__\r\n\r\n<img width=\"944\" alt=\"load_time\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/18635897/e3f4716b-c74e-4161-bfc1-15d1835a92e2\">\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR fixes a regression caused by #16551 which modified the `UnnestStorageAdapter` to return the _output_ capabilities of the unnest column instead of the capabilities pre-unnest, which was totally cool and correct but was leaving out setting `setDictionaryValuesUnique` which is also used by unnest to check if it can use a dimension cursor.\r\n\r\nThough admittedly totally contrived, if used again in an UNNEST operator this would result in different behavior than prior to this change because the loss of `areDictionaryValuesUnique` would result in using the column value selector cursor instead of dimension selector based cursor which have different handling of null values due to the dimension cursors attempts to be compatible with the implicit unnest used by group-by and topN queries on mvds.\r\n\r\nWhile writing tests for this, I found another bug that could happen for any mvd rows with 0 size against any segment where the null value was not dictionary id 0 (such as realtime segments or segments without null values in the column). I fixed this by reporting 0 as the size of the unnested row if the underlying row is 0, which aligns behavior with the implicit unnest done by group-by and topN queries (even though they are not consistent with each other, see #5897).\r\n\r\nFinally, another bug with MSQ frames which has some mismatch where the writers are hard-coded with multi-value true while the window 'rows and columns' readers are hard-coded to use false, which results in some errors. It looks like window stuff doesn't really support multi-value strings so maybe the solution there is to just explode? But i didn't do that for now, in this case i just made the field writer detect if the input is multi-value or not so it isn't hard-coded to true (which handle 0 length rows differently than single valued)","created_at":"2024-07-04T00:59:11Z","updated_at":"2024-07-11T12:01:17Z","closed_at":"2024-07-11T12:00:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa863f8efcad3da74626628f6e85807baa0c2f9c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Motivation\r\n\r\nThe `SegmentLoadDropHandler` code currently supports the following functionalities:\r\n\r\n1. Bootstrapping on startup:\r\na. Loading previously cached segments\r\nb. Fetching and loading bootstrap segments from the coordinator\r\n2. Loading segments\r\n3. Dropping segments\r\n4. Batch operations\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from improving code hygiene, the current structure of the code makes it difficult to add new functionalities or customize the bootstrapping flow.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nThis PR proposes splitting the functionality into two separate components:\r\n1. `SegmentBootstrapper`: Responsible for bootstrapping functions\r\n2. `SegmentLoadDropHandler`: Responsible for segment change handling functions — `addSegment()`, `removeSegment()`, and `processBatch()`\r\n\r\n**Note: This patch does not introduce any new functional changes.**\r\n\r\n### Refactoring Core Changes\r\nThe majority of code in `SegmentBootstrapper` is a cut-paste from `SegmentLoadDropHandler`. To avoid regressions and simplify the review process, I refrained from making any improvements to existing functionality. The only differences are:\r\n1. Start a temporary scheduled executor in `SegmentBootstrapper` for background segment announcing and shut it down after the announcing is complete. The alternate approach was to share the executor as it was done previously, this was done in this [commit](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16685/commits/0da6cfda92bbb6871a1257fd428730c1fd396531). It doesn't matter really because the `SegmentLoadDropHandler`s executor won't take effect until segment announcing starts which happens after the modules are up.\r\n2. Rename the variable `intervalMillis` to `announceIntervalMillis` in `BackgroundSegmentAnnouncer` and add a line when background segment announcing is skipped.\r\n\r\n`SegmentBootstrapper` requires explicit `ManageLifecycle` binding to the `LifecycleModule` because it has no dependencies, aside from one Historical readiness API. Without this binding, initialization won't occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Refactoring Testing Changes\r\n- All the bootstrapping tests from `SegmentLoadDropHandlerTest` are now in `SegmentBootstrapperTest`. The non-bootstrapping tests continue to remain in `SegmentLoadDropHandlerTest`\r\n- The private inner class `SegmentLoadDropHandlerTest.TestSegmentCacheManager` is now extracted into its own class that can be shared by the tests\r\n- `SegmentLoadDropHandlerCacheTest ` is renamed to `SegmentBootstrapperCacheTest`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Check if the schema exists in the registry. Otherwise it\r\ncould mean that there is malformed data in the stream or data that doesn't conform to the schema\"\r\nspecified.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this error message is misleading in cases where the server is throwing unauthorized/forbidden error codes via `RestClientException`.  So now we handle `IOException` and `RestClientException` separately so that we can bubble up more specific errors rather than the common template.\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests for the change and also cleaned up test annotations `@Test(expected = ParseException.class)` by adding better tests assertions.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, we don't support `count (distinct complexColumn) + approximation` for unsupported types, and the query execution fails with a ClassCastException:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: class org.apache.druid.segment.nested.StructuredData cannot be cast to class org.apache.druid.hll.HyperLogLogCollector (org.apache.druid.segment.nested.StructuredData and org.apache.druid.hll.HyperLogLogCollector are in unnamed module of loader 'app')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to check if the complex column being queried aligns with the supported types in the aggregator and aggregator factories, and throws a user-friendly error message if they don't.\r\n\r\nThe validation is added in 3 layers:\r\n1. In the SQL operand type checker - This helps with the case of using APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT() and other functions.\r\n2. In the SQL layer - This helps with the case of doing `select count (distinct column)` type queries.\r\n3. In the native layer - This helps with the case of doing native queries.\r\n\r\n### Test plan\r\n\r\n1. Manually verified the functionality of `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT`, `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_DS_HLL`, `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_DS_HLL_UTF8`, `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_DS_THETA`\r\n2. Manually verified the functionality of `select count (distinct column)`\r\n3. Manually verified the functionality of native queries.\r\n\r\nSample error message after this PR's changes in sql layer:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/31135861/cf26b1ea-e611-4646-afa0-64ffb30ee4fe)\r\n\r\nSample error message after this PR's changes in native layer:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/31135861/01190c0a-01ec-440f-b4d8-6bb0cf650e53)\r\n\r\n### Release Note\r\n\r\nQueries like `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT columnName) FROM tableName WHERE columnValue = 'non-existing-value'` will also stop working with these changes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.
