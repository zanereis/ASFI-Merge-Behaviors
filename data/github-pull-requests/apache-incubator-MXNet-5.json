A new optional<T> ([#658](https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/pull/658)) structure is used to indicate that an object t may be \"moved from\" ~ allowing the efficient transfer of resources from t to another object. If an old value is moved into a new object, then the size is not enough and a blind value is reading out of the memory ~ hence:  a double corruption error shows up. The size of the stack needs to be greater to avoid double corruption errors.

Description ##\r\nFunction reshape() from modules _mxnet.numpy_ and _mxnet.numpy_extension_ will now be executed by oneDNN primitives as it is done in module _mxnet.ndarray_.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add oneDNN execution attributes to NNVM_REGISTER_OP(_npx_reshape)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nUsing two NNVM_REGISTER_OP() functions (one for _mxnet.ndarray_, second for _mxnet.numpy_/_mxnet.numpy_extension_) instead of one with .add_alias() because special values in npx.reshape's and nd.reshape's new_shape/target_shape parameters have different functionality. For example:\r\n\r\nin nd.reshape():\r\n- \"-3\" use the product of two consecutive dimensions of the input shape as the output dimension.\r\n\r\nin npx.reshape():\r\n- \"-3\" will skip current dimension if and only if the current dim size is one.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerformance comparison:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59651240/131477550-9f604e00-48d2-463e-a829-4d4d0b017381.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n- ~50% peformance speedup for mx.np.reshape() and mx.npx.reshape().\r\n- Slight loss of performance for mx.nd.reshape() is caused by adding 0-shape checks to oneDNN path (necessary for mx.np and mx.npx). It is a big deal only for small tensors.","created_at":"2021-08-31T09:36:39Z","updated_at":"2021-09-17T16:52:27Z","closed_at":"2021-09-17T16:52:27Z","merged_at":"2021-09-17T16:52:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"8832c42d2d714cafa2ceab9ebbd829c163803ee5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThe PR adds the support for fetching the gradients of intermediate variables in a gluon HybridizedBlock. This applies uniformly to both when `block.hybridize()` is on and off. This generates the `attach_grad` implemented in implemented in [PR#20500](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/20500). \r\n\r\nThe motivation of this feature comes from this [issue#11865](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11865).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] `block.py` where `mark_vars` and `get_mark_vars` are added along with `MXNDArrayMarkDCVariables`.\r\n- [x] `cached_op.invoke` in cpp backend and `CachedOp.__call__` have been editted to include the pass of marked nonleaf ndarrays.\r\n- [x] `set_nleafs` method is added into `CachedOp` class to store the marked nonleaf ndarrays.\r\n- [x] Inside `void RunGraph`, marked nonleaf ndarrays are linked to the marked computational node for autograd computation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This feature is built on top of  [PR#20500](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/20500). The modification here is mainly in the invoke of CachedOp computation.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-27T01:33:16Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T23:34:22Z","closed_at":"2022-07-06T23:34:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f1bf6959bad80d21a6d5b95d89ee095af3eb8ab0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThe PR adds the support for fetching the gradients of intermediate variables in a gluon HybridizedBlock. This applies when `block.hybridize()` is on; otherwise, calling the block would be a simpler imperative computation where the original attach_grad() can be directly applied, as implemented in [PR#20500](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/20500). \r\n\r\nThe motivation of this feature comes from this [issue#11865](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11865).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This feature is built on top of  [PR#20500](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/20500), where the modification is mainly in invoke of CachedOp computation.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-27T00:05:23Z","updated_at":"2021-08-27T01:27:23Z","closed_at":"2021-08-27T01:27:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"67ebd437ae2b13341825b8d11a183fb6eb3c9d34","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NzQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-testing","name":"pr-awaiting-testing","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nstop closing opened libs. fixes #20411 using portions already merged into master/2.0 in #19016. \r\n\r\nAccording to [[1]](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/dlclose.html) \r\n\r\n> The dlclose() function shall inform the system that the object referenced by a handle returned from a previous dlopen() invocation is no longer needed by the application.\r\n\r\n> The use of dlclose() reflects a statement of intent on the part of the process, but does not create any requirement upon the implementation, such as removal of the code or symbols referenced by handle.\r\n\r\nSo calling `dlclose` is just a suggestion to the OS that it could close the library. But the OS may not do anything (ie. and wait until the process exits to clean up any opened handles). Im thinking we might as well just let it be cleaned up anyway rather than calling `dlclose` at all. \r\n\r\nAs suggested in [[2]](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26131259)\r\n\r\n> If you only ever open one library, use it throughout your program, then calling dlclose just before you exit is probably not essential, but if you open a lot of libraries (e.g. using some sort of plugin in a long-running program that can/will use many different plugins, the program may run out of virtual address space if you don't call dlclose.\r\n\r\n> (All shared libraries are closed on exit anyway, so leaving it open at exit should not be an issue)\r\n\r\nSo if a user was loading/unloading a bunch of libraries at runtime they might want to close some they dont need anymore. \r\n\r\nHowever, since MXNet registers components from the library (ie. operators, partitioners, graph passes, etc) and has NO capability to unregister them the references to the loaded library will live at least as long as MXNet (ie. libmxnet.so) does. MXNet already has quite a few components (or its dependencies like TVM/NNVM) that live forever and require the OS to clean them up when the process exits. So its not possible to close libmxnet.so and assume everything is cleaned up. We might as well do the same thing for custom libraries. \r\n\r\nThis PR removes the code to close opened libraries in the destructor of the `LibraryInitializer` class with the caveat that MXNet will still have pointers to that library, so closing would not be recommended until process exit anyway.","created_at":"2021-08-12T23:34:36Z","updated_at":"2021-08-18T21:28:17Z","closed_at":"2021-08-18T21:28:17Z","merged_at":"2021-08-18T21:28:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"b5e9ae89bb5a4232875cd354ffe9a091b43bba69","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nThe PR adds the support for fetching the gradients of intermediate variables in a computation graph.\r\n\r\nThe motivation of this feature comes from this [issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11865). \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] `Imperative::MarkVariables` in `src/imperative/imperative.cc` to include the case of marking nonleaf nodes\r\n- [x] `Imperative::Backward` in `src/imperative/imperative.cc` to retrieve nonleaf nodes and link `node->info.out_grads[]` to buffered arrays.\r\n- [x] `Graph BuildGradientGraph` to map forward node to the corresponding gradient node entry.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here: 1. the gradient-queried node is the output node, `z.retain_grad()`. 2. when it is used combined with detaching computation. \r\n- Note that `u.retain_grad()` is called outside the scope of ag.record(). Otherwise, `u.retain_grad()` would be recorded as operation and trigger building of computational node. This is conceptually not desired.","created_at":"2021-08-09T00:26:23Z","updated_at":"2021-09-23T21:41:08Z","closed_at":"2021-09-23T21:41:08Z","merged_at":"2021-09-23T21:41:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"05d1b26520d0dcaf3bf9d55343b9792eccb63a6f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

TensorRT support in C++ API. Updated unit tests / examples.\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\nTensorRT support is broken in C++ API. (fixes #19550, fixes #20307). This PR adds support for OptimizeForBackend which mirrors the modern Python approach (http://mxnet.apache.org/versions/1.8.0/api/python/docs/tutorials/performance/backend/tensorrt/tensorrt.html))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Add mxnet::cpp::Symbol::OptimizeForBackend \r\n- Option to pass flags to mxnet::cpp::Executor (needed to pass static_alloc and static_shape needed for TensorRT)\r\n- Update example/inference/imagenet_inference.cpp to reflect the new way of using TensorRT

[BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Remove cuda_driver library linking for libmxnet. \r\n- [x] Correct current LibraryInitializer::get_sym API. const char* is used instead of char* for the name parameter.\r\n- [x] Correct current get_func API accordingly with const char* instead of char* for the name parameter. \r\n- [x] Call get_sym for all functions from libcuda (functions starting with cu) to dynamically load the symbol and convert them to corresponding function pointers for the src/common/cuda/rtc.cc file. \r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nAs stated in array [api standaization](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/API_specification/data_types.html), array api should support bool, int8, int16, int32, int64, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, float32, float64 data types. \r\n\r\nThis PR will extend MXNet NumPy array data type with int16, uint16, uint32, uint64, which are not supported in current design. Also, the following array creation functions will also update these data type support: \r\n`mx.np.arange`, `mx.np.empty`, `mx.np.empty_like`, `mx.np.eye`, `mx.np.full`, `mx.np.full_like`, `mx.np.ones`, `mx.np.ones_like`\r\nType cast function:\r\n`arr.astype()`\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add dtypes: int16, uint16, uint32, uint64\r\n- [x] Update array creation functions\r\n- [x] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Update manipulation functions and operators. \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

2021.3 fixed linking OpenMP while using SDL and MKL_THREADING_LAYER set to GNU.\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\nOneMKL 2021.3 fixes the issue described [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/18255#issuecomment-817830091). Thus, it enables linking with MKL dynamic libraries without having multiple OneMPs in a single process. It is possible due to linking MxNET with oneMKL Single Dynamic Library (SDL) and then setting the appropriate threading layer at run time in a function mkl_threading_layer() (or through environment variable MKL_THREADING_LAYER).\r\n\r\nConnected with: [#19610], [#18255] and [#17794].\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\t\r\n\r\n1. Add oneMKL 2021.3 to ubuntu docker images.\r\n2. Enable MKL SDL (MKL_USE_SINGLE_DYNAMIC_LIBRARY) as the default linking when MKL version is grower than 2021.2 and static linking is turned off. (Bug no: MKLD-11109, [OneMKL release notes](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-oneapi-math-kernel-library-onemkl-bug-fixes.html)) .\r\n4. Otherwise, MKL static libraries are taken into account and used to build MxNET library.\r\n5.

Description ##\r\nThis PR introduces Gluon blocks enabling spatial parallel convolutions (convolutions spanning multiple GPUs). This functionality was used in the NVIDIA's UNet-3D submission for MLPerf 1.0.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] SpatialParallelConv2D module\r\n- [x] SpatialParallelConv3D module\r\n- [x] SpatialParallelSplit module\r\n- [x] SpatialParallelAllgather module \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Currently the code has multiple restrictions: supports only the channels last format (NHWC and NDHWC) and requires that the filter/padding in first spatial dimension (D in 3D case, H in 2D case) fulfill `pad = (filter - 1)/2` equation (so e.g. for filter size 3, pad has to be 1).\r\n- In order to bootstrap NCCL communicator I use out of band MPI communication via mpi4py, which is why I submit it to contrib

Description ##\r\nThis PR makes RTC (as invoked by our Python unittests and other model scripts) work with CUDA enhanced compatibility. \r\n As such, it is an extension of PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/19364, which brought that functionality to the C++ backend.  This PR keeps test_operator_gpu.py::test_cuda_rtc from failing on systems that rely on CUDA enhanced compatibility, though those systems may not be part of upstream CI at present.\r\n \r\nThe changes of this PR are:\r\n- break off the calculation of the max supported arch into a separate function GetMaxSupportedArch(), and enhance it to use nvrtcGetSupportedArchs() if CUDA_VERSION >= 11.2\r\n- wrap GetMaxSupportedArch() as MXGetMaxSupportedArch() and add it to the C api\r\n- use MXGetMaxSupportedArch() in a newly created Python utility function get_rtc_compile_opts(ctx)\r\n- enhance test_cuda_rtc to use this new function\r\n\r\nOur current approach to RTC in Python code, which might fail under CUDA enhanced compatibility:\r\n```\r\nmodule = mx.rtc.CudaModule(source)\r\n```\r\nWith this PR, the new approach that succeeds under CUDA enhanced compatibility:\r\n```\r\nctx = < some GPU context, e.g. mx.gpu(0) >\r\nmodule = mx.rtc.CudaModule(source, options=get_rtc_compile_opts(ctx))\r\n```\r\nget_rtc_compile_opts() will return a list of options that is most appropriate for the system and the gpu context.  Currently this is a single option of the form `--gpu-architecture=compute_NN` or `--gpu-architecture=sm_NN` as needed.\r\n## Background ##\r\nStarting with CUDA 11.1, a user can accept minor release upgrades of the CUDA toolkit (potentially picking up support for a newer GPU arch) without upgrading the driver (per https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html).  In such cases, the toolkit nvrtc compile toolchain should not only compile CUDA code to PTX, but also further translate the PTX to SASS, since the driver would be unable to JIT-compile to SASS for the newer GPU arch.  This is controlled by the nvrtc compiler option used: for example, to compile to SASS for the Ampere A100 the option is `--gpu-architecture=sm_80`.  To compile only to PTX, and so rely on the driver's ability to JIT-compile to SASS, the option is `--gpu-architecture=compute_80`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [~] All changes have test coverage [Verified privately, but ideally upstream's CI would have systems that stress this PR]\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-12T02:52:26Z","updated_at":"2021-07-13T23:21:44Z","closed_at":"2021-07-13T23:21:44Z","merged_at":"2021-07-13T23:21:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"8fd17cef2ee854239c6e66f2dd3b9467aa222f79","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

This pull request contains a pre-commit git hook, a git-pre-commit file, (Related to: #20406, #20356 #20429)\r\n\r\nSince clang-format needs to be installed with an appropriate configuration, the file with the requirements has to be run:\r\nAfter that, we need to set up a symbolic link to a given file: To create a symbolic link to a given file, open your terminal and type:\r\n```\r\nln -s ../../tools/git-pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have not set up the pre-commit hooks, you can run it locally in your local branch.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials

Description ##\r\nFor people who use conda create python env, install `cudatoolkit` is the most efficient way to get Cuda support.\r\nHowever, the package will not implement the system variables. Then mxnet will not find the corresponding cuda dlls.\r\nBy adding `$CONDA_PREFIX/Library/bin` can solve this problem.\r\nfor the people who always working in jupyter, adding \"CUDA_PREFIX\" to env of jupyter kernelspec file will be necessary.\r\n\r\nBTW, I still write an other more brute way:\r\n```python\r\nimport pathlib\r\n\r\n_ = list(\r\n    map(\r\n        lambda x: os.add_dll_directory(str(x)),\r\n        (p for p in map(pathlib.Path, set(map(str.lower, os.environ['path'].split(';')))) if next(p.glob('*.dll'), None) is not None),\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThis way add all the dir has dll in `$PATH` to dll search path. But, I not sure too long dll dir path will harm to some performance. By the slice test on my machine. It has a tiny influence to the import modules.\r\n\r\nI'm a beginner of mxnet that just finish the installation, Sorry for the inconvenience this PR may bring to you.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n###

This pull request contains a pre-commit git hook, a requirement file, .flake8 file with a flake8 configuration. (Related to: #20406, #20356)\r\n\r\n1. Since Flake8 needs to be installed with an appropriate configuration, the file with the requirements has to be run: \r\n```\r\npip install -r requirements-flake8.txt\r\n```\r\n2. After that, we need to set up a symbolic link to a given file: To create a symbolic link to a given file, open your terminal and type:\r\n```\r\nln -s ../../tools/git-pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit\r\n```\r\n3. If you have not set up the pre-commit hooks, you can run it locally in your local branch.\r\n\r\n## Future consideration ##\r\n1. Flake8 tool should be run also on a CI. \r\n2. *.py files need to be adjusted firstly. Flake8 check the entire file. \r\n3. Add a pre-commit configuration: [pre-commit manager] \r\n   3.1: Create a file named `.pre-commit -config.yaml`.\r\n   3.2: Set up the full set of options for a given file. \r\n\r\n## Checklist
