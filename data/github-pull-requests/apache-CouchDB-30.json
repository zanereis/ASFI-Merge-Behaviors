The cause for this is that instead of\r\nwriting single element nodes it would instead prefer to write kv nodes\r\nwith three elements. While normally we might prefer this in memory, it\r\nturns out that our append only storage this causes a significantly more\r\namount of trash on disk.\r\n\r\nWe can show this with a few trivial examples. Imagine we write KV's a\r\nthrough f. The two following patterns show the nodes as we write each\r\nnew kv.\r\n\r\n    Before 3298:\r\n\r\n    []\r\n    [a]\r\n    [a, b]\r\n    [a, b]', [c]\r\n    [a, b]', [c, d]\r\n    [a, b]', [c, d]', [e]\r\n    [a, b]', [c, d]', [e, f]\r\n\r\n    After 3298:\r\n\r\n    []\r\n    [a]\r\n    [a, b]\r\n    [a, b, c]\r\n    [a, b]', [c, d]\r\n    [a, b]', [c, d, e]\r\n    [a, b]', [c, d]', [e, f]\r\n\r\nThe thing to realize here is which of these nodes end up as garbage. In\r\nthe first example we end up with [a], [a, b], [c], [c, d], and [e] nodes\r\nthat have been orphaned. Where as in the second case we end up with\r\n[a], [a, b], [a, b, c], [c, d], [c, d, e] as nodes that have been\r\norphaned. A quick aside, the reason that [a, b] and [c, d] are orphaned\r\nis due to how a btree update works. For instance, when adding c, we read\r\n[a, b] into memory, append c, and then during our node write we call\r\nchunkify which gives us back [a, b], [c] which leads us to writing [a,\r\nb] a second time.\r\n\r\nThis patch changes the write function to realize when we're merely\r\nappending KVs and saves us this extra write and generation of garbage.\r\nIts node patterns look like such:\r\n\r\n    []\r\n    [a]\r\n    [a, b]\r\n    [a, b], [c]\r\n    [a, b], [c, d]\r\n    [a, b], [c, d], [e]\r\n    [a, b], [c, d], [e, f]\r\n\r\nWhich means we only end up generating [a], [c], and [e] as garbage (with\r\nrespect to kv nodes, kp nodes retain their historical behavior).\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nNormal `make check`\r\n\r\n## JIRA issue number\r\n\r\nThis is related to COUCHDB-3298 and is a follow on work\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

Overview\r\n\r\nPluggable Storage Engines (Oh my!)\r\n\r\nI've finally covered enough bases to start asking for reviews on the pluggable storage engine work. I know that this is a fairly large change so I don't expect this to actually be merged for a number of weeks. So everyone that wants to review any part of this feel free to take your time and be thorough.\r\n\r\nI highly suggest reviewing this work a commit at a time as there are a few fairly large commits. A few signposts for the intrepid reader:\r\n\r\n1. Add couch_db_engine module\r\n\r\nThis is a single file addition that just introduces the new pluggable storage engine API. Its fairly thoroughly documented and hopefully makes sense as to the level that this API is geared at. When I initially started this work I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what level of the API would be the best place to separate the storage engine from database logic. Go too high and every engine is reimplementing core bits of logic. Go to low and there's not enough room for interesting changes to the actual storage engine algorithms. I believe this is a happy middle ground that gives storage engines the room to play and invent alternative implementations while also not requiring an extremely large amount of reimplementation for various bits of behavior that are required.\r\n\r\n2. Add legacy storage engine implementation\r\n\r\nThis commit is quite big but its important to note that all its doing is copying the existing parts of couch_db.erl and couch_db_updater.erl and moving them to a new set of modules named couch_bt_engine_*.erl. Nothing uses this code yet. I have this in its own commit since its fairly large. However, if you mostly just want to check it you should be able to see that the implementation is just pulled from existing functions. The behavior of this engine is identical to the \"pre-PSE\" engine because that's what it is. Its just been reformatted a bit and had its name changed.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've kept this and couch_db_engine.erl in the main couch application since we'll always want to have at least one storage engine. Though this was pre-monorepo when adding another git repo to our builds seemed awfully heavy. Now that we're monorepo we're just creating a folder which is easy enough. For any reviewer I'd like to have them keep this in mind as one thing I expect to discuss is whether we should split this out into its own application.\r\n\r\n3. Implement pluggable storage engines\r\n\r\nThis is the doozy. There are two main bits of work going on in this commit. First, the removal of all the code that was in the previous commit and second, the addition of all the code to have couch_db and couch_db_updater start using the couch_db_engine APIs. Its long and big but really if you take your time there's nothing magical going on here. For the core bits to study I'd recommend spending some extra time on couch_server to see how engines are configured and chosen at runtime.\r\n\r\n4. Add storage engine test suite\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly complete test suite for the entire storage engine API. I don't remember what coverage of couch_bt_engine was but I know its fairly high. The useful bit about this is when devs are creating new storage engines they can just pull this in with a single eunit case to test their implementations. I'll show a few examples on this below.\r\n\r\n5. Ensure deterministic revisions for attachments\r\n\r\nI may end up squashing this into the implementation commit. This was a fix while I was developing PSE that I ended up refixing after the fact slightly differently. The original goal was to make sure everything compiled and all tests suites ran for each commit. I think I've just convinced myself to squash this. So if its missing its because I did that and then forgot to edit this description to remove this paragraph...\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n$ make check\r\n\r\n## JIRA issue number\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-3287\r\n\r\n## Related Pull Requests\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on the previous mixed cluster upgrade PR. However when merge time comes around we'll merge #495 first and then this will be merged into master so that users can deploy the first changes before these changes.

Overview\r\n\r\nThis is preparatory work for adding pluggable storage engines. The motivation for this ground work is to enable users to perform rolling reboots of clusters. As such there are a few things that need to change to make that happen.\r\n\r\n1. Remove the public definition of `#db{}`\r\n2. Add a new fabric_rpc:create_db/2 that accepts an options list\r\n3. Create a template of the new `#db{}` for forwards compatibility\r\n\r\nThe removal of the `#db{}` definition is what's responsible for 99% of these changes. And while there is a decent amount of code churn here its nearly all quite straightforward changes from `Db#db.name` to `couch_db:name(Db)` type changes so theoretically this should be a pretty quick review.\r\n\r\nThe only somewhat difficult bits are when we were matching a `#db{}` record in a function head. For the most part this was just to extract fields from the record so those are easily reviewed. Though there are a few cases in the replicator that were using it to tell the different between `#db{}` and `#httpd{}`. For those we have to switch the order of clauses to pull out the `#httpd{}` logic first.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThere's no behavior changes so the existing test suite covers the existing logic.\r\n\r\n## JIRA issue number\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-3288\r\n\r\n## Related Pull Requests\r\n\r\nI'm going to open a PR for COUCHDB-3287 which is the main PSE work that will be asking to merge into this PR. This is purely for the sake of review-ability. When we go to merge these we'll merge this PR first, and then merge 3287 into master. I expect the review of this work to take at least a couple weeks since it is quite a large change to the core bit of the database.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works

In addition, two additional test cases `should_return_409_for_del_att_without_rev` and `should_return_200_for_del_att_with_rev` are introduced to make sure that there is no regression.\r\n```\r\n======================== EUnit ========================\r\nchttpd db tests\r\n  chttpd_db_test:71: should_return_ok_true_on_bulk_update...[0.107 s] ok\r\n  chttpd_db_test:86:

is bringing back previous code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/884cf3e55f77ab1a5f26dc7202ce21771062eae6/src/couch_replicator_manager.erl#L940-L946\r\n\r\nThe rationale is the following: during shard scanning a lot of `resume_scan`\r\nmessages are sent back to back. This causes the replicator manager to open\r\nchange feeds for all of those shards. By delaying `resume_scan` message by\r\na jitter proportional to the number messages sent to far, it gives replicator\r\nmanager a chance to open some change feeds, finish processing them and

commit adds a new Python-based database migration tool, `couchup`.\r\nIt is intended to be used at the command-line on the server being\r\nupgraded, before bringing the node (or cluster) into service.\r\n\r\n`couchup` provides 4 sub-commands to assist in the migration process:\r\n\r\n* `list` - lists all CouchDB 1.x databases\r\n* `replicate` - replicates one or more 1.x databases to CouchDB 2.x\r\n* `rebuild` - rebuilds one or more CouchDB 2.x views\r\n* `delete` - deletes one or more CouchDB 1.x databases\r\n\r\nA typical workflow for a single-node upgrade process would look like:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ couchup list\r\n$ couchup replicate -a\r\n$ couchup rebuild -a\r\n$ couchup delete -a\r\n```\r\n\r\nA clustered upgrade process would be the same, but must be preceded by\r\nsetting up all the nodes in the cluster first.\r\n\r\nVarious optional arguments provide for admin login/password, overriding\r\nports, quiet mode and so on.\r\n\r\nOf special note is that `couchup rebuild` supports an optional flag,\r\n`-f`, to filter deleted documents during the replication process.\r\n\r\nI struggled some with the naming convention. For those in the know, a\r\n'1.x database' is a node-local database appearing only on port 5986, and\r\na '2.x database' is a clustered database appearing on port 5984, and in\r\nraw, sharded form on port 5986.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1. Copy a bunch of CouchDB 1.x `.couch` files into the CouchDB 2.x `data/` directory.\r\n2. Start CouchDB 2.x.\r\n3. Use the 4 `couchup` commands to list, replicate, rebuild and delete the databases as desired.\r\n4. Test your application against the migrated data.\r\n5.

couch_auth_cache process was attempting to track its various\r\nmonitors and then based on its monitor history decide if a 'DOWN'\r\nmessage meant it should reinitialize or exit. With the new pluggable\r\nstorage engine work there was a subtle change to monitors which ended up\r\ncausing couch_auth_cache to receive a monitor from the file descriptor\r\nbefore it received the monitor from the database's main pid. This\r\nreordering was enough for couch_auth_cache to exit which ended up\r\ncausing errors in the test suite with race conditions when the test\r\ntried to open an auth db before couch_auth_cache had restarted and\r\ncreated the database.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we step back and think harder, we'll never get a monitor\r\nmessage we didn't ask for so rather than attempt to track specific\r\nmonitors we just reinitialize the cache everytime we see a 'DOWN'\r\nmessage. On the downside this means that we're clearing the cache\r\nmultiple times per database exit, however normal operations won't have\r\nthis issue since that database never changes and clearing the cache\r\ntwice in the test suite is a non issue.\r\n\r\nCOUCHDB-3379\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-18T19:03:29Z","updated_at":"2017-04-18T19:51:56Z","closed_at":"2017-04-18T19:44:15Z","merged_at":"2017-04-18T19:44:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f0f806e903ac334a768210a9ac4a3c7947956c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/481/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/481/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/481/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/d754c8c7f7d43e6d526f800d329704e906f793f0","head":{"label":"apache:COUCHDB-3379-fix-couch-auth-cache-reinit","ref":"COUCHDB-3379-fix-couch-auth-cache-reinit","sha":"d754c8c7f7d43e6d526f800d329704e906f793f0","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n     \r\n     Please file this form by replacing markdown commentary\r\n     tags with the text. If section needs in no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model \r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback provides by +1 from committers\r\n     while negative by -1. The -1 also means veto and need to be addressed\r\n     to find the consensus. Once there are no objections, PR could be merged.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR changes how CouchDB manages view indexes. Specifically, it 1) adds an LRU cache to couch_index_server for view groups 2) causes idle view groups to close if more than a configurable soft maximum number of indexes are open and 3) adds additional bookkeeping for couch_index_server to track if a view index is eligible for closing. The PR also has a few other changes in CouchDB for bits of code which assume view groups are never closed.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThis is primarily a performance improvement and shouldn't affect the API. This PR includes eunit tests, which can be run with `make check`.\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users \r\n     could notice?

Overview\r\n\r\nThere were two issues with mem3_shards that were fixed while I've been testing the PSE code.\r\nThe first issue was found by Jay Doane where a database can have its shards inserted into the cache after its been deleted. This can happen if a client does a rapid CREATE/DELETE/GET cycle on a database. The fix for this is to track the changes feed update sequence from the changes feed listener and only insert shard maps that come from a client that has read as recent of an update_seq as mem3_shards.\r\n\r\nThe second issue found during heavy benchmarking was that large shard maps (in the Q>=128 range) can quite easily cause mem3_shards to backup when there's a thundering herd attempting to open the database. There's no coordination among workers trying to add a shard map to the cache so if a bunch of independent clients all send the shard map at once (say, at the beginning of a benchmark) then mem3_shards can get overwhelmed. The fix for this was two fold. First, rather than send the shard map directly to mem3_shards, we copy it into a spawned process and when/if mem3_shards wants to write it, it tells this writer process to do its business. The second optimization for this change is to create an ets table to track these processes. Then independent clients can check if a shard map is already enroute to mem3_shards by using ets:insert_new and canceling their writer if that returns false.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nAssuming you have the stack available you should be able to duplicate the test results fairly easily by creating a Q=256 database and then having 200 or so HTTP workers write random docs to it as fast as possible. The trick to triggering this is to make sure that all 200 workers start at once though.\r\n\r\n## JIRA issue number\r\n\r\nCOUCHDB-3376\r\n\r\n## Related Pull Requests\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n\r\nNo documentation change since its not covering a public facing API or behavior other than \"stuff don't break now\".\r\n\r\nFor tests, there's nothing added or removed for these. Its implicitly tested by any test that does clustered operations on a database but there's no existing test suite specifically for the caching

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a one-line admin security check to the db/_compact and db/_view_cleanup endpoints, which are currently missing. This implements only server level admin checks according to this blog: http://blog.mattwoodward.com/2012/03/definitive-guide-to-couchdb.html\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\nCurrently all members of a database can trigger db compaction by sending a POST request to /db/_compact. This should be reserved to admins. Test by sending a POST request as a db member before and after applying this patch.\r\n\r\n## JIRA issue

It also ensures `couch_mrview_compactor:remove_compacted/1` is called.\r\n\r\n## COUCHDB-3364\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n     \r\n     Please file this form by replacing markdown commentary\r\n     tags with the text. If section needs in no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model \r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback provides by +1 from committers\r\n     while negative by -1. The -1 also means veto and need to be addressed\r\n     to find the consensus. Once there are no objections, PR could be merged.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nWhen indexing a set of fields for text search, we also create a special\r\nfield called $fieldnames. It contains values for all the fields that\r\nneed to be indexed. In order to do that, we need a unique list of the\r\nform [[<<\"$fieldnames\">>, Name, []] | Rest]. The old code would add an\r\nelement to the list, and then check for membership via lists:member/2.\r\nThis is inefficient. Some documents can contain a large number of\r\nfields, so we will use gb_sets to create a unique set of fields, and\r\nthen extract out the field names.\r\n\r\nAn alternative is to just use lists:usort/1. For small sets, it would be more efficient,\r\nbut if a document is large enough thousands of fields, gb_sets seems to perform\r\nmore. The tradeoff is that while gb_set could take longer overall for indexing,\r\nit could reduce the probability of timing out when datasets are extremely large.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\nThere are no usability changes for the user as this is a performance enhancement. A full regression should be sufficient. It requires https://github.com/cloudant-labs/dreyfus to be installed.\r\n \r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users \r\n     could

Scheduling CouchDB Replicator\r\n\r\nJira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-3324\r\n\r\nThe core of the new replicator is a scheduler. It which allows running a large number of replication jobs by switching between them, stopping some and starting others periodically. Jobs which fail are backed off exponentially. There is also an improved inspection and querying API: `_scheduler/jobs` and `_scheduler/docs`.\r\n\r\nReplication protocol hasn't change so it is possible to replicate between CouchDB 1.x, 2.x, PouchDB, and other implementations of CouchDB replication protocol.\r\n\r\n## Scheduler\r\n\r\nScheduler allows running a large number of replication jobs. Tested with up to 100k replication jobs in 3 node cluster. Replication jobs are run in a fair, round-robin fashion. Scheduler behavior can be configured by these configuration options in `[replicator]` sections:\r\n\r\n   * `max_jobs` : Number of actively running replications. Making this too high\r\n     could cause performance issues. Making it too low could mean replications jobs\r\n     might not have enough time to make progress before getting unscheduled again.\r\n     This parameter can be adjusted at runtime and will take effect during next\r\n     rescheduling cycle.\r\n\r\n   * `interval` : Scheduling interval in milliseconds. During each reschedule\r\n       cycle scheduler might start or stop up to \"max_churn\" number of jobs.\r\n\r\n   * `max_churn` : Maximum number of replications to start and stop during\r\n      rescheduling. This parameter along with \"interval\" defines the rate of job\r\n      replacement. During startup, however a much larger number of jobs could be\r\n      started (up to max_jobs) in a short period of time.\r\n\r\n## _scheduler/{jobs,docs} API\r\n\r\nThere is an improved replication state querying API, with a focus on ease of use and performance. The new API avoids having to update the replication document with transient state updates. In production that can lead to conflicts and performance issues. The two new APIs are:\r\n\r\n   * `_scheduler/jobs` : This endpoint shows active replication jobs. These are jobs managed by the scheduler. Some of them might be running, some might be waiting to run, or backed off (penalized) because they crashed too many times. Semantically this is somewhat equivalent to `_active_tasks` but focuses only on replications. Jobs which have completed or which were never created because of malformed replication document will not be shown here as they are not managed by the scheduler. \r\n\r\n   *  `_scheduler/docs` :  This endpoint is an improvement on having to go back and re-read replication document to query their state. It represents the state of all the replications started from documents in `_replicator` dbs. Unlike `_scheduler/jobs` it will also show jobs which have failed or completed (that is, which are not managed by the scheduler anymore). \r\n\r\n## Compatibility Mode\r\n\r\nUnderstandably some customers are using the document-based API to query replication states (`triggered`, `error`, `completed` etc). To ease the upgrade path, there is a compatibility configuration setting:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[replicator]\r\nupdate_docs = false | true\r\n```\r\nIt defaults to `false` but when set to `true` it will continue updating replication document with the state of the replication jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Improvements\r\n\r\n * Network resource usage and performance was improved by implementing a common connection pool. This should help in cases of a large number of connections to the same sources or target. Previously connection pools were shared only withing a single replication job.\r\n\r\n * Improved rate limiting handling. Replicator requests will auto-discover rate limit capacity on targets and sources based on a proven Additive Increase / Multiplicative Decrease feedback control algorithm.\r\n\r\n * Improved performance by avoiding repeatedly retrying failing replication jobs. Instead use exponential backoff. In a large multi-user cluster, quite a few replication jobs are invalid, are crashing or failing (for various reasons such as inability to checkpoint to source, mismatched credentials, missing databases). Penalizing failing replication will free up system resources for more useful work. \r\n\r\n * Improved recovery from long but temporary network failure. Currently if replications jobs fail to start 10 times in a row, they will not be retried anymore. This is sometimes desirable, but in some scenarios (for example, after a sustained DNS failure which eventually recovers), replications reach their retry limit and cease to work. Previously it required operator intervention to continue. Scheduling replicator will never give up retrying a valid scheduled replication job. So it should recover automatically.\r\n\r\n * Better handling of filtered replications: Failing to fetch filters could block couch replicator manager, lead to message queue backups and memory exhaustion. Also, when replication filter code changes update replication accordingly (replication job ID should change in that case). This PR fixes both of those issues. Filters and replication ID calculation are managed in separate worker threads (in couch replicator doc processor). Also, when filter code changes on the source, replication jobs will restart and re-calculate their new ID automatically.\r\n\r\n## Related PR:\r\n\r\nDocumentation PR:  https://github.com/apache/couchdb-documentation/pull/123\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\n* EUnit test coverage. Some modules such as multidb_changes, have close to 100% coverage. Some have less. All previous replication tests have been updated to work with the new scheduling replicator. \r\n\r\n* Except for one modification, existing Javascript tests pass.\r\n\r\n* Additional integration tests. To validate, test and benchmark some edge cases, an additional toolkit was created: https://github.com/cloudant-labs/couchdyno/blob/master/README_tests.md which allows testing scenarios where nodes fail, creation of large number of replication jobs, manipulation of cluster configurations, and setting up long running (soak) tests.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-04T23:07:07Z","updated_at":"2019-02-05T16:28:06Z","closed_at":"2017-04-28T21:48:59Z","merged_at":"2017-04-28T21:48:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"f7a711d697cd4d9978873bb1846af114458202be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/470/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/470/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/470/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/6df8cf62e411f525573b1e39db68f80ef6507f6b","head":{"label":"apache:63012-scheduler","ref":"63012-scheduler","sha":"6df8cf62e411f525573b1e39db68f80ef6507f6b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless
