for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, pure SQL users are short of ways to see the Hadoop configurations which may affect their jobs a lot, they are only able to get the Hadoop configs that exist in `SQLConf` while other defaults in `SharedState.hadoopConf` display wrongly and confusingly with `<undefined>`.\r\n\r\nThe pre-loaded ones from `core-site.xml, hive-site.xml` etc., will only stay in `sparkSession.sharedState.hadoopConf` or `sc._hadoopConfiguation` not `SQLConf`. Some of them that related the Hive Metastore connection(never change it spark runtime), e.g. `hive.metastore.uris`, are clearly global static and unchangeable but displayable I guess. Some of the ones that might be related to, for example, the output codec/compression, preset in Hadoop/hive config files like core-site.xml shall be still changeable from case to case, table to table, file to file, etc. It' meaningfully to show the defaults for users to change based on that.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I propose to support get a Hadoop configuration by SET syntax, for example\r\n```\r\nSET mapreduce.map.output.compress.codec;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nbetter user experience for pure SQL users\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes, where retrieving a conf only existing in sessionState.hadoopConf, before is `undefined` and now you see it\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is the shuffle fetch side change where executors can fetch local/remote push-merged shuffle data from shuffle services. This is needed for push-based shuffle - SPIP [SPARK-30602](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30602).\r\nThe change adds support to the `ShuffleBlockFetchIterator` to fetch push-merged block meta and shuffle chunks from local and remote ESS. If the fetch of any of these fails, then the iterator fallsback to fetch the original shuffle blocks that belonged to the push-merged block.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese changes are needed for push-based shuffle. Refer to the SPIP in [SPARK-30602](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30602).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nWhen push-based shuffle is turned on then that will fetch push-merged blocks from the remote shuffle service. The client logs will indicate this.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\nThe reference PR with the consolidated changes covering the complete implementation is also provided in [SPARK-30602](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30602).\r\nWe have already verified the functionality and the improved performance as documented in the SPIP doc.\r\n\r\nLead-authored-by:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to add a plugin API for providing scheduling suggestion to Spark task scheduler.\r\n\r\nDesign doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wfEaAZA7t02P6uBH4F3NGuH_qjK5e4X05v1E5pWNhlQ/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSpark scheduler schedules tasks to executors in an arbitrary (maybe not accurate description, but I cannot find good term here) way. The schedule schedules the tasks by itself. Although there is locality configuration, the configuration is used for data locality purposes. Generally we cannot suggest the scheduler where a task should be scheduled to. Normally it is not a problem because the general task is executor-agnostic.\r\n\r\nBut for special tasks, for example stateful tasks in Structured Streaming, state store is maintained at the executor side. Changing task location means reloading checkpoint data from the last batch. It has disadvantages from the performance perspective and also casts some limitations when we want to implement some features in Structured Streaming. We need an API to tell Spark scheduler how to schedule tasks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo. This API should be developer-only and currently for Spark internal only too.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR contains:\r\n- AnalysisHelper changes to allow the resolve function family to stop earlier without traversing the entire tree;\r\n- Example changes in a few rules to support such pruning, e.g., ResolveRandomSeed, ResolveWindowFrame, ResolveWindowOrder, and ResolveNaturalAndUsingJoin.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt's a framework-level change for reducing the query compilation time.\r\nIn particular, if we update existing analysis rules' call sites as per the examples in this PR, the analysis time can be reduced as described in the [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SEUhkbo8X-0cYAJFYFDQhxUnKJBz4lLn3u4xR2qfWqk).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Extend SQL syntax rules to support a sign before the interval strings of ANSI year-month and day-time intervals.\r\n2. Recognize `-` in `AstBuilder` and negate parsed intervals.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo conform to the SQL standard which allows a sign before the string interval, see `\"5.3 <literal>\"`:\r\n```\r\n<interval literal> ::=\r\n  INTERVAL [ <sign> ] <interval string> <interval qualifier>\r\n<interval string> ::=\r\n  <quote> <unquoted interval string> <quote>\r\n<unquoted interval string> ::=\r\n  [ <sign> ] { <year-month literal> | <day-time literal> }\r\n<sign> ::=\r\n    <plus sign>\r\n  | <minus sign>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nShould not because it just extends supported intervals syntax.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new tests in `interval.sql`:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z interval.sql\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-04-12T20:17:47Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T05:55:11Z","closed_at":"2021-04-13T05:55:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"50db52f5dedf721e6f64b901702158d1a8245b75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32134/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32134/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32134/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9b44a38af03673387c8d0537ac0ab7ab6b159e44","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:negative-parsed-intervals","ref":"negative-parsed-intervals","sha":"9b44a38af03673387c8d0537ac0ab7ab6b159e44","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nNow that we merged the Koalas main code into the PySpark code base (#32036), we should port the Koalas operations on different frames unit tests to PySpark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, the pandas-on-Spark modules are not tested fully. We should enable the operations on different frames unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nEnable operations on

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31708 . For full outer join, the final result RDD is created from\r\n```\r\nsparkContext.union(\r\n  matchedStreamRows,\r\n  sparkContext.makeRDD(notMatchedBroadcastRows)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's incorrect to say that the final output partitioning is `UnknownPartitioning(left.outputPartitioning.numPartitions)`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix a correctness bug\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, see the added test. Fortunately, this bug is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nDisallow group by aliases under ANSI mode.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs per the ANSI SQL standard secion 7.12 <group by clause>:\r\n\r\n>Each `grouping column reference` shall unambiguously reference a column of the table resulting from the `from clause`. A column referenced in a `group by clause` is a grouping column.\r\n\r\nBy forbidding it, we can avoid ambiguous SQL queries like:\r\n```\r\nSELECT col + 1 as col FROM t GROUP BY col\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, group by aliases is not allowed under ANSI mode.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Map Catalyst's interval types to Hive's types:\r\n    - YearMonthIntervalType -> `interval_year_month`\r\n    - DayTimeIntervalType -> `interval_day_time`\r\n2. Invoke `HiveResult.toHiveString()` to convert external intervals types ` java.time.Period`/`java.time.Duration` to strings.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To be able to retrieve ANSI intervals via Hive Thrift server.\r\n2. This fixes the issue:\r\n```sql\r\n $ ./sbin/start-thriftserver.sh\r\n $ ./bin/beeline\r\nBeeline version 2.3.8 by Apache Hive\r\nbeeline> !connect jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/default \"\" \"\" \"\"\r\nConnecting to jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/default\r\nConnected to: Spark SQL (version 3.2.0-SNAPSHOT)\r\n0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/default> select timestamp'2021-01-01 01:02:03.000001' - date'2020-12-31';\r\nError: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unrecognized type name: day-time interval (state=,code=0)\r\n```\r\n3. It should unblock https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32099 which enables `*.sql` tests in `ThriftServerQueryTestSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes:\r\n```sql\r\n0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/default> select timestamp'2021-01-01 01:02:03.000001' - date'2020-12-31';\r\n+----------------------------------------------------+\r\n|

|\r\n+----------------------------------------------------+\r\n1 row selected (1.637 seconds)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test:\r\n```\r\n$ ./build/sbt -Phive

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Extend `IntervalUtils` methods: `toYearMonthIntervalString` and `toDayTimeIntervalString` to support formatting of year-month/day-time intervals in Hive style. The methods get new parameter style which can have to values; `HIVE_STYLE` and `ANSI_STYLE`.\r\n2. Invoke `toYearMonthIntervalString` and `toDayTimeIntervalString` from the `Cast` expression with the `style` parameter is set to `ANSI_STYLE`.\r\n3. Invoke `toYearMonthIntervalString` and `toDayTimeIntervalString` from `HiveResult` with `style` is set to `HIVE_STYLE`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe `spark-sql` shell formats its output in Hive style by using `HiveResult.hiveResultString()`. The changes are needed to match Hive behavior. For instance,\r\n\r\nHive:\r\n```sql\r\n0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/default> select timestamp'2021-01-01 01:02:03.000001' - date'2020-12-31';\r\n+-----------------------+\r\n|          _c0          |\r\n+-----------------------+\r\n| 1 01:02:03.000001000  |\r\n+-----------------------+\r\n``` \r\n\r\nSpark before the changes:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select timestamp'2021-01-01 01:02:03.000001' - date'2020-12-31';\r\nINTERVAL '1 01:02:03.000001' DAY TO SECOND\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso this should unblock #32099 which enables *.sql tests in `SQLQueryTestSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select timestamp'2021-01-01 01:02:03.000001' - date'2020-12-31';\r\n1 01:02:03.000001000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Added new tests to `IntervalUtilsSuite`:\r\n```\r\n$  build/sbt \"test:testOnly *IntervalUtilsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n2. Modified existing tests in `HiveResultSuite`:\r\n```\r\n$  build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"testOnly *HiveResultSuite\"\r\n```\r\n3. By running cast tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nNow that we merged the Koalas main code into the PySpark code base (#32036), we should port the Koalas Series related unit tests to PySpark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, the pandas-on-Spark modules are not fully tested. We should enable the Series related unit tests first.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nEnable Series-related unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis patch proposes a fix to prevent triggering BlockManager reregistration while `StopExecutor` msg is in-flight.\r\nHere on receiving `StopExecutor` msg, we do not remove the corresponding `BlockManagerInfo` from `blockManagerInfo` map, instead we mark it as dead by updating the corresponding `executorRemovalTs`. There's a separate cleanup thread running to periodically remove the stale `BlockManagerInfo` from `blockManangerInfo` map.\r\n\r\nNow if a recently removed `BlockManager` tries to register, the driver simply ignores it since the `blockManagerInfo` map already contains an entry for it. The same applies to `BlockManagerHeartbeat`, if the BlockManager belongs to a recently removed executor, the `blockManagerInfo` map would contain an entry and we shall not ask the corresponding `BlockManager` to re-register.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis changes are needed since BlockManager reregistration while executor is shutting down causes inconsistent bookkeeping of executors in Spark.\r\nConsider the following scenario:\r\n- `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` issues async `StopExecutor` on executorEndpoint\r\n- `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` removes that executor from Driver's internal data structures and publishes `SparkListenerExecutorRemoved` on the `listenerBus`.\r\n- Executor has still not processed `StopExecutor` from the Driver\r\n- Driver receives heartbeat from the Executor, since it cannot find the `executorId` in its data structures, it responds with `HeartbeatResponse(reregisterBlockManager = true)`\r\n- `BlockManager` on the Executor reregisters with the `BlockManagerMaster` and `SparkListenerBlockManagerAdded` is published on the `listenerBus`\r\n- Executor starts processing the `StopExecutor` and exits\r\n- `AppStatusListener` picks the `SparkListenerBlockManagerAdded` event and updates `AppStatusStore`\r\n- `statusTracker.getExecutorInfos` refers `AppStatusStore` to get the list of executors which returns the dead executor as alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Modified the existing unittests.\r\n- Ran a simple test application on minikube that asserts on number of executors are zero once the executor idle timeout is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR allows non-aggregated correlated scalar subquery if the max output row is less than 2. Correlated scalar subqueries need to be aggregated because they are going to be decorrelated and rewritten as LEFT OUTER joins. If the correlated scalar subquery produces more than one output row, the rewrite will yield wrong results. \r\n\r\nBut this constraint can be relaxed when the subquery plan's the max number of output rows is less than or equal to 1. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo relax a constraint in CheckAnalysis for the correlated scalar subquery.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-09T18:23:16Z","updated_at":"2024-01-19T01:22:05Z","closed_at":"2021-04-13T07:27:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7b4833aa75180f8b0c5806df29694ed7a8119361","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32111/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32111/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32111/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/00d8c1bef882163d948d8b72bcb44d2382b99b91","head":{"label":"allisonwang-db:spark-28379-aggregated","ref":"spark-28379-aggregated","sha":"00d8c1bef882163d948d8b72bcb44d2382b99b91","user":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":271915022,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzE5MTUwMjI=","name":"spark","full_name":"allisonwang-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds the typehint of pyspark.__version__, which was mentioned in [SPARK-34630](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34630).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere were some short discussion happened in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31823#discussion_r593830911 .\r\n\r\nAfter further deep investigation on [1][2], we can see the `pyspark.__version__` is added by [setup.py](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c06758834e6192b1888b4a885c612a151588b390/python/setup.py#L201), it makes `__version__` embedded into pyspark module, that means the `__init__.pyi` is the right place to add the typehint for `__version__`. \r\n\r\nSo, this patch adds the type hint `__version__` in pyspark/__init__.pyi.\r\n\r\n[1] [PEP-396 Module Version Numbers](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0396/)\r\n[2] https://packaging.python.org/guides/single-sourcing-package-version/\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Disable the ignore_error on\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ee7bf7d9628384548d09ac20e30992dd705c20f4/python/mypy.ini#L132\r\n\r\n2. Run mypy:\r\n- Before fix\r\n```shell\r\n(venv) ➜  spark git:(SPARK-34629) ✗ mypy --config-file python/mypy.ini python/pyspark | grep version\r\npython/pyspark/pandas/spark/accessors.py:884: error: Module has no attribute \"__version__\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n- After fix\r\n```shell\r\n(venv) ➜  spark git:(SPARK-34629) ✗ mypy --config-file python/mypy.ini python/pyspark | grep version\r\n```\r\nno

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd check if the byte length over `int`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe encounter a very extreme case with expression `concat_ws`, and the error msg is\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String.concatWs\r\n```\r\nSeems the `UTF8String.concat` has already done the length check at [#21064](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21064), so it's better to add in `concatWs`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nImplements `readShorts` in `VectorizedPlainValuesReader`, which decodes `total` shorts in the input buffer at one time, similar to other types.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently `VectorizedRleValuesReader` reads short integer in the following way:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\r\n  c.putShort(rowId + i, (short)data.readInteger());\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFor PLAIN encoding `data.readInteger` is done via:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic final int readInteger() {\r\n  return getBuffer(4).getInt();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich means it needs to repeatedly call `slice` buffer for the batch size number of times. This is more expensive than calling it once in a big chunk and then reading the ints out.\r\n\r\nMicro benchmark via `DataSourceReadBenchmark` showed ~35% perf improvement.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\n[info] OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 11.0.8+10-LTS on Mac OS X 10.16\r\n[info] Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n[info] SQL Single SMALLINT Column Scan:          Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n[info] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[info] SQL CSV                                           10249          10271          32          1.5         651.6       1.0X\r\n[info] SQL Json                                           5963           5982          28          2.6         379.1       1.7X\r\n[info] SQL Parquet Vectorized                              141            151          15        111.9           8.9      72.9X\r\n[info] SQL Parquet MR                                     1454           1491          52         10.8          92.4       7.0X\r\n[info] SQL ORC Vectorized                                  160            164           3         98.3          10.2      64.1X\r\n[info] SQL ORC MR                                         1133           1164          44         13.9          72.0       9.0X\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n[info] OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 11.0.8+10-LTS on Mac OS X 10.16\r\n[info] Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n[info] SQL Single SMALLINT Column Scan:          Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n[info] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[info] SQL CSV                                           10489          10535          65          1.5         666.8       1.0X\r\n[info] SQL Json                                           5864           5888          34          2.7         372.8       1.8X\r\n[info] SQL Parquet Vectorized                              104            111           8        151.0           6.6     100.7X\r\n[info] SQL Parquet MR                                     1458           1472          20         10.8          92.7       7.2X\r\n[info] SQL ORC Vectorized                                  157            166           7        100.0          10.0      66.7X\r\n[info] SQL ORC MR                                         1121           1147          37         14.0          71.2       9.4X\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemove `spark.sql.legacy.interval.enabled` settings from `SQLQueryTestSuite`/`ThriftServerQueryTestSuite` that enables new ANSI intervals by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo use default settings for intervals, and test new ANSI intervals - year-month and day-time interval introduced by SPARK-27793.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nShould not because this affects tests only.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected tests, for instance:\r\n```\r\n$

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to leverage the GitHub Actions resources from the forked repositories instead of using the resources in ASF organisation at GitHub.\r\n\r\nThis is how it works:\r\n\r\n1. \"Build and test\" (`build_and_test.yml`)  triggers a build on any commit on any branch (except `branch-*.*`), which roughly means:\r\n    - The original repository will trigger the build on any commits in `master` branch\r\n    - The forked repository will trigger the build on any commit in any branch.\r\n2. The build triggered in the forked repository will checkout the original repository's `master` branch locally, and merge the branch from the forked repository into the original repository's `master` branch locally.\r\n  Therefore, the tests in the forked repository will run after being sync'ed with the original repository's `master` branch.\r\n3. In the original repository, it triggers a workflow that detects the workflow triggered in the forked repository, and add a comment, to the PR, pointing out the workflow in forked repository.\r\n\r\nIn short, please **see this example HyukjinKwon#34** \r\n\r\n1. You create a PR and your repository triggers the workflow. Your PR uses the resources allocated to you for testing.\r\n2. Apache Spark repository finds your workflow, and links it in a comment in your PR\r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTE** that we will still run the tests in the original repository for each commit pushed to `master` branch. This distributes the workflows only in PRs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nASF shares the resources across all the ASF projects, which makes the development slow down.\r\nPlease see also:\r\n- Discussion in the builds@a.o mailing list: https://lists.apache.org/x/thread.html/r48d079eeff292254db22705c8ef8618f87ff7adc68d56c4e5d0b4105@%3Cbuilds.apache.org%3E\r\n- Infra ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-21646\r\n\r\nBy distributing the workflows to use author's resources, we can get around this issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is a dev-only change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested at https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark/pull/34 and

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe `explain()` method prints the arguments of tree nodes in logical/physical plans. The arguments could contain a map-type option that contains sensitive data.\r\nWe should map-type options in the output of `explain()`. Otherwise, we will see sensitive data in explain output or Spark UI.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/113719178-326ffb00-96a2-11eb-8a2c-28fca3e72941.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- Split plan into several groups, and every child of union is a new group\r\n- Coalesce paritition for every group\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### First Issue\r\nThe rule `CoalesceShufflePartitions` can only coalesce paritition if\r\n* leaf node is ShuffleQueryStage\r\n* all shuffle have same partition number\r\n\r\nWith `Union`, it might break the assumption. Let's say we have such plan\r\n```\r\nUnion\r\n   HashAggregate\r\n      ShuffleQueryStage\r\n   FileScan\r\n```\r\n`CoalesceShufflePartitions` can not optimize it and the result partition would be `shuffle partition + FileScan partition` which can be quite lagre.\r\n\r\nIt's better to support partial optimize with `Union`.\r\n\r\n#### Second Issue\r\nthe coalesce partition formule used the **sum value** as the total input size and it's not friendly for union, see\r\n```\r\n// ShufflePartitionsUtil.coalescePartitions\r\nval totalPostShuffleInputSize = mapOutputStatistics.flatMap(_.map(_.bytesByPartitionId.sum)).sum\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo for such case:\r\n```\r\nUnion\r\n   HashAggregate\r\n      ShuffleQueryStage\r\n   HashAggregate\r\n      ShuffleQueryStage\r\n```\r\nThe `CoalesceShufflePartitions` rule will return an unexpected partition number.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nProbably yes, the result partition might changed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdd test.","created_at":"2021-04-08T02:54:38Z","updated_at":"2021-09-29T09:56:37Z","closed_at":"2021-09-29T08:32:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1867757ef1fafa95dbf673be6642f905204423d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32084/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32084/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32084/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b2e3848d29a99ff415edfc4cb128b1ea6fd685cf","head":{"label":"ulysses-you:SPARK-34980","ref":"SPARK-34980","sha":"b2e3848d29a99ff415edfc4cb128b1ea6fd685cf","user":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195747855,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU3NDc4NTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"ulysses-you/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nNow that we merged the Koalas main code into the PySpark code base (#32036), we should port the Koalas DataFrame unit test to PySpark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, the pandas-on-Spark modules are not tested at all. We should enable the DataFrame unit test first.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nEnable the DataFrame unit

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis implements function resolution and evaluation for functions registered through V2 FunctionCatalog [SPARK-27658](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27658). In particular:\r\n- Added documentation for how to define the \"magic method\" in `ScalarFunction`.\r\n- Added a new expression `ApplyFunctionExpression` which evaluates input by delegating to `ScalarFunction.produceResult` method.\r\n- added a new expression `V2Aggregator` which is a type of `TypedImperativeAggregate`. It's a wrapper of V2 `AggregateFunction` and mostly delegate methods to the implementation of the latter. It also uses plain Java serde for intermediate state.\r\n- Added function resolution logic for `ScalarFunction` and `AggregateFunction` in `Analyzer`. \r\n  + For `ScalarFunction` this checks if the magic method is implemented through Java reflection, and create a `Invoke` expression if so. Otherwise, it checks if the default `produceResult` is overridden. If so, it creates a `ApplyFunctionExpression` which evaluates through `InternalRow`. Otherwise an analysis exception is thrown.\r\n + For `AggregateFunction`, this checks if the `update` method is overridden. If so, it converts it to `V2Aggregator`. Otherwise an analysis exception is thrown similar to the case of `ScalarFunction`.\r\n- Extended existing `InMemoryTableCatalog` to add the function catalog capability. Also renamed it to `InMemoryCatalog` since it no longer only covers tables.\r\n\r\n**Note**: this currently can successfully detect whether a subclass overrides the default `produceResult` or `update` method from the parent interface **only for Java implementations**. It seems in Scala it's hard to differentiate whether a subclass overrides a default method from its parent interface. In this case, it will be a runtime error instead of analysis error.\r\n\r\nA few TODOs:\r\n- Extend `V2SessionCatalog` with function catalog. This seems a little tricky since API such V2 `FunctionCatalog`'s `loadFunction` is different from V1 `SessionCatalog`'s `lookupFunction`.\r\n- Add magic method for `AggregateFunction`. \r\n- Type coercion when looking up functions\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs V2 FunctionCatalog APIs are finalized, we should integrate it with function resolution and evaluation process so that they are actually useful.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, now a function exposed through V2 FunctionCatalog can be analyzed and evaluated.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded new unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nClose SparkContext after the Main method has finished, to allow SparkApplication on K8S to complete\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nif I don't call the method sparkContext.stop() explicitly, then a Spark driver process doesn't terminate even after its Main method has been completed. This behaviour is different from spark on yarn, where the manual sparkContext stopping is not required. It looks like, the problem is in using non-daemon threads, which prevent the driver jvm process from terminating.\r\nSo I have inserted code that closes sparkContext automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually on the production AWS EKS environment in my company.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-07T21:22:44Z","updated_at":"2021-07-16T01:36:04Z","closed_at":"2021-04-08T23:51:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2159418a68b3c19abcc1643b8504b1324158177b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32081/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32081/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32081/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e3946b459533dbeb92d873d3587cf6af7ca8ad34","head":{"label":"kotlovs:close-spark-context-on-exit","ref":"close-spark-context-on-exit","sha":"e3946b459533dbeb92d873d3587cf6af7ca8ad34","user":{"login":"kotlovs","id":47977899,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTc3ODk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47977899?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs","html_url":"https://github.com/kotlovs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355531719,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1MzE3MTk=","name":"spark","full_name":"kotlovs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kotlovs","id":47977899,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTc3ODk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47977899?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs","html_url":"https://github.com/kotlovs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kotlovs/spark","description":"Apache

hongdd <hongdongdong@cmss.chinamobile.com>\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupporting `SparkAppHandle` object to be able to manage a running Spark application on Kubernetes. It can be used to monitor the application changes and to stop the application by pod deletion.\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been raised due to a inactivity of a previous one - https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30520\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere is an inconsistency in the Spark application managing with `SparkAppHandle` object between Kubernetes and other resource managers such as Yarn/Mesos.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this feature is not properly implemented on Kubernetes which may cause some issues. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it changes the behavior of `SparkAppHandle` object which the user may use to communicate with the launched Spark application. Its interface is remained as it is. Some missing functionalities have been implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nFew unit tests has been added. May be found in `org.apache.spark.deploy.k8s.submit` package:\r\n- `PodStatusWatcherSuite` - new ones\r\n- `ClientSuite` - added

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn #30965 we changed to CBO cost comparison function so it would be \"symetric\": `A.betterThan(B)` now implies, that `!B.betterThan(A)`.\r\nWith that we caused a performance regressions in some queries - TPCDS q19 for example.\r\n\r\nThe original cost comparison function used the ratios `relativeRows = A.rowCount / B.rowCount` and `relativeSize = A.size / B.size`. The changed function compared \"absolute\" cost values `costA = w*A.rowCount + (1-w)*A.size` and `costB = w*B.rowCount + (1-w)*B.size`.\r\n\r\nGiven the input from @wzhfy we decided to go back to the relative values, because otherwise one (size) may overwhelm the other (rowCount). But this time we avoid adding up the ratios.\r\n\r\nOriginally `A.betterThan(B) => w*relativeRows + (1-w)*relativeSize < 1` was used. Besides being \"non-symteric\", this also can exhibit one overwhelming other. \r\nFor `w=0.5` If `A` size (bytes) is at least 2x larger than `B`, then no matter how many times more rows does the `B` plan have, `B` will allways be considered to be better - `0.5*2 + 0.5*0.00000000000001 > 1`.\r\n\r\nWhen working with ratios, then it would be better to multiply them.\r\nThe proposed cost comparison function is: `A.betterThan(B) => relativeRows^w  * relativeSize^(1-w) < 1`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nComparison of the changed TPCDS v1.4 query execution times at sf=10:\r\n\r\n  | absolute | multiplicative |   | additive |  \r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nq12 | 145 | 137 | -5.52% | 141 | -2.76%\r\nq13 | 264 | 271 | 2.65% | 271 | 2.65%\r\nq17 | 4521 | 4243 | -6.15% | 4348 | -3.83%\r\nq18 | 758 | 466 | -38.52% | 480 | -36.68%\r\nq19 | 38503 | 2167 | -94.37% | 2176 | -94.35%\r\nq20 | 119 | 120 | 0.84% | 126 | 5.88%\r\nq24a | 16429 | 16838 | 2.49% | 17103 | 4.10%\r\nq24b | 16592 | 16999 | 2.45% | 17268 | 4.07%\r\nq25 | 3558 | 3556 | -0.06% | 3675 | 3.29%\r\nq33 | 362 | 361 | -0.28% | 380 | 4.97%\r\nq52 | 1020 | 1032 | 1.18% | 1052 | 3.14%\r\nq55 | 927 | 938 | 1.19% | 961 | 3.67%\r\nq72 | 24169 | 13377 | -44.65% | 24306 | 0.57%\r\nq81 | 1285 | 1185 | -7.78% | 1168 | -9.11%\r\nq91 | 324 | 336 | 3.70% | 337 | 4.01%\r\nq98 | 126 | 129 | 2.38% | 131 | 3.97%\r\n\r\nAll times are in ms, the change is compared to the situation in the master branch (absolute). \r\nThe proposed cost function (multiplicative) significantlly improves the performance on q18, q19 and q72. The original cost function (additive) has similar improvements at q18 and q19. All other chagnes are within the error bars and I would ignore them - perhaps q81 has also improved.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn #30965 we changed to CBO cost comparison function so it would be \"symetric\": `A.betterThan(B)` now implies, that `!B.betterThan(A)`.\r\nWith that we caused a performance regressions in some queries - TPCDS q19 for example.\r\n\r\nThe original cost comparison function used the ratios `relativeRows = A.rowCount / B.rowCount` and `relativeSize = A.size / B.size`. The changed function compared \"absolute\" cost values `costA = w*A.rowCount + (1-w)*A.size` and `costB = w*B.rowCount + (1-w)*B.size`.\r\n\r\nGiven the input from @wzhfy we decided to go back to the relative values, because otherwise one (size) may overwhelm the other (rowCount). But this time we avoid adding up the ratios.\r\n\r\nOriginally `A.betterThan(B) => w*relativeRows + (1-w)*relativeSize < 1` was used. Besides being \"non-symteric\", this also can exhibit one overwhelming other. \r\nFor `w=0.5` If `A` size (bytes) is at least 2x larger than `B`, then no matter how many times more rows does the `B` plan have, `B` will allways be considered to be better - `0.5*2 + 0.5*0.00000000000001 > 1`.\r\n\r\nWhen working with ratios, then it would be better to multiply them.\r\nThe proposed cost comparison function is: `A.betterThan(B) => relativeRows^w  * relativeSize^(1-w) < 1`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nComparison of the changed TPCDS v1.4 query execution times at sf=10:\r\n\r\n  | absolute | multiplicative |   | additive |  \r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nq12 | 145 | 137 | -5.52% | 141 | -2.76%\r\nq13 | 264 | 271 | 2.65% | 271 | 2.65%\r\nq17 | 4521 | 4243 | -6.15% | 4348 | -3.83%\r\nq18 | 758 | 466 | -38.52% | 480 | -36.68%\r\nq19 | 38503 | 2167 | -94.37% | 2176 | -94.35%\r\nq20 | 119 | 120 | 0.84% | 126 | 5.88%\r\nq24a | 16429 | 16838 | 2.49% | 17103 | 4.10%\r\nq24b | 16592 | 16999 | 2.45% | 17268 | 4.07%\r\nq25 | 3558 | 3556 | -0.06% | 3675 | 3.29%\r\nq33 | 362 | 361 | -0.28% | 380 | 4.97%\r\nq52 | 1020 | 1032 | 1.18% | 1052 | 3.14%\r\nq55 | 927 | 938 | 1.19% | 961 | 3.67%\r\nq72 | 24169 | 13377 | -44.65% | 24306 | 0.57%\r\nq81 | 1285 | 1185 | -7.78% | 1168 | -9.11%\r\nq91 | 324 | 336 | 3.70% | 337 | 4.01%\r\nq98 | 126 | 129 | 2.38% | 131 | 3.97%\r\n\r\nAll times are in ms, the change is compared to the situation in the master branch (absolute). \r\nThe proposed cost function (multiplicative) significantlly improves the performance on q18, q19 and q72. The original cost function (additive) has similar improvements at q18 and q19. All other chagnes are within the error bars and I would ignore them - perhaps q81 has also improved.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that `LIST FILES/JARS/ARCHIVES path1 path2 ...` cannot list all paths if at least one path is quoted.\r\nAn example here.\r\n```\r\nADD FILE /tmp/test1;\r\nADD FILE /tmp/test2;\r\n\r\nLIST FILES /tmp/test1 /tmp/test2;\r\nfile:/tmp/test1\r\nfile:/tmp/test2\r\n\r\nLIST FILES /tmp/test1 \"/tmp/test2\";\r\nfile:/tmp/test2\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, the second `LIST FILES` doesn't show `file:/tmp/test1`.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this issue, I modified the syntax rule to be able to handle this case.\r\nI also changed `SparkSQLParser` to be able to handle paths which contains white spaces.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a bug.\r\nI also have a plan which extends `ADD FILE/JAR/ARCHIVE` to take multiple paths like Hive and the syntax rule change is necessary for that.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Users can pass quoted paths when using `ADD FILE/JAR/ARCHIVE`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR implements the decorrelation technique in the paper \"Unnesting Arbitrary Queries\" by T. Neumann; A. Kemper\r\n(http://www.btw-2015.de/res/proceedings/Hauptband/Wiss/Neumann-Unnesting_Arbitrary_Querie.pdf). It currently supports Filter, Project, Aggregate, Join, and UnaryNode that passes CheckAnalysis. \r\n\r\nThis feature can be controlled by the config `spark.sql.optimizer.decorrelateInnerQuery.enabled` (default: true).\r\n\r\nA few notes:\r\n1. This PR does not relax any constraints in CheckAnalysis for correlated subqueries, even though some cases can be supported by this new framework, such as aggregate with correlated non-equality predicates. This PR focuses on adding the new framework and making sure all existing cases can be supported. Constraints can be relaxed gradually in the future via separate PRs.\r\n2. The new framework is only enabled for correlated scalar subqueries, as the first step. EXISTS/IN subqueries can be supported in the future.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, Spark has limited support for correlated subqueries. It only allows `Filter` to reference outer query columns and does not support non-equality predicates when the subquery is aggregated. This new framework will allow more operators to host outer column references and support correlated non-equality predicates and more types of operators in correlated subqueries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit and SQL query tests and new optimizer plan tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-07T03:16:06Z","updated_at":"2024-01-19T01:23:07Z","closed_at":"2021-04-20T09:22:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c0c48fcc9025452a9237f33bf414431ea7445dfb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32072/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32072/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32072/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f665a0d52953ea7927d0d5dee7f4742255173691","head":{"label":"allisonwang-db:spark-34974-decorrelation","ref":"spark-34974-decorrelation","sha":"f665a0d52953ea7927d0d5dee7f4742255173691","user":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":271915022,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzE5MTUwMjI=","name":"spark","full_name":"allisonwang-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, the JDBCRelation columnPartition function orders the strides in ascending order, starting from the lower bound and working its way towards the upper bound.\r\n\r\nI'm proposing leaving that as the default, but adding a new option in JDBCOptions called strideOrder. Since it will default to the current behavior, this will keep people's current code working as expected. However, people who may have data skew closer to the upper bound might appreciate being able to have the strides in descending order, thus filling up the first partition with the last stride and so forth. Also, people with nondeterministic data skew or sporadic data density might be able to benefit from a random ordering of the strides.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt provides options to the end-user to have more control over the JDBC partitioning.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt adds an option called \"strideOrder\" in JDBCOptions. However, by default the code will order the strides/partitions in the same order it did before this PR (ascending). Therefore, it will not require any changes to users' current code, unless they want to take advantage of these new options.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI've created two new unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nSay we have 11 partitions, 5 cores total, and the last partition has triple the amount of data as the first 10 due to data skew. We'll say partitions 1 through 10 take 10 minutes a core, so partition 11 would take 30 minutes on a core.\r\n\r\nCurrent stride order of **ascending**:\r\n\r\n_Group 1_\r\n5 cores x 10 minutes = 10 minutes \r\n\r\n(all running concurrently) total of 10 minutes\r\n\r\n_Group 2_\r\n5 x 10 = 10 \r\n\r\n(all running concurrently) total of 10 minutes\r\n\r\n_Group 3_\r\n1 x 30 = 30\r\n\r\n4 cores sitting idle\r\n\r\ntotal of 30 minutes\r\n\r\nGroup 1 (10) + Group 2 (10) + Group 3 (30)\r\n\r\n**Total of 50 minutes**\r\n\r\n\r\nStride order of **descending**:\r\n\r\n_Group 1_\r\n1 core x 30 minutes = 30 minutes \r\n4 x 10 = 10 (running concurrently with the first core)\r\n4 x 10 = 10 (running concurrently with the first core)\r\n2 x 10 = 10 (running concurrently with the first core)\r\n\r\n**Total of 30

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange UpdateAction and InsertAction of MergeIntoTable to explicitly represent star,\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, UpdateAction and InsertAction in the MergeIntoTable implicitly represent `update set *` and `insert *` with empty assignments. That means there is no way to differentiate between the representations of \"update all columns\" and \"update no columns\". For SQL MERGE queries, this inability does not matter because the SQL MERGE grammar that generated the MergeIntoTable plan does not allow \"update no columns\". However, other ways of generating the MergeIntoTable plan may not have that limitation, and may want to allow specifying \"update no columns\". For example, in the Delta Lake project we provide a type-safe Scala API for Merge, where it is perfectly valid to produce a Merge query with an update clause but no update assignments. Currently, we cannot use MergeIntoTable to represent this plan, thus complicating the generation, and resolution of merge query from scala API.\r\n\r\nSide note: fixed another bug where a merge plan with star and no other expressions with unresolved attributes (e.g. all non-optional predicates are `literal(true)`), then resolution will be skipped and star wont expanded. added test for that.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe `explain()` method prints the arguments of tree nodes in logical/physical plans. The arguments could contain a map-type option that contains sensitive data.\r\nWe should map-type options in the output of `explain()`. Otherwise, we will see sensitive data in explain output or Spark UI.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/113719178-326ffb00-96a2-11eb-8a2c-28fca3e72941.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR refactor https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29695,  it has some limitations in terms of implementation and abstraction:\r\n\r\n1. Don't support `count`\r\n2. Don't support `AVG` in case of multiple partitions, and actually the current implementation is wrong even in single partition.\r\n3. Don't know how to extend for supporting more aggregation case, for example, `sum(if())`.\r\n4. Don’t know how to extend for supporting join push down\r\n\r\nsee the discussion

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR contains:\r\n- TreeNode, QueryPlan, AnalysisHelper changes to allow the transform function family to stop earlier without traversing the entire tree;\r\n- Example changes in a few rules to support such pruning, e.g., ReorderJoin and OptimizeIn.\r\n\r\nHere is a [design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SEUhkbo8X-0cYAJFYFDQhxUnKJBz4lLn3u4xR2qfWqk) that elaborates the ideas and benchmark numbers.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt's a framework-level change for reducing the query compilation time.\r\nIn particular, if we update existing rules and transform call sites as per the examples in this PR, the analysis time and query optimization time can be reduced as described in this [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SEUhkbo8X-0cYAJFYFDQhxUnKJBz4lLn3u4xR2qfWqk) .\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt is tested by existing tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-06T06:48:05Z","updated_at":"2023-04-28T13:11:15Z","closed_at":"2021-04-12T03:21:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"89a5ee18b2cc412694d93ebb8bcb858c1989f917","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32060/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32060/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32060/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/718a92a743e731a698473b9170ace55187755b55","head":{"label":"sigmod:bits","ref":"bits","sha":"718a92a743e731a698473b9170ace55187755b55","user":{"login":"sigmod","id":384788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDc4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod","html_url":"https://github.com/sigmod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355067050,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTUwNjcwNTA=","name":"spark","full_name":"sigmod/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sigmod","id":384788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDc4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod","html_url":"https://github.com/sigmod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sigmod/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange UpdateAction and InsertAction of MergeIntoTable to explicitly represent star,\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, UpdateAction and InsertAction in the MergeIntoTable implicitly represent `update set *` and `insert *` with empty assignments. That means there is no way to differentiate between the representations of \"update all columns\" and \"update no columns\". For SQL MERGE queries, this inability does not matter because the SQL MERGE grammar that generated the MergeIntoTable plan does not allow \"update no columns\". However, other ways of generating the MergeIntoTable plan may not have that limitation, and may want to allow specifying \"update no columns\". For example, in the Delta Lake project we provide a type-safe Scala API for Merge, where it is perfectly valid to produce a Merge query with an update clause but no update assignments.

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe main objective of this change is to improve performance in some cases.\r\nWe have three possibilities when we plan an aggregation. In the first case, with mutable primitive types, HashAggregate is used.\r\nWhen we are not using these types we have two options. If the function implements TypedImperativeAggregate we use ObjectHashAggregate. Otherwise, we use SortAggregate that is less efficient.\r\nIn this PR I propose to migrate First function to implement TypedImperativeAggregate to take advantage of this feature (ObjectAggregateExec)\r\n\r\nBefore the change:\r\n```\r\nscala> Seq((0, \"value\")).toDF(\"key\", \"value\").groupBy(\"key\").agg(first(\"value\")).explain()\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nSortAggregate(key=[key#130], functions=[first(value#131, false)])\r\n+- *(2) Sort [key#130 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   +- Exchange hashpartitioning(key#130, 200), true, [id=#114]\r\n      +- SortAggregate(key=[key#130], functions=[partial_first(value#131, false)])\r\n         +- *(1) Sort [key#130 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n            +- *(1) LocalTableScan [key#130, value#131]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the change:\r\n```\r\nscala> Seq((0, \"value\")).toDF(\"key\", \"value\").groupBy(\"key\").agg(first(\"value\")).explain()\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- ObjectHashAggregate(keys=[key#313], functions=[first(value#314, false, 0, 0)])\r\n   +- Exchange hashpartitioning(key#313, 200), ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [id=#208]\r\n      +- ObjectHashAggregate(keys=[key#313], functions=[partial_first(value#314, false, 0, 0)])\r\n         +- LocalTableScan [key#313, value#314]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo improve the performance of the first function when we are not using mutable primitive types\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the behavior remains equal\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Added new method `toYearMonthIntervalString()` to `IntervalUtils` which converts an year-month interval as a number of month to a string in the form **\"INTERVAL '[sign]yearField-monthField' YEAR TO MONTH\"**.\r\n2. Extended the `Cast` expression to support casting of `YearMonthIntervalType` to `StringType`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo conform the ANSI SQL standard which requires to support such casting.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nShould not because new year-month interval has not been released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new tests

Also, the error messages are confusing:\r\n\r\n#### Case 1: correlated scalar subquery in the grouping expressions but not in aggregate expressions \r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT SUM(c2) FROM t t1 GROUP BY (SELECT SUM(c2) FROM t t2 WHERE t1.c1 = t2.c1)\r\n```\r\nWe get this error:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: Expects 1 field, but got 2; something went wrong in analysis  \r\n```\r\nbecause the correlated scalar subquery is not rewritten properly: \r\n```scala\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nAggregate [scalar-subquery#5 [(c1#6 = c1#6#93)]], [sum(c2#7) AS sum(c2)#11L]\r\n:  +- Aggregate [c1#6], [sum(c2#7) AS sum(c2)#15L, c1#6 AS c1#6#93]\r\n:     +- LocalRelation [c1#6, c2#7]\r\n+- LocalRelation [c1#6, c2#7]\r\n``` \r\n\r\n#### Case 2: correlated scalar subquery in the aggregate expressions but not in the grouping expressions \r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT (SELECT SUM(c2) FROM t t2 WHERE t1.c1 = t2.c1), SUM(c2) FROM t t1 GROUP BY c1\r\n```\r\nWe get this error:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Couldn't find sum(c2)#69L in [c1#60,sum(c2#61)#64L]\r\n```\r\nbecause the transformed correlated scalar subquery output is not present in the grouping expression of the Aggregate:\r\n```scala\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nAggregate [c1#60], [sum(c2)#69L AS scalarsubquery(c1)#70L, sum(c2#61) AS sum(c2)#65L]\r\n+- Project [c1#60, c2#61, sum(c2)#69L]\r\n   +- Join LeftOuter, (c1#60 = c1#60#95)\r\n      :- LocalRelation [c1#60, c2#61]\r\n      +- Aggregate [c1#60], [sum(c2#61) AS sum(c2)#69L, c1#60 AS c1#60#95]\r\n         +- LocalRelation [c1#60, c2#61]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-05T18:04:42Z","updated_at":"2024-01-19T01:22:05Z","closed_at":"2021-04-08T13:03:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7b8465f8e3bab034a140881ec7a610ad6c9f9eb8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32054/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32054/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32054/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/711f408eb1c72c3ae3956689e19474e3e8e5a45b","head":{"label":"allisonwang-db:spark-34946-scalar-subquery-agg","ref":"spark-34946-scalar-subquery-agg","sha":"711f408eb1c72c3ae3956689e19474e3e8e5a45b","user":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":271915022,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzE5MTUwMjI=","name":"spark","full_name":"allisonwang-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db/spark","description":"Apache

So `fs.exists` returns false.\r\n\r\nSo the solution I come up with is removing Hive's `ADD JAR` from `HiveClientimpl.addJar`.\r\nI think Hive's `ADD JAR` was used to add jar files to the class loader for metadata and isolate the class loader from the one for execution.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/6758/files#diff-cdb07de713c84779a5308f65be47964af865e15f00eb9897ccf8a74908d581bbR94-R103\r\n\r\nBut, as of SPARK-10810 and SPARK-10902 (#8909) are resolved, the class loaders for metadata and execution seem to be isolated with different way.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/8909/files#diff-8ef7cabf145d3fe7081da799fa415189d9708892ed76d4d13dd20fa27021d149R635-R641\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation, such class loaders seem to be isolated by `SharedState.jarClassLoader` and `IsolatedClientLoader.classLoader`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/internal/SessionState.scala#L173-L188\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/client/HiveClientImpl.scala#L956-L967\r\n\r\nSo I wonder we can remove Hive's `ADD JAR` from `HiveClientImpl.addJar`.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `zstd` codec names in the Spark generated ORC file names for consistency.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nLike the other ORC supported codecs, we had better have `zstd` in the Spark generated ORC file names. Please note that there is no problem at reading/writing ORC zstd files currently. This PR only aims to revise the file name format for consistency.\r\n\r\n**SNAPPY**\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.range(10).repartition(1).write.option(\"compression\",

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPush down Min/Max/Count to Parquet\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSince parquet has the statistics information for min, max and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to set the system encoding as UTF-8. For some reasons, it looks like GitHub Actions machines changed theirs to ASCII by default. This leads to default encoding/decoding to use ASCII in Python, e.g.) `\"a\".encode()`, and looks like Sphinx depends on that.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo recover GItHub Actions build.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested in
