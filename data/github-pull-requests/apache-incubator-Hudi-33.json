Rollback previously applied commits to MDT when operations are retried.\n\n### Change Logs\n\nOperations like Clean, Compaction are retried after failures with the same instant time. If the previous run of the operation successfully committed to the MDT but failed to commit to the dataset, then the operation will be retried later with the same instantTime causing duplicate updates applied to MDT.\n\nCurrently, we simply delete the completed deltacommit without rolling back the deltacommit.\n\nTo handle this, we detect a replay of operation and rollback any changes from that operation in MDT.\n\n### Impact\n\nFixes the issue of duplicate log blocks written in the MDT. This is deterimental for indexes where duplicates are not allowed.\n\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\n\nNone.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn #8499 , a user has raised a very reasonable requirement:\r\n\r\nCurrently, if the insert statement specifies less columns than the target table size, the following exception will be thrown:\r\n\r\n> Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: The number of insert assignments[3] must equal to the targetTable field size[4]\r\n\r\nFor a wide table that has 1000 columns, the user is required to specify all the columns with default values null to avoid this exception. Can we support partial insert in merge into (default to null if not specified) command so the developer can maintain clean SQL statement.\r\n\r\nE.g. Delta merge command has already supported this.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1525333/235104174-20813955-df97-404c-a641-12306774528b.png)\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.databricks.com/sql/language-manual/delta-merge-into.html\r\n\r\nThis

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen a global failover for a Flink job is triggered, it's safer to recreate the `StreamWriteOperatorCoordinator`. Otherwise, all exceptions caused by the coordinator itself will not auto-heal.\r\n\r\nFlink offers a [`RecreateOnResetOperatorCoordinator`](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/checkpoint/StateAssignmentOperation.java) that can be used to restart the coordinator when resetting to a checkpoint (a global failover is triggered).\r\n\r\nThis fixes #8554.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo major impact\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen a global failover for a Flink job is triggered, it's safer to recreate a new `StreamWriteOperatorCoordinator`. Otherwise, all exceptions caused by the coordinator itself will not auto-heal. \r\n\r\nFlink offers a `RecreateOnResetOperatorCoordinator` that can be used to restart the coordinator when resetting to a checkpoint (a global failover is triggered).\r\n\r\nThis should fix #8554.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAll write support classes should extend HoodieAvoWriteSupport, the change uses Reflection APIs, to load sub classes of HoodieAvroWriteSupport. This approach is useful to override writeContext and other methods.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nBy default HoodieAvoWriteSupport is still used, so there is not impact.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nA new config hoodie.avro.write.support.class is added under HoodieStorageConfig class, which is used to load sub classes of HoodieAvoWriteSupport ar runtime.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI

Change Logs\r\nPR Cloned from: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5965\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the `HoodieCleaner` utility so that errors will propagate to spark + YARN (or whatever RM you are using). \r\n\r\nCurrently, if the cleaner fails for any reason the application status (in YARN) is not set to `FAILED`. When running the cleaner outside of the write process (such as DeltaStreamer) this result in a job that cannot be tracked by the coordinating system. We are using Apache Airflow to run the cleaner in parallel on our tables. If the cleaner fails, we need the application status to be set to `FAILED` so that the airflow sensor for the job can alert us. \r\n\r\nThere was an [old issue and PR](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1749) created to catch all cleaner errors and log them. According to the ticket, the change was done because the cleaner process was hanging during certain scenarios. I have not been able to reproduce this behavior. There is no information about the environment on the ticket (possibly only occurred under spark 2.x?)\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMinor impact. This would only negatively impact users who currently rely on failures in the async cleaner to return SUCCESS in resource managers like YARN. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nUpdated java docs and added tests to demonstrate gotchas when using PartialUpdateAvroPayload.\r\n\r\n**Brief description**\r\n\r\nWhen `preCombine` is called for records of of keys to be updated and the incoming data is a combination of outdated + new states, the end state of the record will be somewhat counter-intuitive due to Hudi's exsiting design.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTable schema: {id: int , name: string, price: double, _ts: int}\r\nrecordKey: id\r\nprecombineField: _ts\r\n\r\nTable initial state:\r\n[1    a1_0    10.0    1000]\r\n\r\nTable performs an update with an incoming batch that has the following values (2):\r\n(precombine + combineAndGetUpdateValue)\r\n[\r\n  [1    a1_0    11.0     999],\r\n  [1    a1_0    null     1001]\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnd state of the table:\r\n[1    a1_0    11.0    1001]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is so as the incoming batch at (2) will be `preCombine` before performing a `combineAndUpdateValue`.\r\n\r\nResults will be different if `combineAndUpdateValue` is invoked in order without invoking `preCombine`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nTable initial state:\r\n[1    a1_0    10.0    1000]\r\n\r\nTable performs an update with the values: \r\n(combineAndGetUpdateValue)\r\n[1    a1_0    11.0     999]\r\n\r\nTable performs an update again with the values: \r\n(combineAndGetUpdateValue)\r\n[1    a1_0   null     1001]\r\n\r\nEnd state of the table:\r\n[1    a1_0   10.0    1001]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone, changes made are docs and tests to clarify gotchas on how PartialUpdateAvroPayload handles records that are arriving late (unordered data)\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-26T06:57:50Z","updated_at":"2023-05-15T08:49:25Z","closed_at":"2023-05-11T10:15:13Z","merged_at":"2023-05-11T10:15:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"e331141232ccef12336a6ebd8db4c0355426a015","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/8579/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/8579/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/8579/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/97fd8fb26924eecfce57c58168018dbd333b9be2","head":{"label":"voonhous:minor_add_partial_update_gotchas","ref":"minor_add_partial_update_gotchas","sha":"97fd8fb26924eecfce57c58168018dbd333b9be2","user":{"login":"voonhous","id":6312314,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTIzMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6312314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous","html_url":"https://github.com/voonhous","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":530539338,"node_id":"R_kgDOH59jSg","name":"hudi","full_name":"voonhous/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"voonhous","id":6312314,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTIzMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6312314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous","html_url":"https://github.com/voonhous","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voonhous/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/voonhous/hudi","description":"Upserts,

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWith spark datasource writes, if same batch of data is being ingested again, hudi will re-ingest them as though its a new batch of data. But if users prefer to skip certain batch, this patch adds such support. Two additional configs are introduced, namely `hoodie.datasource.write.writer.identifier` and `hoodie.datasource.write.batch.identifier`. `hoodie.datasource.write.writer.identifier` uniquely identifies a writer and `hoodie.datasource.write.batch.identifier` refers to identifier of the batch and it has to be monotonically increasing for subsequent batches from the same writer. So, if users prefers to leverage this feature, they need to set these two configs. If hudi detects duplicate batches being ingested, it will skip ingesting again. If not set, every batch of data will be ingested. \r\nUsers can also leverage this with streaming source if they are writing to hudi via forEachBatch() api. For a user writing to hudi using StreamingSink, idempotency is automatically handled and users don't need to set any additional configs. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWill assist users to ensure their spark datasource writes to hudi is idempotent. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nOur configuration update should take care of it.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Fixing checkpoint management for multiple streaming writers. Fix is that, each writer updates the checkpoint in commit metadata with its own batchId info only. When checking to skip current batch, we walk back in the timeline and find current writer's last committed batchId. \r\n- Also fixed bulk insert row writer path for checkpoint management with streaming writes. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- Ensure idempotency for multiple streaming writers using spark structured streaming. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A \r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

there is no data in the last batch. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNow we will commit the instant even when there is no data in current batch, thus there maybe some useless commits on the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up fix for #8111.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `hoodie.auto.adjust.lock.configs` opiton is by default false for batch mode ingestion,\r\nand true for spark streaming sink and delta_streamer, while MDT is by default enabled.\r\n\r\nFor multiple streaming writers with no explicit lock provider set up, `InProcessLockProvider` should not be used.\r\n\r\nChange list:\r\n1. Restrict the option `hoodie.auto.adjust.lock.configs` to take effect in single writer scope, because for multi-writer, the\r\n`InProcessLockProvider` can not work as expected among hosts/processes;\r\n2. The LockManager #lock and #unlock are invoked from the TransactionManager\r\nwhich already does the checks for the requirement of an explicit lock, remove the redundant check in LockManager.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Optimize log block reading by removing seeks to check corrupted blocks.\n\n### Change Logs\n\n1. Removed the eager check for isBlockCorrupted after reading block size in HoodieLogFileReader\n2. Added validation checks after reading each item (version, size, blockType, content, etc) from the log block\n3. Added a unit test which generated various corruption scenarios and validates that the corrupted blocks are found\n\n### Impact\n\nImproved performance of reading a log file when there is high latency or a large number of log blocks exist.\n\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\n\nNone\n\n### Documentation Update\n\nNone\n\n### Contributor's checklist\n\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\n- [ ] CI

This is correction in multi-writer usecases where other commits could have happened between the failed commit and the rollback block.\nAdded a unit test\n\n### Impact\n\nLog blocks will be correctly rolled back when using non optimized scanner and multi-writer\n\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\n\nNone\n\n### Documentation Update\n\nNone\n\n### Contributor's checklist\n\n- [

Use UnBoundedCompactionStrategy for MDT compactions.\n\n### Change Logs\n\nChanged the MDT compaction strategy to UnBoundedCompactionStrategy.\n\nCompaction on metadata table is used as a barrier for archiving on main dataset and for validating the deltacommits having corresponding completed commits. Therefore, we need to compact all fileslices of all partitions together requiring UnBoundedCompactionStrategy.\n\n### Impact\n\nCorrects compaction on MDT when large amount of log data is to be compacted. Without this change, the current default strategy (LogFileSizeBasedCompactionStrategy) may only compact some file groups.\n\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\n\nNone\n\n### Documentation Update\n\nNone\n\n### Contributor's checklist\n\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\n- [ ] CI

Improved the performance of checking for valid commits when tagging record location.\n\n### Change Logs\n\n1. Moved the checkIfValidCommit function to HoodieIndexUtils so that it can be shared across various indexes.\n2. checkIfValidCommit not accepts a HoodieTimeline instead of HoodieTableMetaClient. Hence, the timeline does not need to be computed for checking each and every record.\n3. Fixes HoodieInMemoryHashIndex which was not checking for valid commit when tagging location.\n\n### Impact\n\nImproved performance when tagging a large number of records.\n\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\n\nNone. \n\nBasically a code reorg.\n\n### Documentation Update\n\nNone\n\n### Contributor's checklist\n\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\n- [ ] CI

[HUDI-6098] Use bulk insert prepped for the initial write into MDT.\n\n### Change Logs\n\n1. Added a flag to HoodieTableMetadataWriter.commit to specify if the commit is an initial commit\n2. For initial commit, bulkInsertPrepped API is used\n3. Added a partitioner for MDT bulk insert which partitions the records based on their file Group. Since the records are already tagged before calling commit, this partitioner can retrieve the fileID and partition from the current location of the record.\n\n### Impact\n\nMassive increase in read performance after initial creation of a index.\nReduces the large read/write IO requirement for the first compaction in MDT.\nReduces the duplicate storage of initial log files keeping the redundant initial commit  data until cleaned.\nFaster initial commit as bulkInsert is more performant for billions of records than upsert which has a workload profiling stage.\n\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\n\nNone\n\nAlready covered by existing unit tests.\n\n### Documentation Update\n\nNone\n\n### Contributor's checklist\n\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\n- [ ] CI passed\n","created_at":"2023-04-18T19:51:50Z","updated_at":"2023-05-23T20:04:46Z","closed_at":"2023-05-23T20:04:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"13244c4fe0e4dc939fe7289ce29c9e7735138667","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719800718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAwNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:critical","name":"priority:critical","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":"production

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen using global index (bloom or simple), and update partition is set to true. There is a chance where record is in p1 at the beginning, and later updated to p2, when updating to p3 and compaction not yet happened, global index joined both old versions of the record in p1 and p2, and tagged 2 records to insert to p3. This sort of duplicates will reside in the dataset and won't be reconciled unless manually dedup the table.\r\n\r\nWhen records are inserted into new partitions, existing logic does not honor custom payload, which should be handled by record merger API.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nGlobal index will load fileslice to perform merge and tagging, which slows down the whole process if a lot partition updates happen.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nHigh.\r\n\r\n- [ ] End to end testing and UT.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n- [ ]  New config

Reuse schema objects while deserializing log blocks.\n\n### Change Logs\n\n1. Added a ConcurrentHashMap in HoodieDataBlock to hold schema string to schema object mapping\n2. In HoodieHFileDataBlock and HoodieAvroDataBlock, use the above map to retrive the schema object rather than parsing the schema every time.\n\nAlso introduced some try { } blocks in code to auto close resources which were being leaked.\n\n### Impact\n\nWhen reading log files with a very large number of log blocks, there is reduced memory consumption.\n\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\n\nNone\n\n### Documentation Update\n\nNone\n\n### Contributor's checklist\n\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\n- [ ] CI passed\n","created_at":"2023-04-18T06:06:27Z","updated_at":"2023-04-22T08:35:58Z","closed_at":"2023-04-22T08:35:58Z","merged_at":"2023-04-22T08:35:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"09a7953f12535be9be746809fb79fd5f23df083f","assignee":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719804076,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODA0MDc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:minor","name":"priority:minor","color":"FEF2C0","default":false,"description":"everything

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the support of running bundle validation with Spark on Java 11 and 17 runtime in Github Actions.  The following changes are made.\r\n- Moves the `Dockerfile` for building `apachehudi/hudi-ci-bundle-validation-base` to `base/` and revises it to install `openjdk11` and `openjdk17`;\r\n- Adds scripts to build new images (`hudi-ci-bundle-validation-base`) for the following tags: `flink1136hive313spark313`, `flink1146hive313spark323`, `flink1153hive313spark331` (the images have been pushed to DockerHub);\r\n- Adds `base-dev/Dockerfile` for faster development locally;\r\n- Changes the `validate.sh` script to allow running bundle validation on specified Java runtime (Java 11/17), by changing `JAVA_HOME` to the corresponding version;\r\n- Changes the `ci_run.sh` to pass in specified Java runtime version;\r\n- Adds steps in `validate-bundles` in `.github/workflows/bot.yml` to run bundle validation on Java 11 (Spark 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3) and 17 (Spark 3.3).\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nCertifies that Hudi bundles with Spark run on Java 11 and 17 runtime without any issues.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nAdds `README.md` for building and uploading bundle image.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-17T20:58:58Z","updated_at":"2023-04-21T18:16:48Z","closed_at":"2023-04-21T18:16:48Z","merged_at":"2023-04-21T18:16:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"dc074666718f647cae48c7337e141cbfd446ee46","assignee":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719821152,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODIxMTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/spark","name":"spark","color":"D9974C","default":false,"description":"Issues

fixes `StreamReadMonitoringFunction` when these 3 interface functions are invoked such that `(2) snapshotState` is able to save the correct `issuedInstant` into Flink's  state before
