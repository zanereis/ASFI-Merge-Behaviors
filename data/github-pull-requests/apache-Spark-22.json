Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSome `SQLMetrics` set the initial value to `-1`, so that we can recognize no-update metrics (e.g. there is no input data and the metric is not updated at all) and filter them out later in the UI.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a bug here. Spark turns accumulator updates into `AccumulableInfo`, using `AccumulatorV2#value`. To avoid exposing the internal `-1` value to end users, `SQLMetric#value` turns `-1` into `0` before returning the value. See more details in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39311 . UI can no longer see `-1` and filter them out.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug by using the raw value of `SQLMetric` to create `AccumulableInfo`, so that UI can still see `-1` and filters it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo avoid getting the wrong min value for certain SQL metrics when some partitions have no data.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, if people write spark listeners to watch the `SparkListenerExecutorMetricsUpdate` event, they can see the correct value of SQL metrics.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nmanual UI tests. We do not have an end-to-end UI test framework for SQL metrics yet.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `UnsafeRow` change was introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47310, guarded by a SQL flag. However, I found it may be dangerous to control the behavior globally with the flag. Some code depends on the result being `GenericInternalRow` rather than `UnsafeRow` because `UnsafeRow` doesn't support the `update` method.\r\n\r\nI choose to add it to the JSON options so that the user can have more granular control over the behavior. For example, even if the user doesn't need `update`, using `UnsafeRow` may still have some performance cost according to the last PR. With the new JSON option, the user can enable it only on the JSON tables that have more memory pressure.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt reduces the memory requirement of JSON-related query.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. It introduces a new JSON option.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-08-13T17:10:11Z","updated_at":"2024-08-16T08:12:19Z","closed_at":"2024-08-16T08:12:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"444be9a810632d34e127aaf6b868a8e89a343af2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR changes to use `taskDyn` to dynamically define `task` based on the value of `moduleName.value.contains(\"assembly\")` in order to fix compilation warnings:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[warn] /home/runner/work/spark/spark/project/SparkBuild.scala:1554:77: value lookup of `/` inside an `if` expression\r\n[warn] \r\n[warn] problem: `/.value` is inside an `if` expression of a regular task.\r\n[warn]   Regular tasks always evaluate task dependencies (`.value`) regardless of `if` expressions.\r\n[warn] solution:\r\n[warn]   1. Use a conditional task `Def.taskIf(...)` to evaluate it when the `if` predicate is true or false.\r\n[warn]   2. Or turn the task body into a single `if` expression; the task is then auto-converted to a conditional task. \r\n[warn]   3. Or make the static evaluation explicit by declaring `/.value` outside the `if` expression.\r\n[warn]   4. If you still want to force the static lookup, you may annotate the task lookup with `@sbtUnchecked`, e.g. `(/.value: @sbtUnchecked)`.\r\n[warn]   5. Add `import sbt.dsl.LinterLevel.Ignore` to your build file to disable all task linting.\r\n[warn]     \r\n[warn]         val replClasspathes = (LocalProject(\"connect-client-jvm\") / Compile /

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to support separate buffer size configuration in UnsafeShuffleWriter.\r\n\r\nIntroduce `spark.shuffle.file.merge.buffer` configuration.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`UnsafeShuffleWriter#mergeSpillsWithFileStream` uses `spark.shuffle.file.buffer` as the buffer for reading spill files, and this buffer is an off-heap buffer.\r\n\r\nIn the spill process, we hope that the buffer size is larger, but once there are too many files in the spill, `UnsafeShuffleWriter#mergeSpillsWithFileStream` needs to create a lot of off-heap memory, which makes the executor easily killed by YARN.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e72d21c299a450e48b3cf6e5d36b8f3e9a568088/core/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/shuffle/sort/UnsafeShuffleWriter.java#L372-L375\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nTo use structured logging developers usually do\r\n```scala\r\nlogInfo(log\"Lost executor ${MDC(LogKeys.EXECUTOR_ID, \"1\")}.\"),\r\n```\r\nWhen the structured logging conf is off, the context is not logged.\r\nHowever if explicitly constructing the LogEntry and calling the public API,\r\n```scala\r\nlogInfo(\r\n  MessageWithContext(\r\n    \"Lost executor 1.\",\r\n    new java.util.HashMap[String, String] { put(LogKeys.EXECUTOR_ID.name, \"1\") }\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n```\r\nthe conf does not take effect and even when it is off, the context is still logged.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a fix for both cases to observe the conf, by toggling in the `withLogContext` function.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a extra small test on explicitly setting MDC.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo keep consistency between APIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nV2SessionCatalog should use V2Command when possible.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is because the session catalog can be overwritten thus the overwritten's catalog should use v2 commands, otherwise the V1Command will still call hive metastore or the built-in session catalog.\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nV2 Catalog can also support built-in data sources.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nV2 catalog could still support spark built-in data sources if the V2 catalog returns v1 table and do not track partitions in catalog. This is because we do not need to require V2 catalog to implement every thing to support built-in data sources (as that is a big chunk of work).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSome `SQLMetrics` set the initial value to `-1`, so that we can recognize no-update metrics (e.g. there is no input data and the metric is not updated at all) and filter them out later in the UI.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a bug here. Spark turns accumulator updates into `AccumulableInfo`, using `AccumulatorV2#value`. To avoid exposing the internal `-1` value to end users, `SQLMetric#value` turns `-1` into `0` before returning the value. See more details in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39311 . UI can no longer see `-1` and filter them out.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug by using the raw value of `SQLMetric` to create `AccumulableInfo`, so that UI can still see `-1` and filters it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo avoid getting the wrong min value for certain SQL metrics when some partitions have no data.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, if people write spark listeners to watch the `SparkListenerExecutorMetricsUpdate` event, they can see the correct value of SQL metrics.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nmanual UI tests. We do not have an end-to-end UI test framework for SQL metrics yet.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr change the test case `EXEC IMMEDIATE STACK OVERFLOW` in `ExecuteImmediateEndToEndSuite` to check existing exception. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore this pr:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e3ba74b65b9d534655fbcf40bb2c00b7f5c69418/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/ExecuteImmediateEndToEndSuite.scala#L44-L60\r\n\r\nThe test case intercepts an exception on lines 48 to 50, but the `exception` used in `checkError` is not related to the previously intercepted exception. Moreover, although the test is looped twice, the two `checkError` calls are actually checking the same SQL scenario, which appears to be a coding error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, just for test\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub Action\r\n- locally test\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean install -pl sql/core -am -Dtest=none

this pull request?\r\nFix the following string expressions to handle one-to-many case mapping properly:\r\n\r\n- SplitPart\r\n- StringSplitSQL\r\n\r\nExamples of incorrect results (under `UTF8_LCASE` collation):\r\n\r\n```\r\nSplitPart(\"Ai\\u0307B\", \"İ\", 2) // returns: \"\\u0307B\" (incorrect), instead of: \"B\" (correct)\r\nSplitPart(\"AİB\", \"i\\u0307\", 1) // returns: \"AİB\", instead of: \"A\", \"B\" (correct)\r\n\r\nStringSplitSQL(\"Ai\\u0307B\", \"İ\") // returns: [\"A\", \"\\u0307B\"] (incorrect), instead of: [\"A\", \"B\"] (correct)\r\nStringSplitSQL(\"AİB\", \"i\\u0307\") // returns: [\"AİB\"] (incorrect), instead of: [\"A\", \"B\"] (correct)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, some string expressions are giving wrong results when working with one-to-many case mapping.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this expression will now work properly with surrogate pairs: `split_part`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests in `CollationSupportSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nYes.\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-12T07:48:35Z","updated_at":"2024-08-13T15:45:32Z","closed_at":"2024-08-13T15:45:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"de9fa3be90d6345d9ea421b184fb9cf4dfc892b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47715/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47715/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47715/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/097cf81c1e81278b738475e60423d6938fc9786c","head":{"label":"uros-db:fix-splitpart","ref":"fix-splitpart","sha":"097cf81c1e81278b738475e60423d6938fc9786c","user":{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":755209418,"node_id":"R_kgDOLQOUyg","name":"spark","full_name":"uros-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix the following string expression to handle surrogate pairs properly:\r\n\r\n- StringTrim\r\n- StringTrimLeft\r\n- StringTrimRight\r\n\r\nThe issue has to do with counting surrogate pairs, which are single Unicode code points (and single UTF-8 characters), but are represented using 2 characters in UTF-16 (Java String).\r\n\r\nExample of incorrect results (under `UNICODE` collation, but similar issues are noted for all ICU collations):\r\n\r\n```\r\nStringTrim(\"😄\", \"😄\") // returns: \"😄\" (incorrect), instead of: \"\" (correct)\r\nStringTrimLeft(\"😄\", \"😄\") // returns: \"😄\" (incorrect), instead of: \"\" (correct)\r\nStringTrimRight(\"😄\", \"😄\") // returns: \"😄\" (incorrect), instead of: \"\" (correct)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, some string expressions are giving wrong results when working with surrogate pairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, these expressions will now work properly with surrogate pairs: `trim`/`ltrim`/`rtrim`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests in `CollationSupportSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

this pull request?\r\nFix the following string expression to handle surrogate pairs properly:\r\n\r\n- SubstringIndex\r\n\r\nThe issue has to do with counting surrogate pairs, which are single Unicode code points (and single UTF-8 characters), but are represented using 2 characters in UTF-16 (Java String).\r\n\r\nExample of incorrect result (under `UNICODE` collation, but similar issues are noted for all ICU collations):\r\n\r\n```\r\nSubstringIndex(\"😄a\", \"a\") // returns: \"😄a\" (incorrect), instead of: \"😄\" (correct)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, some string expressions are giving wrong results when working with surrogate pairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this expression will now work properly with surrogate pairs: `substr_index`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests in `CollationSupportSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix the following string expressions to handle surrogate pairs properly:\r\n\r\n- StringInstr\r\n- StringLocate\r\n\r\nThe issue has to do with counting surrogate pairs, which are single Unicode code points (and single UTF-8 characters), but are represented using 2 characters in UTF-16 (Java String).\r\n\r\nExample of incorrect results (under `UNICODE` collation, but similar issues are noted for all ICU collations):\r\n\r\n```\r\nStringInstr(\"😄a\", \"a\") // returns: 3 (incorrect), instead of: 2 (correct)\r\nStringLocate(\"a\", \"😄a\") // returns: 3 (incorrect), instead of: 2 (correct)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, some string expressions are giving wrong results when working with surrogate pairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, these expressions will now work properly with surrogate pairs: `instr`, `locate`/`position`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests in `CollationSupportSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix the following string expression to handle surrogate pairs properly:\r\n\r\n- StringRepeat\r\n\r\nThe issue has to do with counting surrogate pairs, which are single Unicode code points (and single UTF-8 characters), but are represented using 2 characters in UTF-16 (Java String).\r\n\r\nExample of incorrect result (under `UNICODE` collation, but similar issues are noted for all ICU collations):\r\n\r\n```\r\nStringReplace(\"😄a\", \"a\", \"b\") // returns: \"😄ab\" (incorrect), instead of: \"😄b\" (correct)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, some string expressions are giving wrong results when working with surrogate pairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this expression will now work properly with surrogate pairs: `repeat`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests in `CollationSupportSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix the following string expressions to handle surrogate pairs properly:\r\n\r\n- StringRepeat\r\n- SubstringIndex\r\n- StringLocate\r\n- StringInstr\r\n- StringTrim\r\n\r\nThe issue has to do with counting surrogate pairs, which are single Unicode code points (and single UTF-8 characters), but are represented using 2 characters in UTF-16 (Java String).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, some string expressions are giving wrong results when working with surrogate pairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, these expressions will now work properly with surrogate pairs: `repeat`, `substr_index`, `locate`/`position`, `instr`, `trim`/`ltrim`/`rtrim`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests in `CollationSupportSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR modifies the `mvn` command detection logic in `build/mvn`, to check project local installed `build/apache-maven-${MVN_VERSION}/bin/mvn` ahead to avoid unnecessary network accessing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo speed up `build/mvn` bootstrap time.\r\n\r\nI found sometimes `build/mvn -version` is pretty slow even `build/apache-maven-${MVN_VERSION}` is already cached, and I found it may stuck at the following call when network quality is not good.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/879924491944be5d022df895b947bcee25837cc0/build/mvn#L129\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTested `build/mvn -version` in the following cases:\r\n1. when `build/apache-maven-${MVN_VERSION}/bin/mvn` is available, the command always finishes quickly.\r\n2. when `build/apache-maven-${MVN_VERSION}/bin/mvn` is unavailable but global installed `mvn` version matches `maven.version` defined in root `pom.xml`, the command always finishes quickly too.\r\n3. otherwise, it automatically downloads the maven binary tarball from network.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR propose to specify `includeScope=runtime` for `copy-dependencies` to prune unrelated jars out. In addition, this Pr has a couple of more improvement by replacing `org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin` to `org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin` for `get-ammonite-jar` and `get-ammonite-pom` which avoid directly calling `mvn` executable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo reduce the number of jars (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47402#issuecomment-2277042654) \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo the main change (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47402) has not been released out yet.\r\nBut it will reduce the size of the jars in the package.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./build/mvn -Phive -DskipTests clean package\r\ncd assembly/target/scala-2.13/jars/connect-repl/\r\nls -al | wc -l\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces the following optimization to the `Row#getSeq` function: \r\n\r\n- When the actual type of `Seq` is `mutable.ArraySeq[T]`, it rewraps the `mutable.ArraySeq.array` as an `immutable.ArraySeq[T]` to avoid a collection copy. \r\n\r\nThis optimization make the performance of `Row#getSeq` in master to match the performance when using Spark 3.5 with Scala 2.12.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOptimize the performance of `Row#getSeq` to match the performance when using Spark 3.5 with Scala 2.12.\r\n\r\nConsider the following scenario:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n    val data = (0 until arraySize).toArray\r\n    val row = Seq(data).toDF().collect().head\r\n\r\n    val benchmark = new Benchmark(\r\n      s\"Test get seq with $arraySize from row\",\r\n      valuesPerIteration,\r\n      output = output)\r\n\r\n    benchmark.addCase(\"Get Seq\") { _: Int =>\r\n\r\n      for (_ <- 0L until valuesPerIteration) {\r\n        val ret = row.getSeq(0)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    benchmark.run()\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun tests on the aforementioned code with `arraySize` set to 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000, respectively, and with `valuesPerIteration` set to 100000, getting the following results:\r\n\r\n- branch-3.5(with Scala 2.12):\r\n\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_422-b05 on Linux 5.15.0-1068-azure\r\nAMD

the latency of `Row#getSeq` exhibits a linearly increasing trend with the length of the array.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the following code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c121bb557447709c19fc01b68b3a34b8838abc6d/sql/api/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/Row.scala#L317-L325\r\n\r\nThe default Scala version in branch-3.5 is 2.12, where `Seq` represents `scala.collection.Seq`. Therefore, the `res.toSeq` in the code above is a redundant operation that does not trigger a collection copy.\r\n\r\nHowever, the default Scala version in master is 2.13, where `Seq` represents `scala.collection.immutable.Seq`, and `getAs[scala.collection.Seq[T]](i)` returns a `scala.collection.mutable.ArraySeq[T]` type. As a result, the `res.toSeq` in the code above triggers a collection copy from `mutable.ArraySeq[T]` to `immutable.ArraySeq[T]`.\r\n\r\nThis has caused a performance regression for the `Row#getSeq` API between master and Spark 3.5 with Scala 2.12\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n- Test the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `SPARK_EXECUTOR_ATTRIBUTE_(APP|EXECUTOR)_ID` if `CUSTOM_EXECUTOR_LOG_URL` is defined.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nApache Spark has been supported `spark.ui.custom.executor.log.url` in K8s environment well.\r\n\r\n- #47681\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to help users use it more easily by providing the required `SPARK_EXECUTOR_ATTRIBUTE_APP_ID` and `SPARK_EXECUTOR_ATTRIBUTE_EXECUTOR_ID` automatically if `spark.ui.custom.executor.log.url` is defined.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n- No by default because `spark.ui.custom.executor.log.url` is not used.\r\n- When `spark.ui.custom.executor.log.url` is used, \r\n    - For YARN users, there is no change for YARN users because this is K8s only change.\r\n    - For K8s users, this will reduce the existing steps by providing the same environment variables. In addition, the user variables always overwrite this built-in environment variables by design.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFollow up to SPARK-49114 (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47616). The PR added sub-categories of \"cannot load state store errors\", but it missed to add definition of error class into `error-conditions.json` JSON file.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nNewly added error classes from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47616 will be dangling ones without this PR.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR makes the org.apache.spark.sql.Column and friends use the recently introduced ColumnNode API. This is a stepping stone towards making the Column API implementation agnostic.\r\n\r\nMost of the changes are fairly mechanical, and they are mostly caused by the removal of the Column(Expression) constructor.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want to create unified Scala interface for Classic and Connect. A language agnostic Column API implementation is part of this.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nEven if the table definition has a location, the table should be a managed table if `PROP_IS_MANAGED_LOCATION` is specified, in `V2SessionCatalog.createTable`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's a bug fix. A custom `spark_catalog` may generate custom location for managed table and delegate the actual table creation to `V2SessionCatalog`. The table should still be a managed table if `PROP_IS_MANAGED_LOCATION` is specified.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now users who use custom `spark_catalog` that generates custom location for managed table, can correctly create managed tables.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\na new test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to make GA's `build_error_docs` run only `once`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- At present, from observing the logs of `GA`, we have found that `build_error_docs` has run `twice`, which is `unnecessary`, as follows:\r\n  <img width=\"998\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c60a77e3-4589-45b0-996a-dc848c1b8c7f\">\r\n\r\n- Additionally, in step `Run documentation build` of `GA`, some environment variables (eg: `SKIP_PYTHONDOC`, `SKIP_RDOC`) are dynamic. I propose printing their values before executing `bundle exec jekyll build` to facilitate developer debugging.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `spark.ui.custom.executor.log.url` configuration's documentation by adding K8s on top of YARN.\r\n```\r\n-    For now, only YARN mode supports this configuration\r\n+    For now, only YARN and K8s cluster manager supports this configuration\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, K8s example is added to `running-on-kubernetes.md` docs

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRefine the type hints in functions' signatures:\r\n\r\n- `Dict` -> `Mapping`\r\n- `List` -> `Sequence`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`Dict` and `List` are mutable and invariant, and [python reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#aliases-to-built-in-types) suggests:\r\n\r\n> Note that to annotate arguments, it is preferred to use an abstract collection type such as [Mapping](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Mapping) rather than to use [dict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict) or typing.Dict.\r\n\r\n> Note that to annotate arguments, it is preferred to use an abstract collection type such as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for [case statements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uFv2VoqDoOH2k6HfgdkBYxp-Ou7Qi721eexNW6IYWwk/edit?usp=sharing) to sql scripting. There are 2 types of case statement - simple and searched (EXAMPLES BELOW). Proposed changes are:\r\n\r\n- Add `caseStatement` grammar rule to SqlBaseParser.g4\r\n- Add visit case statement methods to `AstBuilder`\r\n- Add `SearchedCaseStatement` and `SearchedCaseStatementExec` classes, to enable them to be run in sql scripts.\r\n\r\nThe reason only searched case nodes are added is that, in the current implementation, a simple case is parsed into a searched case, by creating internal `EqualTo` expressions to compare the main case expression to the expressions in the when clauses. This approach is similar to the existing case **expressions**, which are parsed in the same way. The problem with this approach is that the main expression is unnecessarily evaluated N times, where N is the number of when clauses, which can be quite inefficient, for example if the expression is a complex query. Optimally, the main expression would be evaluated once, and then compared to the other expressions. I'm open to suggestions as to what the best approach to achieve this would be.\r\n\r\nSimple case compares one expression (case variable) to others, until an equal one is found. Else clause is optional.\r\n```\r\nBEGIN\r\n  CASE 1\r\n    WHEN 1 THEN\r\n      SELECT 1;\r\n    WHEN 2 THEN\r\n      SELECT 2;\r\n    ELSE\r\n      SELECT 3;\r\n  END CASE;\r\nEND\r\n```\r\n\r\nSearched case evaluates boolean expressions. Else clause is optional.\r\n```\r\nBEGIN\r\n  CASE\r\n    WHEN 1 = 1 THEN\r\n      SELECT 1;\r\n    WHEN 2 IN (1,2,3) THEN\r\n      SELECT 2;\r\n    ELSE\r\n      SELECT 3;\r\n  END CASE;\r\nEND\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCase statements are currently not implemented in sql scripting.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, users will now be able to use case statements in their sql scripts.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests for both simple and searched case statements are added to SqlScriptingParserSuite, SqlScriptingExecutionNodeSuite and SqlScriptingInterpreterSuite.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-08T15:11:47Z","updated_at":"2025-01-10T15:13:23Z","closed_at":"2024-09-13T13:01:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c2bd812cf47f88995a4e2c872d680e1911188d34","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47672/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47672/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47672/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/df6765c7eb468d2090c193d6be802ed23d1bde42","head":{"label":"dusantism-db:sql-scripting-case-statement","ref":"sql-scripting-case-statement","sha":"df6765c7eb468d2090c193d6be802ed23d1bde42","user":{"login":"dusantism-db","id":176312626,"node_id":"U_kgDOCoJRMg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/176312626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db","html_url":"https://github.com/dusantism-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":834060712,"node_id":"R_kgDOMbbBqA","name":"spark","full_name":"dusantism-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dusantism-db","id":176312626,"node_id":"U_kgDOCoJRMg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/176312626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db","html_url":"https://github.com/dusantism-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dusantism-db/spark","description":"Apache

After that, try to create new table based on parquet data in Spark:\r\n```\r\ncreate table broken_table using parquet location 'some/path/parquet-test';\r\n```\r\nThis query errors with internal error. Stack trace excerpts:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: [INTERNAL_ERROR] Eagerly executed command failed. You hit a bug in Spark or the Spark plugins you use. Please, report this bug to the corresponding communities or vendors, and provide the full stack trace.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReplace internal error with user-facing one for valid sequence of Spark SQL operations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, it presents the user with regular error instead of internal error.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded checks to `ParquetPartitionDiscoverySuite` which simulate the described scenario by manually breaking parquet table in the filesystem.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn a previous commit a713a66e, log level in the connect client\r\nwas lowered from info to debug. As part of that, the explicit\r\ncheck for logging level was removed.\r\n\r\nRevert this change and put the logging level check back.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe explicit check was there so as to not convert the proto\r\nto a string, done during string interpolation, when not at the\r\nexpected log level.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe primary change in this PR is in the function `RowEncoder#encoderForDataType`, where the encoding type for `ArrayType` data has been changed from `immutable.ArraySeq[_]` to `immutable.ArraySeq[_]` in order to optimize the performance of `Row#getSeq` to match the performance when using Spark 3.5 with Scala 2.12.\r\n\r\nFollowing the modification of `RowEncoder.scala`, the data transferred between the JVM and R may now include `immutable.ArraySeq`. As a result, this pr also fix `r/SerDe.scala` to adjust to this scenario and guarantees that all existing test cases can pass successfully.\r\n\r\nThe changes to other test files are because, after this pr, Seq type data will be encoded as `immutable.ArraySeq` type, so it is necessary to use `getAs[immutable.Seq]` instead of `getAs[mutable.Seq]` to retrieve them, but if `getSeq` is used to retrieve the data, there will be no changes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOptimize the performance of `Row#getSeq` to match the performance when using Spark 3.5 with Scala 2.12.\r\n\r\nConsider the following scenario:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n    val data = (0 until arraySize).toArray\r\n    val row = Seq(data).toDF().collect().head\r\n\r\n    val benchmark = new Benchmark(\r\n      s\"Test get seq with $arraySize from row\",\r\n      valuesPerIteration,\r\n      output = output)\r\n\r\n    benchmark.addCase(\"Get Seq\") { _: Int =>\r\n\r\n      for (_ <- 0L until valuesPerIteration) {\r\n        val ret = row.getSeq(0)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    benchmark.run()\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun tests on the aforementioned code with `arraySize` set to 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000, respectively, and with `valuesPerIteration` set to 100000, getting the following results:\r\n\r\n- branch-3.5(with Scala 2.12):\r\n\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_422-b05

the latency of `Row#getSeq` exhibits a linearly increasing trend with the length of the array.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the following code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c121bb557447709c19fc01b68b3a34b8838abc6d/sql/api/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/Row.scala#L317-L325\r\n\r\nThe default Scala version in branch-3.5 is 2.12, where `Seq` represents `scala.collection.Seq`. Therefore, the `res.toSeq` in the code above is a redundant operation that does not trigger a collection copy.\r\n\r\nHowever, the default Scala version in master is 2.13, where `Seq` represents `scala.collection.immutable.Seq`, and `getAs[scala.collection.Seq[T]](i)` returns a `scala.collection.mutable.ArraySeq[T]` type. As a result, the `res.toSeq` in the code above triggers a collection copy from `mutable.ArraySeq[T]` to `immutable.ArraySeq[T]`.\r\n\r\nThis has caused a performance regression for the `Row#getSeq` API between master and Spark 3.5 with Scala 2.12\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nIf users utilize the `Row#getSeq` API to fetch data, there will be no user-facing change.\r\n\r\nHowever, if users previously used the `Row#getAs[mutable.Seq]` API to obtain data, they will need to change it to `Row#getAs[immutable.Seq]`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

processes of constructing `GenericArrayData` in Spark code:\r\n\r\n1. In `ArraysZip#eval` and `XPathList#nullSafeEval`, the originally defined arrays of specific types are changed to data of type `AnyRef` to avoid additional collection copying when constructing `GenericArrayData`. This is because the `Array[AnyRef]` type can also match the `case array: Array[Any] => array` branch in the following code:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/af70aafd330fdbb6ce0d5b3efbcb180cda488695/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/util/GenericArrayData.scala#L42-L48\r\n\r\n2. In `HistogramNumeric#eval`, an `IndexedSeq[InternalRow]` was originally used to construct `GenericArrayData`. Since the length of the collection is known, it can be refactored to use `Array[AnyRef]` to construct `GenericArrayData`.\r\n\r\n3. For other cases, when constructing `GenericArrayData`, the current input parameter is `${input}.toArray` now. It is changed to `${input}.toArray[Any]` to avoid another collection copy during the construction of `GenericArrayData`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsing an Array of `Any|AnyRef` to construct `GenericArrayData` can improve performance by reducing collection copying.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nV2SessionCatalog should use V2Command when possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is because the session catalog can be overwritten thus the overwritten's catalog should use v2 commands, otherwise the V1Command will still call hive metastore or the built-in session catalog.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTrait `org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoRegistrator` is a public interface because it is exposed via config `spark.kryo.registrator`, but it is not annotated to describe the stability level. This adds the `DeveloperApi` annotation to formalize the contract.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis will help users understand the compatibility guarantees when using the trait. It is also helpful for scripts that need to identify classes with public APIs. We recently missed this trait in a script used to analyze which namespaces can be shaded.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it adds the DeveloperApi interface to the trait.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nN/A. Annotation change only.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-07T22:21:49Z","updated_at":"2024-08-08T08:55:49Z","closed_at":"2024-08-08T08:55:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d59d4655c4f8954cf191b551c6dc00b81b743ea4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47657/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47657/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47657/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8b23c041a46c31da95175bea3a7e447ec375089f","head":{"label":"robreeves:rob/stable_kryo","ref":"rob/stable_kryo","sha":"8b23c041a46c31da95175bea3a7e447ec375089f","user":{"login":"robreeves","id":5604993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDQ5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5604993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves","html_url":"https://github.com/robreeves","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":524214006,"node_id":"R_kgDOHz7e9g","name":"spark","full_name":"robreeves/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robreeves","id":5604993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDQ5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5604993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves","html_url":"https://github.com/robreeves","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/robreeves/spark","description":"Apache

The logs followed a JSON output format which is not optimal for human consumption:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n{\"ts\":\"2024-07-26T18:45:17.712Z\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"msg\":\"Running Spark version 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT\",\"context\":{\"spark_version\":\"4.0.0-SNAPSHOT\"},\"logger\":\"SparkContext\"}{\"ts\":\"2024-07-26T18:45:17.715Z\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"msg\":\"OS info Mac OS X, 14.4.1, aarch64\",\"context\":{\"os_arch\":\"aarch64\",\"os_name\":\"Mac OS X\",\"os_version\":\"14.4.1\"},\"logger\":\"SparkContext\"}{\"ts\":\"2024-07-26T18:45:17.716Z\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"msg\":\"Java version 17.0.11\",\"context\":{\"java_version\":\"17.0.11\"},\"logger\":\"SparkContext\"}{\"ts\":\"2024-07-26T18:45:17.761Z\",\"level\":\"WARN\",\"msg\":\"Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable\",\"logger\":\"NativeCodeLoader\"}{\"ts\":\"2024-07-26T18:45:17.783Z\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"msg\":\"==============================================================\",\"logger\":\"ResourceUtils\"}{\"ts\":\"2024-07-26T18:45:17.783Z\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"msg\":\"No custom resources configured for spark.driver.\",\"logger\":\"ResourceUtils\"}{\"ts\":\"2024-07-26T18:45:17.783Z\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"msg\":\"==============================================================\",\"logger\":\"ResourceUtils\"}{\"ts\":\"2024-07-26T18:45:17.784Z\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"msg\":\"Submitted application: Spark Pi\",\"context\":{\"app_name\":\"Spark Pi\"},\"logger\":\"SparkContext\"}...{\"ts\":\"2024-07-26T18:45:18.036Z\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"msg\":\"Start Jetty 0.0.0.0:4040 for SparkUI\",\"context\":{\"host\":\"0.0.0.0\",\"port\":\"4040\",\"server_name\":\"SparkUI\"},\"logger\":\"JettyUtils\"}{\"ts\":\"2024-07-26T18:45:18.044Z\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"msg\":\"jetty-11.0.20; built: 2024-01-29T21:04:22.394Z; git: 922f8dc188f7011e60d0361de585fd4ac4d63064; jvm 17.0.11+9-LTS\",\"logger\":\"Server\"}{\"ts\":\"2024-07-26T18:45:18.054Z\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"msg\":\"Started Server@22c75c01{STARTING}[11.0.20,sto=30000] @1114ms\",\"logger\":\"Server\"} \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, please see below for the updated log output.
