What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade the NodeJS from 12 to 16, in `zeppelin-web` and `zeppelin-web-angular` modules.\r\n\r\nIn this upgrade, I try my best to minimize the changes. NodeJS 12 is a pretty old one, and NodeJS 16(it was EOL recently too[1]) was chosen as a kind of balance because this project uses some pretty old versions of dependencies. e.g. it's recommended to upgrade to webpack 6 to work with NodeJS 18[2], but Zeppelin uses webpack 3\r\n\r\n[1] https://endoflife.date/nodejs\r\n[2] https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/14532\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\n- Improvement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\nZEPPELIN-5983\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nPass CI, and manually test by randomly clicking the Web UI page to test the basic functionalities.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\nThe legacy UI\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/assets/26535726/cc6b3a0d-5ab2-40d2-b6be-e7ea979268ce)\r\n\r\nThe new UI\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/assets/26535726/e049a0fd-099a-406a-9f51-8f45407c7212)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? No \r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No \r\n* Does this needs documentation? Yes, updated

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nMerge `flink-scala-parent` module into `flink-scala-2.12` to simplify the project module structure.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Zeppelin supports Flink 1.15~1.17, these versions of Flink only support Scala 2.12(specifically, 2.12.7), and the Flink community decided to make the project scala-free instead of supporting new versions of Scala in the future;\r\n\r\nThis change also simplifies the IDEA project importing, without this change, IDEA can not recognize `flink-scala-2.12` module automatically, the developer needs to follow the README to manually fix it.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\nZEPPELIN-5982\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nPass GA\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Yes, updated the docs correspondingly\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-17T18:26:34Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T08:51:52Z","closed_at":"2023-11-20T08:51:51Z","merged_at":"2023-11-20T08:51:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"464761e3a3353b5e0291d74ec54578094a100cd9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4694/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4694/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4694/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/f371a69245350c13600945b393c1cf2d19007499","head":{"label":"pan3793:ZEPPELIN-5982","ref":"ZEPPELIN-5982","sha":"f371a69245350c13600945b393c1cf2d19007499","user":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":572618398,"node_id":"R_kgDOIiF2ng","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"pan3793/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\nInside an open zeppelin notebook, after running a paragraph by clicking the play icon button, canceling the running paragraph by clicking the pause icon button (or the Ctrl+Option+C shortcut) does not interrupt the running process and cancel the paragraph.\r\n\r\nI've checked that `CANCEL_PARAGRAPH` message gets well passed through the websocket connection but server was somehow completely ignoring the message.\r\n\r\nAfter some more investigation, I've found that the reason for that was the `Paragraph`'s `jobAbort()` method, which does nothing due to the null interpreter member.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/73e1aa37d403626d23138b3b346aec5ef2c12813/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/notebook/Paragraph.java#L505\r\n\r\nI've checked some other methods of `Paragraph` such as `completion()`, `execute()`, `jobRun()`, `recover()` and they were initializing interpreter before doing something by calling `getBindedInterpreter()`, so I've changed the `jobAbort()` method to do the same.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/73e1aa37d403626d23138b3b346aec5ef2c12813/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/notebook/Paragraph.java#L258\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/73e1aa37d403626d23138b3b346aec5ef2c12813/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/notebook/Paragraph.java#L333\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/73e1aa37d403626d23138b3b346aec5ef2c12813/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/notebook/Paragraph.java#L399\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/73e1aa37d403626d23138b3b346aec5ef2c12813/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/notebook/Paragraph.java#L810\r\n\r\nOther than that, I have some doubts on whether it's right thing to return true on failing what was requested.\r\n\r\nBut after all, I just sticked to the original behavior (returning true for every case) to prevent some unexpected side effects.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5981\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Run a paragraph that can be canceled, like a python interpreter paragraph with `for i in range(10): time.sleep(1)`\r\n* Click the cancel button and check if it gets canceled .\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-17T12:18:33Z","updated_at":"2024-02-05T12:47:31Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"581cd9dcce78b2021f97283708c6b58c8ef911db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4693/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4693/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4693/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/812a4481050548d6d11af4f7c991c6f2670103ec","head":{"label":"elbakramer:fix/cancel-paragraph","ref":"fix/cancel-paragraph","sha":"812a4481050548d6d11af4f7c991c6f2670103ec","user":{"login":"elbakramer","id":12024377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI0Mzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12024377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer","html_url":"https://github.com/elbakramer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":281656866,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODE2NTY4NjY=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"elbakramer/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"elbakramer","id":12024377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI0Mzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12024377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer","html_url":"https://github.com/elbakramer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbakramer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/elbakramer/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4674.\r\n\r\nThis PR aligns Hadoop dependencies version (3.3.6) in all Zeppelin modules, additionally, it switches to Hadoop shaded client (introduced in HADOOP-11804 since Hadoop 3.0.0) which is recommended by Hadoop, Spark also switched to Hadoop shaded client in SPARK-33212 (3.2.0), which dramatically reduce the Hadoop dependency management efforts, basically, only 3 hadoop jars are required now:\r\n- `hadoop-client-api`\r\n- `hadoop-client-runtime`\r\n- `hadoop-client-minicluster` (only for testing)\r\n\r\nThere is a JDK 10 compatible issue fixed in HIVE-21508 (Hive 2.3.7), so this PR also upgrades Flink's Hive version from 2.3.4 to 2.3.7.

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove the support for old Flink 1.13 and 1.14.\r\n\r\nThe current [Flink Download Page](https://flink.apache.org/downloads) only lists 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, and the community is discussing the [final release of 1.16 called 1.16.3](https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@flink.apache.org/msg71005.html)\r\n\r\nAlso, there are major differences in the implementation at the Zeppelin side for Flink prior to 1.15 and later versions. Thus, I suggest removing the support for old Flink 1.13 and 1.14 at this time.\r\n\r\nNote: this PR focuses on build and docs changes, we can do code cleanup in the following PRs, e.g.\r\n- merge the `flink-scala-2.12` and `flink-scala-parents` since Flink community decided to make the project scala-free instead of supporting new versions of scala in the future; \r\n- remove code for earlier versions of flink\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\nZEPPELIN-5978\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nPass GA\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? Yes, it removes the support for some old versions of Flink\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Updated

[lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) from 3.9.3 to 4.17.21.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/lodash/lodash/releases\">lodash's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>4.0.0</h2>\n<h1><a href=\"https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400\">lodash v4.0.0</a></h1>\n<p>2015 was big year! <a href=\"https://lodash.com/\">Lodash</a> became the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/anvaka/8e8fa57c7ee1350e3491#file-01-most-dependent-upon-md\">most depended on</a> npm package, passed <a href=\"http://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=&amp;author=jdalton\">1 billion</a> downloads, &amp; its v3 release saw massive adoption!</p>\n<p>The year was also one of collaboration, as discussions began on <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/underdash/underdash/issues/14\">merging Lodash &amp; Underscore</a>. Much of Lodash v4 is proofing out the ideas from those discussions. Lodash v4 <strong>would not be possible</strong> without the collaboration &amp; contributions of the Underscore core team. In the spirit of merging our teams have blended with <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/lodash/people\">several members</a> contributing to both libraries.</p>\n<p>For 2016 &amp; <a href=\"https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400\">lodash v4.0.0</a> we wanted to cut loose, push forward, &amp; take things up a notch!</p>\n<h2>Modern only</h2>\n<p>With v4 we’re breaking free from <a href=\"https://github.com/lodash-archive\">old projects</a>, old environments, &amp; dropping <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support\">old IE &lt; 9 support</a>!</p>\n<h2>4 kB Core</h2>\n<p>Lodash’s kitchen-sink size will continue to grow as new methods &amp; functionality are added. However, we now offer a 4 kB (gzipped) <a href=\"https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0/dist\">core build</a> that’s compatible with <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/3839\">Backbone v1.2.4</a> for folks who want Lodash without lugging around the kitchen sink.</p>\n<h2>More ES6</h2>\n<p>We’ve continued to embrace ES6 with methods like <a href=\"https://lodash.com/docs#isSymbol\">_.isSymbol</a>, added support for cloning &amp; comparing array buffers, maps, sets, &amp; symbols, converting iterators to arrays, &amp; iterable <code>_(…)</code>.</p>\n<p>In addition, we’ve published an <a href=\"https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0-es/\">es-build</a> &amp; pulled <a href=\"https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash\">babel-plugin-lodash</a> into core to make tree-shaking a breeze.</p>\n<h2>More Modular</h2>\n<p>Pop quiz! 📣</p>\n<p>What category path does the <code>bindAll</code> method belong to? Is it</p>\n<p>A) <code>require('lodash/function/bindAll')</code>\nB) <code>require('lodash/utility/bindAll')</code>\nC) <code>require('lodash/util/bindAll')</code></p>\n<p>Don’t know? Well, with v4 it doesn’t matter because now module paths are as simple as</p>\n<pre lang=\"js\"><code>var bindAll = require('lodash/bindAll');\n</code></pre>\n<p>We’ve also reduced module complexity making it easier to create smaller bundles. This has helped Lodash adoption with libraries like <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/caolan/async/pull/996\">Async</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rackt/redux/pull/611\">Redux</a>!</p>\n<h2>1st Class FP</h2>\n<p>With v3 we introduced <a href=\"https://github.com/lodash-archive/lodash-fp\">lodash-fp</a>. We learned a lot &amp; with v4 we decided to <a href=\"https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide\">pull it into core</a>.</p>\n<p>Now you can get immutable, auto-curried, iteratee-first, data-last methods as simply as</p>\n<pre lang=\"js\"><code>var _ = require('lodash/fp');\nvar object = { 'a': 1 };\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

The ping functionality by default responds with a pong frame and the previously given payload of the ping frame. This is exactly what you expect, but internally we always transform all data that we need to send to a <code>Buffer</code> instance and this is where the problem was. We didn't do any checks for the type of data we were sending. With buffers in node when you allocate it when a number instead of a string it will allocate the amount of bytes.</p>\n<pre lang=\"js\"><code>var x = new Buffer(100);\n// vs\nvar x = new Buffer('100');\n</code></pre>\n<p>This would allocate 100 bytes of memory in the first example and just 3 bytes with <code>100</code> as value in the second example. So when the server would receive a ping message of <code>1000</code> it would allocate 1000 bytes on the server and returned non-zeroed buffer to the client instead of the actual <code>100</code> message.</p>\n<pre lang=\"js\"><code>var ws = require('ws')\n<p>var server = new ws.Server({ port: 9000 })\nvar client = new ws('ws://localhost:9000')</p>\n<p>client.on('open', function () {\nconsole.log('open')\nclient.ping(50) // this makes the server return a non-zeroed buffer of 50 bytes</p>\n<p>client.on('pong', function (data) {\nconsole.log('got pong')\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

What is this PR for?\r\nRemove deprecated bower. As the \"bower\" says, recommended using a different system. So it looks good to remove bower. Replace bower by npm.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Bower's dependencies are resolved by npm\r\n* [x] - Minor dependency versions may have been changed to resolved by npm\r\n* [x] - Integrate new dependencies to front-end and testing\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5792\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Run npm commands\r\n* Run Karma tests\r\n* Manual front-end testing\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? Maybe because of library version change\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-17T13:40:11Z","updated_at":"2023-09-25T07:33:04Z","closed_at":"2023-09-25T07:33:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"836aa53c2e75eb2757a865eb88b12f8d32adc507","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4633/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4633/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4633/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/c11456b60ce45ff010657a1b6fd0b5d4a8aa91c8","head":{"label":"holodazoltan:ZEPPELIN-5792","ref":"ZEPPELIN-5792","sha":"c11456b60ce45ff010657a1b6fd0b5d4a8aa91c8","user":{"login":"holodazoltan","id":6303363,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDMzNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6303363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan","html_url":"https://github.com/holodazoltan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":667426419,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ8gecw","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"holodazoltan/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"holodazoltan","id":6303363,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDMzNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6303363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan","html_url":"https://github.com/holodazoltan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holodazoltan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/holodazoltan/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\nUsers who are able to see notes in some directory can rename, move to trash and remove from trash that directory without being owner or having write permissions for notes in that directory.\r\nThis is resolved in first commit.\r\n\r\nSecondly, after renaming directory to the name of already existing directory, old notes in target directory become unaccessible (in fact those notes are removed in file system, but still visible in UI as they are present in NoteManager registry).\r\nThis addresses 2nd point in ZEPPELIN-5333.\r\nFixed in 2nd commit.\r\n\r\n### What type

[ZEPPELIN-5333.](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5333.)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* I've tested this manually by creating some note in directory, giving read permission to it for some other user, and checking whether that user can move to trash, remove, rename or restore directory with that note.\r\n* I've checked and it does not seem like there are available infrastructure in `NotebookServiceTest` or in `NoteManagerTest` to cover multi-user

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR addresses all comments from the following comment. https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/6592#issuecomment-897877018\r\n\r\nThe comments were very helpful to do a better configuration in the code.\r\n\r\nEspecially `server.setDumpAfterStart(true);` helped to get a good overview. Since the dump is quite long and only helpful for debugging, I added it temporarily during development. However, due to its great usefulness, the command should not go unmentioned.\r\n\r\nDuring development, I made sure that we did not use any special Jersey functions to simplify possible portability.\r\n```\r\npackages(\"org.apache.zeppelin.rest\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince I forgot to include the Session API during development, I added a simple test class.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we currently expose the API and various other endpoints (e.g. Prometheus, Ping, Health) on two endpoints with appropriate configuration.\r\nFor the API endpoint once under `/api/` and once under `/next/api/`.\r\n\r\nI don't think this will cause any problems.\r\n\r\nMy goal is that Jetty can be upgraded to more current versions with it.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n* Improvement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5933\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* CI\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

In response, we've reimplemented the method (and the very rarely used <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> class, which had a similar issue) to eliminate the insecure behavior entirely. This change could technically affect users in a number of different ways (discussed under &quot;Incompatible changes&quot; below), but in practice, the only problem users are likely to encounter is with Windows. If you are using those APIs under Windows, you should skip 32.0.0 and go straight to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a> which fixes the problem. (Unfortunately, we didn't think of the Windows problem until after the release. And while we <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava#important-warnings\">warn that <code>common.io</code> in particular may not work under Windows</a>, we didn't intend to regress support.) Sorry for the trouble.</p>\n<h4>Incompatible changes</h4>\n<p>Although this release bumps Guava's major version number, it makes <strong>no binary-incompatible changes to the <code>guava</code> artifact</strong>.</p>\n<p>One change could cause issues for Widows users, and a few other changes could cause issues for users in more usual situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The new implementations of <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6535\">throw an exception under Windows</a>.</strong> This is fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a>. Sorry for the trouble.</li>\n<li>This release makes a binary-incompatible change to a <code>@Beta</code> API in the <strong>separate artifact</strong> <code>guava-testlib</code>. Specifically, we changed the return type of <code>TestingExecutors.sameThreadScheduledExecutor</code> to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. The old return type was a package-private class, which caused the Kotlin compiler to produce warnings. (dafaa3e435)</li>\n<li>This release <em>adds</em> two methods to the Android flavor of Guava: <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. Those methods do not work under an Android VM; we added them only to help our tests of the Android flavor (since we also run those tests under a JRE). Android VMs tolerate such methods as long as the app does not call them or perform reflection on them, and builds tolerate them because of our new Proguard configurations (discussed below). Thus, we expect no impact to most users. However, we could imagine build problems for users who have set up their own build system for the Android flavor of Guava. Please report any problems so that we can judge how safely we might be able to add other methods to the Android flavor in the future, such as APIs that use Java 8 classes like <code>Stream</code>.

And while we <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava#important-warnings\">warn that <code>common.io</code> in particular may not work under Windows</a>, we didn't intend to regress support.) Sorry for the trouble.</p>\n<h4>Incompatible changes</h4>\n<p>Although this release bumps Guava's major version number, it makes <strong>no binary-incompatible changes to the <code>guava</code> artifact</strong>.</p>\n<p>One change could cause issues for Widows users, and a few other changes could cause issues for users in more usual situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The new implementations of <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6535\">throw an exception under Windows</a>.</strong> This is fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a>. Sorry for the trouble.</li>\n<li>This release makes a binary-incompatible change to a <code>@Beta</code> API in the <strong>separate artifact</strong> <code>guava-testlib</code>. Specifically, we changed the return type of <code>TestingExecutors.sameThreadScheduledExecutor</code> to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. The old return type was a package-private class, which caused the Kotlin compiler to produce warnings. (dafaa3e435)</li>\n<li>This release <em>adds</em> two methods to the Android flavor of Guava: <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. Those methods do not work under an Android VM; we added them only to help our tests of the Android flavor (since we also run those tests under a JRE). Android VMs tolerate such methods as long as the app does not call them or perform reflection on them, and builds tolerate them because of our new Proguard configurations (discussed below). Thus, we expect no impact to most users. However, we could imagine build problems for users who have set up their own build system for the Android flavor of Guava. Please report any problems so that we can judge how safely we might be able to add other methods to the Android flavor in the future, such as APIs that use Java 8 classes like <code>Stream</code>.

(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/2575\">#2575</a>). (feb83a1c8f)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While CVE-2020-8908 was officially closed when we deprecated <code>Files.createTempDir</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v30.0\">Guava 30.0</a>, we've heard from users that even recent versions of Guava have been listed as vulnerable in <em>other</em> databases of security vulnerabilities. In response, we've reimplemented the method (and the very rarely used <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> class, which had a similar issue) to eliminate the insecure behavior entirely. This change could technically affect users in a number of different ways (discussed under &quot;Incompatible changes&quot; below), but in practice, the only problem users are likely to encounter is with Windows. If you are using those APIs under Windows, you should skip 32.0.0 and go straight to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a> which fixes the problem. (Unfortunately, we didn't think of the Windows problem until after the release. And while we <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava#important-warnings\">warn that <code>common.io</code> in particular may not work under Windows</a>, we didn't intend to regress support.) Sorry for the trouble.</p>\n<h4>Incompatible changes</h4>\n<p>Although this release bumps Guava's major version number, it makes <strong>no binary-incompatible changes to the <code>guava</code> artifact</strong>.</p>\n<p>One change could cause issues for Widows users, and a few other changes could cause issues for users in more usual situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The new implementations of <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6535\">throw an exception under Windows</a>.</strong> This is fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a>. Sorry for the trouble.</li>\n<li>This release makes a binary-incompatible change to a <code>@Beta</code> API in the <strong>separate artifact</strong> <code>guava-testlib</code>. Specifically, we changed the return type of <code>TestingExecutors.sameThreadScheduledExecutor</code> to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. The old return type was a package-private class, which caused the Kotlin compiler to produce warnings. (dafaa3e435)</li>\n<li>This release <em>adds</em> two methods to the Android flavor of Guava: <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. Those methods do not work under an Android VM; we added them only to help our tests of the Android flavor (since we also run those tests under a JRE). Android VMs tolerate such methods as long as the app does not call them or perform reflection on them, and builds tolerate them because of our new Proguard configurations (discussed below). Thus, we expect no impact to most users. However, we could imagine build problems for users who have set up their own build system for the Android flavor of Guava. Please report any problems so that we can judge how safely we might be able to add other methods to the Android flavor in the future, such as APIs that use Java 8 classes like <code>Stream</code>.
