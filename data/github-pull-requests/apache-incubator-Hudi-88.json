What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new maven profile to generate unified Javadoc for all Java and Scala classes.  Given that most modules have Java classes only, and only two modules, `hudi-spark` and `hudi-cli`, have Scala source code (only a few files), it is better to put the apidocs of all classes in one place.\r\n\r\nSince most classes are in Java, the Javadoc is chosen to generate the apidocs, with [genjavadoc-plugin](https://github.com/lightbend/genjavadoc) to translate Scaladoc comments into Java source so that the `javadoc` tool can recognize them.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add a new maven profile `javadocs` to generate unified Javadoc at the project root.  By running `mvn clean javadoc:aggregate -Pjavadocs`, the apidocs pages are generated under `target/site/apidocs`.\r\n  - Add documentation in `README.md` regarding the above.\r\n  - Fix one issue in `IncrementalRelation.scala` that caused the following error while generating the Javadoc:\r\n   ```\r\n[ERROR] /Users/yihua/tech/repo/incubator-hudi/hudi-spark/target/genjavadoc/org/apache/hudi/IncrementalRelation.java:[17,58] type argument scala.runtime.Nothing$ is not within bounds of type-variable T\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nScreenshots showing Java and Scala classes in the same apidocs:\r\n\r\n`AvroConversionHelper.scala`\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-01-06 at 10 33 15

HoodieSparkSqlWriter to delete records from a dataframe containing only record keys when using global indices because delete does not use partition from global indices.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request allows Hudi deletes with only record_key for global indices. I don't see any way to avoid this because keyGenerators will always fail if the partition value field is not included. Having an API with delete(List<RecordKey> deleteKeys) will not be sufficient either as any keyGenerator transformations on the record_key would not happen then. This works around this by allowing the keyGenerators to always pass.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request has minimal changes. The changes have been manually tested and verified.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIntroduce configurations and new modes of sorting for bulk_insert.\r\n- New configuration of sorting for bulk_insert:\r\n  - `hoodie.bulkinsert.sort.mode`: which mode of sorting should be used.  Three sorting modes are implemented: global sort (`\"global_sort\"`), local sort inside each RDD partition (`\"partition_sort\"`) and no sort (`\"none\"`).\r\n- Three modes of bulk_insert regarding sorting:\r\n  - No sort: no sorting is executed, only doing coalesce with repartition disabled in Spark.\r\n  - Global sort: sort the Hudi records across all RDD partitions for bulk_insert, by using `sortBy()` in Spark\r\n  - Local sort inside each RDD partition: only sort the Hudi records within each RDD partition, by using `mapPartitions()` and local sort in Spark\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nMajor changes inside `hudi-client` package:\r\n- `HoodieWriteConfig`: add the new configuration regarding the sorting mode for bulk_insert\r\n- `CopyOnWriteInsertHandler`, `LazyInsertIterable`, and `BulkInsertMapFunction`: generalize the logic in these classes to handle the steam of Hoodie records which may not be sorted\r\n- `BulkInsertInternalPartitioner`, `GlobalSortPartitioner`, `RDDPartitionSortPartitioner`, `NonSortPartitioner`: implementation of the built-in bulk insert partitioners\r\n- `UserDefinedBulkInsertPartitioner`: extend the interface to indicate whether the records in a RDD partition are sorted\r\n- `BulkInsertHelper`: modify the bulk insert logic to respect the configured sorting mode\r\n- `TestBulkInsertInternalPartitioner`: add unit tests around the new bulk insert partitioners\r\n- `TestCopyOnWriteActionExecutor`: add unit tests to verify the end-to-end behavior of bulk insert in different sorting modes\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- New unit tests added in `TestBulkInsertInternalPartitioner` and `TestCopyOnWriteActionExecutor` around the new bulk insert partitioners and the end-to-end behavior of bulk insert in different sorting modes pass.\r\n- All other unit tests in hudi-client pass.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nHUDI depends on `hive-exec` which contains a number of dependencies which have version conflicts with the dependencies required by Spark. Specifically, we are going to upgrade HUDI to `spark 2.4.4` which depends on `avro 1.8.2`, whereas `hive-exec` brings in `avro 1.7.7`. \r\n\r\nWe have run into many issues arising form the way that `hive-exec` packages its dependencies. To address these issues, we are choosing to move to `hive-exec:core` which does not include these dependencies. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nChange poms to use hive exec with the `core` classifier. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nVerified by ensuring spark and hive queries in https://hudi.apache.org/docker_demo.html#step-4-a-run-hive-queries continue to work as expected.

before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nif use `ANALYZE TABLE table_name COMMPUTE STATISTICS` to get hudi table rows, hive will collect \r\nall parquet file in table path. Now let hudi table to identify which files are the latest Hudi files, so that hive can get a right result for stats.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n```shell\r\n

Why do I create this PR\r\n\r\nThe current `HoodieSparkSqlWriter` record the `commitTime` after checking the input `hoodieRecords` is not empty. `isEmpty()` is a Spark action that will trigger all the transformations before this. So if we do some heavy Spark transformation before writing as Hudi dataset, the commit time will be the time that `isEmpty()` was finished, instead of the time we start the Spark job.\r\nSo I am making this PR to move the commit time to the beginning of the Spark job.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n*This pull request move the commit time to the beginning of Spark job*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Modify write in HoodieSparkSqlWriter\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test

Migrating to Scala 2.12\r\n- Migrating to spark-streaming-kafka-0-10\r\n- Adapting Kafka and Zookeeper\r\n\r\nThis includes some changes that are in https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/pull/1005 as well, but that PR is not merged yet.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this PR is to migrate to Scala 2.12. Along the way I had to upgrade the spark-streaming-kafka version from 0.8 to 0.10, because there is no spark-streaming-kafka-0.8 version for Scala 2.12.\r\n\r\nspark-streaming-kafka-0.10 uses Kafka 2.0 with the new Consumer API. ~In order to test it, I had to adapt some test classes from Spark core.~ I use KafkaTestUtils from Spark.\r\n\r\nUnit and integration tests do pass, but I haven't checked what has to be done in order to test with Docker. This if my first PR, so feel free to correct and advise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## *Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review
