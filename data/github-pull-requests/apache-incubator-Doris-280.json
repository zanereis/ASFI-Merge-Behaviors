Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\nExternal hms catalog table column names in doris are all in lower case, while iceberg table or spark-sql created hive table may contain upper case column name, which will cause empty query result. This pr is to fix this bug.\r\n1. For parquet file, transfer all column names to lower case while parse parquet metadata.\r\n2. For orc file, store the origin column names and lower case column names in two vectors, use the suitable names in different cases.\r\n3. FE side, change the column name back to the origin column name in iceberg while doing convertToIcebergExpr.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n6. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nThis PR #14381 limit the `ExtractCommonFactorsRule` to handle only `WHERE` predicate,\r\nbut the predicate in `ON` clause should also be considered. Such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE `nation` (\r\n  `n_nationkey` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `n_name` varchar(25) NOT NULL,\r\n  `n_regionkey` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `n_comment` varchar(152) NULL\r\n)\r\nDUPLICATE KEY(`n_nationkey`)\r\nDISTRIBUTED BY HASH(`n_nationkey`) BUCKETS 1\r\nPROPERTIES (\r\n\"replication_allocation\" = \"tag.location.default: 1\"\r\n);\r\n\r\n\r\nselect * from\r\nnation n1 join nation n2\r\non (n1.n_name = 'FRANCE' and n2.n_name = 'GERMANY')\r\nor (n1.n_name = 'GERMANY' and n2.n_name = 'FRANCE')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere should be predicates:\r\n```\r\nPREDICATES: `n1`.`n_name` IN ('FRANCE', 'GERMANY')\r\nPREDICATES: `n2`.`n_name` IN ('FRANCE', 'GERMANY')\r\n```\r\nOn each scan node.\r\n\r\nThis PR fix this issue by removing the limit of `ExtractCommonFactorsRule` \r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n1. Add unixtime type to represent unix-timestamp. It's -1 when the real arguments > INT.MAX. We don't use `int` because the `long` value will be cast to INT.MAX and then we always get the largest time 2038-1-19 rather than null\r\n2. Change the scale of default datev2  from 0 to 6 so we can be compatible the smaller precision \r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\nThis pr makes `explain verbose` more readable\r\nwe print slot descriptor with its name and Expression ID.\r\n\r\nLet's take some examples to illustrate its benifit.\r\n### 1. link

JOIN(BROADCAST)[]\r\n        equal join conjunct: a[#2] = a[#0]  \r\n```\r\nit is not easy to see what is the datatype of a[#2] from tuple descriptor table\r\nNow we have \r\n```\r\n| Tuples:

tuple.\r\nfrom above pic, we see that slot165 comes from slot155 not slot157, and its nullable value is wrong.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\nThe former logic of cooldown task production is limited to maximum 2 per data dir, we could accelerate the efficiency by first removing this limitation. \r\nBesides the oldest_write_timestamp seems useless, it cloud be removed. \r\nThe tablet would be assigned one cooldown priority due the cooldowntime and it's file size, the currently priority mechanism is simple, we can use one more fine-grained one in the future.\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n`index_searcher_cache` is cache file descriptor of inverted index,  if open file descriptor limit of the Linux system is set too small and config `inverted_index_searcher_cache_limit ` is too big, during high pressure load maybe cause \"Too many open files\".\r\n\r\nSo set config `enable_write_index_searcher_cache ` default to `false`,  and reduce config `inverted_index_searcher_cache_limit ` default to `5%`.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to open `enable_write_index_searcher_cache` when the query pressure is greater than the write pressure.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n1. When the process memory is insufficient, print the process memory statistics in a more timely and detailed manner.\r\n\r\n2. Support regular GC cache, currently only page cache and chunk allocator are included, because many people reported that the memory does not drop after the query ends.\r\n\r\n3. Reduce system available memory warning water mark to reduce memory waste\r\n\r\n4. Optimize soft mem limit logging\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nOvercommit memory means that when the memory is sufficient, it no longer checks whether the memory of query/load exceeds the exec mem limit.\r\n\r\nInstead, when the process memory exceeds the limit or the available system memory is insufficient, cancel the top overcommit query in minor gc, and cancel top memory query in full gc.\r\n\r\nPreviously only query supported overcommit memory, this pr supports load, including insert into and stream load.\r\n\r\nDetailed explanation, I will update the memory document in these two days~\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/doris/blob/15bd56cd43a40869871972a0e708b0094ba7c39e/docs/zh-CN/docs/admin-manual/maint-monitor/memory-management/memory-limit-exceeded-analysis.md\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nfix all bugs in `mergeGroup()`\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nbug:\r\n- Removed Group (after merge) also may be in Job Stack.\r\n- mergeGroup() should deal with separately the different condition (whether reinsertGroupExpr and existedGroupExpr are in same Group)\r\n- Due to PhysicalEnforcer just in lowestCostPlans, isn't in `groupExpressions`, need to notice it.\r\n- PhysicalEnforcer have a owner Group, but owner-Group's physicalExpression don't include it (due to avoid dead loop)\r\n- we also should move/merge\r\n  -  physical property in GroupExpression\r\n  - lowestCostPlans in Group\r\n- .... more detail bug\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\nAccording to our test, the query speed is faster than that without bkd index when the hit volume of bkd index is small, otherwise, it is slower, so we add `try_query` logic. When the estimated hit volume reaches `config::query_bkd_inverted_index_limit_percent`, will downgrade to query without bkd index. \r\n\r\ndependency pr: https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/14211 https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/15807 https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/15823\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

load. This auth is only open for be, and fe auth still only support http basic auth.\r\n\r\nI will use this auth for mysql load to build a no-auth stream load from fe to be. \r\nAnd this will avoid double auth in mysql load.\r\nMore information to see the design doc.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n1. Spark dpp\r\n \r\n\tMove `DppResult` and `EtlJobConfig` to sparkdpp package in `fe-common` module.\r\n\tSo taht `fe-core` is longer depends on `spark-dpp` module, so that the `spark-dpp.jar`\r\n\twill not be moved into `fe/lib`, which reduce the size of FE output.\r\n\t\r\n2. Modify start_fe.sh\r\n\r\n\tModify the CLASSPATH to make sure that doris-fe.jar is at front, so that\r\n\twhen loading classes with same qualified name, it will be got from doris-fe.jar firstly.\r\n\t\r\n3. Upgrade hadoop and hive version\r\n\r\n\thadoop: 2.10.2 -> 3.3.3\r\n\thive: 2.3.7 -> 3.1.3\r\n\t\r\n4. Override the IHiveMetastoreClient implementations from dependency\r\n\r\n\t`ProxyMetaStoreClient.java` for Aliyun DLF.\r\n\t`HiveMetaStoreClient.java` for origin Apache Hive metastore.\r\n\r\n\tBecause I need to modified some of their method to make them compatible with\r\n\tdifferent version of Hive.\r\n\t\r\n5. Exclude some unused dependencies to reduce the size of FE output\r\n\r\n\tNow it is only 370MB (Before is 600MB)\r\n\t\r\n6. Upgrade aws-java-sdk version to 1.12.31\r\n\r\n7. Support AWS Glue Data Catalog\r\n\r\n8. Remove HudiScanNode(no longer support)\r\n\r\nTODO: add doc in next PR\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n3. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n6. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-18T04:42:13Z","updated_at":"2023-01-23T04:11:03Z","closed_at":"2023-01-20T06:42:16Z","merged_at":"2023-01-20T06:42:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"726427b795083617f4a38d8841483fc52e017ae6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1691596842,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkxNTk2ODQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/load","name":"area/load","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues
