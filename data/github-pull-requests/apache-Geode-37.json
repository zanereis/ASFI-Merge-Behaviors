f0c96db changed the `FederatingManager` class so that it reuses the same `ExecutorService` between restarts. After that change, if we start the manager after previously starting and stopping it, we get `RejectedExecutionException` because it tries to invoke a task on the same `ExecutorService` which has been shut down.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the `FederatingManager` so that it invokes a supplier to get a new `ExecutorService` each time it is started to prevent the `RejectedExecutionException`.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Aaron Lindsey <alindsey@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: Kirk Lund

these exceptions in `TcpServerDependenciesTest`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n              // TODO - TCP socket related classes\r\n              .or(type(SocketCreator.class))\r\n

.or(type(SSLConfigurationFactory.class))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis work is being done in pursuit of [GEODE-7343](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-7343) which will break all dependencies from from the `org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.tcpserver` package to classes in `geode-core`. The end goal of that ticket is to move the `tcpserver` package into its own module, `geode-tcp-server` that will have no dependencies on `geode-core`. That new module will serve both `geode-core` and the eventual `geode-membership` module.\r\n\r\nTo eliminate the dependencies on `SocketCreator`, I defined a new interface, `TcpSocketCreator` and a factory method that turns a `SocketCreator` into one of those: `TcpSocketCreator.asTcpSocketCreator(SocketCreator)`.\r\n\r\nThe new `TcpSocketCreator` interface is a vastly narrowed (5 methods vs 50 methods) version of the `SocketCreator` class used throughout `geode-core`. This new interface has only the methods needed to server the needs of classes in the `tcserver` package (eventually the `geode-tcp-server` module).\r\n\r\nIn places where we were creating `SocketCreator` and using that to construct a `TcpClient` or `TcpServer`, we're now using `asTcpSocketCreator()` to adapt to the new (narrow) interface.\r\n\r\nThe other dependencies e.g. `SSLConfigiurationFactory` were easier to eliminate. I simply extracted construction of those objects up out of `TcpServer` and `TcpClient` as constructor parameters. Dependency injection wins.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

part of the effort to sever dependencies on `geode-core` in `geode-membership` we are severing ties on `geode-core` in `TcpServer`. This PR eliminates two such dependencies on `geode-core` in `TcpServer`:\r\n\r\n* `PoolStatsHelper`\r\n* `CoreLoggingExecutors`\r\n\r\nFormerly, the `TcpServer` constructor took a `PoolStatHelper poolHelper` parameter. `TcpServer` retained that parameter. It then constructed a new `ExecutorService` via `CoreLoggingExecutors.newThreadPoolWithSynchronousFeed()`. In the `TcpServer.restarting()` method it also had to create an `ExecutorService` the same way.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the `TcpServer` constructor to take a `Supplier<ExecutorService>`. That supplier hides both the `PoolStatHelper` class and the `CoreLoggingExecutors` class (from `TcpServer`).\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

It was subsequently reverted. The first commit re-applies the changes from the original PR.\r\n\r\nThe second commit fixes an issue where `Get70.cmdExecute()` throws a `NullPointerException` when `InternalRegion.getRegionPerfStats()` returns null. The latter method returns null in the case where the `InternalRegion` is a `PartitionedRegion` and its data store has not been initialized:\r\n```\r\n  @Override\r\n  public CachePerfStats getRegionPerfStats() {\r\n    PartitionedRegionDataStore ds = getDataStore();\r\n    CachePerfStats result = null;\r\n    if (ds != null) {\r\n      // If we don't have a data store (we are an accessor)\r\n      // then we do not have per region stats.\r\n      // This is not good.

PR gathers metrics session responsibilities, which have become scattered across too many core Geode classes, and encapsulates them into a small set of closely related classes.\r\n\r\nChanges to core Geode classes:\r\n\r\n- GemFireCacheImpl no longer holds a meter registry or the set of \"user\"\r\n  registries added by the cache builder.\r\n\r\n- InternalCacheBuilder no longer constructs objects on behalf of the\r\n  metrics session.  Instead, it gathers meter registries and other\r\n  details into a MetricsService.Builder, which it passes to the\r\n  InternalDistributedSystem.Builder.\r\n\r\n- InternalDistributedSystem no longer knows about client meter\r\n  registries. Instead, it holds a MetricsService, which remembers its\r\n  builder.  During reconnect, the InternalDistributedSystem retrieves\r\n  the builder from its metrics service, and uses the builder to build\r\n  a similar metrics service in the reconnected system.\r\n\r\nNew classes and interfaces (org.apache.geode.metrics.internal):\r\n\r\n- StandardMeterBinder\r\n  - Binds standard meter binders to the meter registry.\r\n  - close() closes the closeable binders, freeing their resources.\r\n\r\n- MetricsService interface\r\n  - Extends MetricsSession.\r\n  - Adds methods to start and stop the service, and to access the\r\n    service's meter registry.\r\n  - Adds a method that returns the builder that built the metrics\r\n    service, so that reconnect can use the same builder to build the\r\n    metrics service for the reconnected system.\r\n\r\n- InternalDistributedSystemMetricsService\r\n  - Implements MetricsService.\r\n  - Creates and retains a composite meter registry to manage meters.\r\n  - Configures the composite composite registry:\r\n    - Adds common tags that describe the system\r\n    - Adds client meter registries to the composite.\r\n    - Applies a StandardMeterBinder to add standard meters to the\r\n      registry.\r\n  - Discovers, starts, and stops metrics publishing services.\r\n  - Adds and removes sub-registries as instructed by publishing\r\n    services.\r\n  - When stopped, stops each publishing service, closes all closeable\r\n    meter binders, removes all sub-registries, and closes its composite\r\n    meter registry.\r\n\r\n- MetricsService.Builder interface\r\n\r\n- InternalDistriburtedSystemMetricsService.Builder\r\n  - Implements MetricsService.Builder\r\n  - Accumulates and retains constructor parameters for the eventual\r\n    InternalDistributedSystemMetricsService.\r\n  - In particular, maintains a collection of meter registries added by\r\n    the cache builder. It calls these 'persistent' registries, because\r\n    they will persist across reconnects.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Dale Emery <demery@pivotal.io>\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
