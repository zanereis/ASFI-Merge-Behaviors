For example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA issue #1.

process in case a\ndag refresh is demanded or an update is made to a dag.\nThis is annoying as you might end up with old code in\nthe views or the dreaded \"scheduler has put this in the\ndb, but the webserver hasnt got it yet.\n\nBy maintaining a last_modified field in the db and\ncomparing this to what the individual workers know,\nthe dagbag will now be updated.\n","created_at":"2016-06-17T12:42:49Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T10:25:54Z","closed_at":"2016-11-04T10:25:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b0305fbcb7ea7608810bcdd7286f41babcd04339","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1603/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1603/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1603/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/e8e7e1873f46015a1c9274c0053cd10a77bb45ab","head":{"label":"bolkedebruin:webserver_load_dag","ref":"webserver_load_dag","sha":"e8e7e1873f46015a1c9274c0053cd10a77bb45ab","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38505714,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODUwNTcxNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"bolkedebruin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin/airflow","description":"AirFlow

175 tests passed\n- confirmed that the new page:\n  - shows no parameter if expose_config is false\n  - shows all parameters if expose_config is true, including environment variables such as AIRFLOW__CORE__FOO=bar\n\nRight now the config page (when set to display) just loads the airflow.cfg and lists that,\nso any configuration values that are set via an environment variable are not shown.\nThis patch add a new page that shows all configuration values which are loaded via any means,\nonly if expose_config is set to true.\n","created_at":"2016-06-15T19:21:00Z","updated_at":"2016-10-24T06:25:17Z","closed_at":"2016-10-24T06:25:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54fa54d5a645315f008ed9e88aa2dc95c8f942c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1597/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1597/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1597/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/a109a41ecc3b2a99f660bd7ecb25d17b03683e14","head":{"label":"sekikn:AIRFLOW-227","ref":"AIRFLOW-227","sha":"a109a41ecc3b2a99f660bd7ecb25d17b03683e14","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59171319,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTE3MTMxOQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"sekikn/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn/airflow","description":"Apache

plays a magical trick to make imports for operators and hooks\neasier. The current implementation of this trick has two draw backs:\n1. It swallows exceptions if the hook or operator can't be imported for\n   some reason.\n2. It tries to import every single hook and operator the first time that\n   the `__init__.py` method is touched.\n\nThis patch addresses these two issues by replacing import_module_attrs\nwith a module wrapper that handles all imports lazily, and throws proper\nexceptions when imports fail.\n\nThe patch works for both styles of importing:\n\n```\nfrom airflow.operators import SubDagOperator\n```\n\nAs well as:\n\n```\nfrom airflow import operators\noperators.BashOperator(...)\n```\n","created_at":"2016-06-11T03:21:42Z","updated_at":"2016-06-29T03:19:16Z","closed_at":"2016-06-29T03:19:16Z","merged_at":"2016-06-29T03:19:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"dc84fdecdfd9de12392c4e1c92005bd427d3ca37","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1586/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1586/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1586/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/dc84fdecdfd9de12392c4e1c92005bd427d3ca37","head":{"label":"criccomini:AIRFLOW-200","ref":"AIRFLOW-200","sha":"dc84fdecdfd9de12392c4e1c92005bd427d3ca37","user":{"login":"criccomini","id":167569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini","html_url":"https://github.com/criccomini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d6d3f53673ba3736d7a858531823933cfef2bb4e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-68\n\nThis particular issue arises because of an alignment issue between\nstart_date and schedule_interval. This can only happen with cron-based\nschedule_intervals that describe absolute points in time (like “1am”) as\nopposed to time deltas (like “every hour”)\n\nIn the past (and in the docs) we have simply said that users must make\nsure the two params agree. But this is counter intuitive. As in these\ncases, start_date is sort of like telling the scheduler to\n“start paying attention” as opposed to “this is my first execution date”.\n\nThis patch changes the behavior of the scheduler. The next run date of\nthe dag will be treated as \"start_date + interval\" unless the start_date\nis on the (previous) interval in which case the start_date will be the\nnext run date.\n","created_at":"2016-06-07T07:58:29Z","updated_at":"2016-06-11T11:47:59Z","closed_at":"2016-06-11T11:47:59Z","merged_at":"2016-06-11T11:47:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"f69eec3b44cbb0a0fb46a17baec195f7f3baf50e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1575/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1575/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1575/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/f69eec3b44cbb0a0fb46a17baec195f7f3baf50e","head":{"label":"bolkedebruin:align_startdate","ref":"align_startdate","sha":"f69eec3b44cbb0a0fb46a17baec195f7f3baf50e","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38505714,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODUwNTcxNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"bolkedebruin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin/airflow","description":"AirFlow

preliminary PR addresses the following issue:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-160\n\nAs referenced in the JIRA issue, this PR aims to parse user DAG files in child processes to make the scheduler more robust. The main change occurs in the `SchedulerJob._execute()`. The overall flow for  scheduling is:\n\nIn the main process\n- Scan the DAG directory and create a list of paths to potential DAG definition files\n- Create child processes, a new one for each file but only N processes at once\n\nIn the child process\n- Figure out the task instances that should be run for DAGs in the file\n- Create those task instances in the ORM with the `QUEUED`state\n\nIn the main process\n- As processes finish, query ORM for task instances in the `QUEUED` state\n- Prioritize task instances and send them to the executor\n- Repeat continuously for the specified duration\n\nSome more notes:\n- The `DagFileProcessor` class creates the child process.\n- Due to serialization issues, a normal `DAG` object wasn't passed from the child process to the main process. Instead, a simplified DAG object with the fields necessary for scheduling were passed instead.\n- A DAG file that's slow to parse / schedule doesn't block other DAG files from being scheduled (provided there is sufficient parallelism)\n- There is a user specified limit on how frequently DAG files should be parsed.\n- Tasks have to be sent to the executor from the main process as it's necessary to coordinate pools and prioritization of task instances.\n- Removed the option in `DagBag` to sync to DB. Instead, DAGs are sync'ed to the DB in a separate call.\n\nExample log output:\n\n```\n[2016-05-31 06:53:11,048] {jobs.py:1132} INFO - Searching for files in /home/paul_yang/airflow/dags\n[2016-05-31

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-179\n\nThis PR adds MySQL specific logic for serializing a cell leveraging the `literal` method which applies the necessary encoding specific to the connection. \n\nNote an alternative approach would have to made `_serialize_cell` a non-static method allowing for more flexibility and thus one could do, \n\n```\n self.get_conn().literal(cell)\n```\n\nhowever it is extremely inefficient to get the connection for every value being injected into the table.\n\nGiven that `HivePrestoTest` is disabled within Travis which provides the necessary test coverage, I tested  this change locally and verified that non-ASCII characters where correctly injected into MySQL.

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-179\n\nIn addition to correctly serializing non-ASCII characters the literal transformation also corrects an issue with escaping single quotes (').\n\nNote it was my intention to add another unit test to `test_hive_to_mysql` in `tests/core.py` however on inspection the indentations of the various methods seemed wrong, methods are nested and it's not apparent what class they refer to. Additionally it seems a number of the test cases aren't related to the corresponding class.\n\nFor testing purposes I simply ran a pipeline which previously failed with the following exception,\n\n```\n[2016-05-26 22:03:39,256] {models.py:1286} ERROR - 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 230: ordinal not in range(128)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/airflow/models.py\", line 1245, in run\nresult = task_copy.execute(context=context)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/airflow/operators/hive_to_mysql.py\", line 88, in execute\nmysql.insert_rows(table=self.mysql_table, rows=results)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/airflow/hooks/dbapi_hook.py\", line 176, in insert_rows\nl.append(self._serialize_cell(cell))\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/airflow/hooks/dbapi_hook.py\", line 196, in _serialize_cell\nreturn \"'\" + str(cell).replace(\"'\", \"''\") + \"'\"\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/future/types/newstr.py\", line 102, in __new__\nreturn super(newstr, cls).__new__(cls, value)\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 230: ordinal not in range(128)\n```\n\nand verified with the presence of the fix that the task succeeded and the resulting output was correct. Note currently from grokking the code base it seems that only `MySqlHook` objects call the the `insert_rows` method.\n","created_at":"2016-05-26T22:16:40Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T18:22:36Z","closed_at":"2016-05-27T17:58:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fae525596465108c096e4ce935a601f16acefc5b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1550/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1550/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1550/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c4e58d23385ada5e7b5db28db969e5d8d8699195","head":{"label":"john-bodley:dbapi_hook_serialization","ref":"dbapi_hook_serialization","sha":"c4e58d23385ada5e7b5db28db969e5d8d8699195","user":{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59783957,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTc4Mzk1Nw==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"john-bodley/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

This patch fixes that by returning\nimmediately if a dagrun has already occured with an @once\nschedule.\n\n@aoen @mistercrunch @jlowin: this is actually a bug in the 1.7.1.2 scheduler but only gets exhibited after AIRFLOW-124 due to eager creation of tasks.

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-180\n\nIn the previous state of the code, datetime.now was compared to\nstarted_at and seconds was pulled out. It turns out that the seconds\nattribute of a timedelta has a maximum of 86400 and the rolls up to 1 day.\nThe unintended consequence is that timeout larger than 86400 are\nignored, with sensors running forever.\n\nTo fix this we use the total_seconds method to get at the real\ntimedelta in seconds.\n","created_at":"2016-05-26T17:33:12Z","updated_at":"2016-06-20T23:02:44Z","closed_at":"2016-06-20T23:02:44Z","merged_at":"2016-06-20T23:02:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"c38a5c2a8b227194ec52d81e8a5a85c97751ecd9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1547/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1547/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1547/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c38a5c2a8b227194ec52d81e8a5a85c97751ecd9","head":{"label":"artwr:artwr_fix_sensor_timeout","ref":"artwr_fix_sensor_timeout","sha":"c38a5c2a8b227194ec52d81e8a5a85c97751ecd9","user":{"login":"artwr","id":1518713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTg3MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1518713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr","html_url":"https://github.com/artwr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":41347156,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTM0NzE1Ng==","name":"airflow","full_name":"artwr/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"artwr","id":1518713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTg3MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1518713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr","html_url":"https://github.com/artwr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/artwr/airflow","description":"AirFlow

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-152\n\nCurrently there is a 'task_params' option which can add to or override\nvalues in the params dictionary for a task, but it is only available\nwhen running a task with 'airflow test'.\n\nBy accepting this parameter in 'airflow run' and then passing it to the\nsubprocess through the command method in the TaskInstance class this\noption can be supported.\n\nThis has use cases in running tasks in an ad-hoc manner where a\nparameter may define an environment (i.e. testing vs. production) or\ninput / output locations and a developer may want to tweak them on the\nfly.\n","created_at":"2016-05-20T06:34:33Z","updated_at":"2016-11-16T05:31:24Z","closed_at":"2016-11-16T05:31:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"414b1a6628e17632566ca811e9cf0dd818d06d56","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1529/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1529/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1529/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/40a4fc37698cc338bd2f4673f2ed92eb5c5f22dc","head":{"label":"trilogy-group:master","ref":"master","sha":"40a4fc37698cc338bd2f4673f2ed92eb5c5f22dc","user":{"login":"trilogy-group","id":22237814,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIyMjM3ODE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22237814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group","html_url":"https://github.com/trilogy-group","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59250377,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTI1MDM3Nw==","name":"contently-incubator-airflow","full_name":"trilogy-group/contently-incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"trilogy-group","id":22237814,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIyMjM3ODE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22237814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group","html_url":"https://github.com/trilogy-group","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trilogy-group/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/trilogy-group/contently-incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/issues/1383 among several other things.\nThere are tons of things broken/missing here, I'm just putting this out there to get some initial eyes on the high-level changes.\n\n**Goals**\n- Simplify, consolidate, and make consistent the logic of whether or not a task should be run\n- Provide a view that gives insight into why a task instance is not currently running (no more viewing the scheduler logs to find out why a task instance isn't running for the majority of cases)\n  e.g. (this will not be the final product):\n  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1592778/14835487/daf435e4-0bbe-11e6-9650-844543bb82e7.png)\n\n**Things to review in this PR**\n- The high level idea of refactoring of all of the dependency checking for regular task execution, backfills, etc into one single function\n- Any of the functional changes (not the code itself) made listed in \"Some big changes made in this PR\"\n- The design of the BaseTIDep class\n- Any changes in design that would require a complete rewrite of the current changes (where it would be non-trivial to change the code in the PRs diff to conform with the new design)\n\n**Things NOT to review in this PR**\n- The view layer for surfacing the failing dependencies to users\n- Bugs/debugging statements that should be removed/lack of tests/lack of comments/etc.\n- Failing CI/merge conflicts, due to the somewhat large scope of this change I will iterate on a fixed SHA on master and then either rebase all at once or break the PR up into smaller parts and release them individually\n- Performance/DB hits (Max had some valid concerns and I will test for this and optimize/cache as appropriate)\n\n**Some big changes made in this PR**\n- Running a backfill in the command line and running a task in the UI will now display detailed error messages based on which dependencies were not met for a task instead of appearing to succeed but actually failing silently\n- Pool behavior in backfills is now consistent with how regular tasks are pooled (pools are always respected in backfills).\n  This will break one use case:\n  Using pools to restrict some resource on airflow executors themselves (rather than an external resource like a DB), e.g. some task uses 60% of cpu on a worker so we restrict that task's pool size to 1 to prevent two of the tasks from running on the same host. When backfilling a task of this type, now the backfill will wait on the pool to have slots open up before running the task even though we don't need to do this if backfilling on a different host outside of the pool. I think breaking this use case is OK since the use case is a hack due to not having a proper resource isolation solution (e.g. mesos should be used in this case instead).\n- To make things less confusing for users, there is now a \"ignore all dependencies\" option for running tasks, \"ignore dependencies\" has been renamed to \"ignore task dependencies\", and \"force\" has been renamed to \"ignore task instance state\". The new \"Ignore all dependencies\" flag will ignore the following:\n  - task instance's pool being full\n  - execution date for a task instance being in the future\n  - a task instance being in the retry waiting period\n  - the task instance's task ending prior to the task instance's execution date\n  - task instance is already queued\n  - task instance has already completed\n  - task instance is in the shutdown state\n  - WILL NOT OVERRIDE task instance is already running\n- SLA miss emails will now include all tasks that did not finish for a particular DAG run, even if the tasks didn't run because depends_on_past was not met for a task\n- Failed tasks will no longer be considered \"runnable\", they must be force-run or cleared first from the UI to be run, just like successful tasks\n- New CLI command task_failing_deps\n- Queuing a task into a pool that doesn't exist will now get stopped in the scheduler instead of a worker\n\n**Future Work (will not be released in the first version)**\n- Show one more dagrun in the tree view (even when that dagrun's execution date hasn't occurred yet) so that users can see why task instances in the next dagrun are blocked. I wanted to include this in the first release but it's non-trivial to do (one way to solve this is to generate DAG runs before their execution date occurs). You can still view a non-existent task instance by passing the right query parameters to the task instance page, or by querying via the new command-line command.\n- Break down failed dependency explanations better (e.g. if the trigger rules requiring all upstream task successes fails, indicate the specific upstream tasks that failed)\n- Make failing dependencies for task instances more visible to users (e.g. asynchronously display failing dependencies when mousing over a task instance in the tree view).\n- Parallelize task instance dependency checking.\n- Indicate that a task isn't running because it was manually cleared: if a task is manually cleared the scheduler won't automatically rerun it, but there is no way of knowing this for sure without some kind of flag that marks the task state as cleared.\n- Can potentially add tips to fix a failing dependency in the new view that shows failed task instance dependencies (e.g. for \"depends_on_past\" when the last task state is failing we can give the tip to get this task to succeed, or even provide a button to clear it right from that view)\n- Additional task instance dependencies, e.g. there are no schedulers running (a task can't get scheduled until a scheduler is running), or the airflow scheduler queue is backed up, or no executors being available to run the task instance\n- Forcing tasks in the UI should give users feedback on why their task didn't get forced (e.g. task was already running)\n- Keep history of changes to blocked dependencies that are accessible via the UI (this is useful to know why a task's execution was delayed)\n\nTests for dependency contexts are missing, I will add them once I get an an initial LGTM\n\n@mistercrunch @jlowin @plypaul

script (based on the Spark utility here: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/dev/merge_spark_pr.py) makes it simpler to merge PRs and automatically close JIRA issues.\n\nIt is a guided workflow that reduces the chance of committers inadvertently doing something they really didn’t mean to do.\n\nUsage:\n\n``` bash\n# the script will prompt for a PR number\nairflow/dev/merge-airflow-pr.py\n\n# or you can pass one\nairflow/dev/merge-airflow-pr.py 1515\n```\n\n… and just follow the instructions.\n\nBonus points for using the script to merge this PR.\n\nHere is the output of `merge-airflow.pr.py --help`:\n\n```\n./merge-airflow-pr.py --help\nUsage: merge-airflow-pr.py [OPTIONS] [PR_NUM]\n    Utility for creating well-formed pull request merges and pushing them\n    to Apache.\n\n    This script assumes you already have a local Airflow git folder and that you\n    have added remotes corresponding to both (i) the github apache Airflow\n    mirror and (ii) the apache git repo.\n\n    To configure the script, set the following env vars:\n    - AIRFLOW_GIT\n        The location of your Airflow git development area (defaults to the\n        current working directory)\n\n    - PR_REMOTE_NAME\n        GitHub remote name (defaults to \"github\")\n\n    - PUSH_REMOTE_NAME\n        Apache git remote name (defaults to \"apache\")\n\n    - JIRA_USERNAME\n        ASF JIRA username. Required to automatically close JIRA issues\n\n    - JIRA_PASSWORD\n        ASF JIRA password. Required to automatically close JIRA issues\n\n    - GITHUB_OAUTH_KEY\n        Only required if you are exceeding the rate limit for a single IP\n        address.\n\n```\n","created_at":"2016-05-18T22:20:02Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T13:19:05Z","closed_at":"2016-05-20T18:40:47Z","merged_at":"2016-05-20T18:40:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"7e56bd4f9491b16cfafc48c888375fc856730d69","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1515/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1515/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1515/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/7e56bd4f9491b16cfafc48c888375fc856730d69","head":{"label":"jlowin:PR-MERGE","ref":"PR-MERGE","sha":"7e56bd4f9491b16cfafc48c888375fc856730d69","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54388220,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDM4ODIyMA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"jlowin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin/airflow","description":"Airflow

addresses _AIRFLOW-128_.\n\n@aoen @artwr @mistercrunch @r39132 @jlowin : ready for review.\n\n**Goals:**\n- Improve readability of the code and generic assumptions (getters should not change a state) for DagRuns\n- Improve robustness and lower risk of race conditions in the scheduler\n- Reduce amount of calls to the database, limit connections in the scheduler\n- Identify speed optimizations possibilities\n\n**What has changed:**\n- Two new TaskInstance states have been introduced. \"REMOVED\" and \"SCHEDULED\". REMOVED will be set when taskinstances are encountered that do no exist anymore in the DAG. This happens when a DAG is changed (ie. a new version). The \"REMOVED\" state exists for lineage purposes. \"SCHEDULED\" is used when a Task that did not have a state before is sent to the executor. It is used by both the scheduler and backfills. This state almost removes the race condition that exists if using multiple schedulers: due to the fact UP_FOR_RETRY is being managed by the TaskInstance (I think that is the wrong place) is still exists for that state.\n- get_active_runs was a getter that was also updating to the database. This patch refactors get_active_runs into two different functions that are now part of DagRun. 1) update_state updates the state of the dagrun based on the taskinstances of the dagrun. 2) verify_integrity checks and updates the dag run based on if the dag contains new or missing tasks. \n- DagRun.update_state has been updated to not call the database twice for the same functions. This reduces the time spent here by 50% in certain occasions when having many tasks in a Dag that need to be evaluated. Still this needs to be faster: for those Dags with many tasks the aggregation query in TaskInstance.are_dependencies_met is very expensive. It should be refactored.\n- process_dag has been updated to use the functions and cleaned up, making it much more readable. Tasks are now properly locked by the database. I have played with multiprocessing here (on dagruns and taskinstances) but left it out for now. Fixing the above will help more I think.\n\n**Stats:**\n- New scheduler time spent at earlier stages is a bit more, due to eager creation of TaskIntances\n- Old scheduler MAX is higher due to \"are_dependencies_met()\" called twice\n- New scheduler fluctuates a bit more due to database locking and \"are_dependencies_met\" scanning the table (needs to wait for lock). \n\nOld:\n\n``` bash\n2016-05-23 11:17:39,031 INFO - Loop took: 0.018685 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:17:44,022 INFO - Loop took: 0.013455 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:17:49,033 INFO - Loop took: 0.018868 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:17:54,031 INFO - Loop took: 0.019578 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:17:59,024 INFO - Loop took: 0.013051 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:18:05,026 INFO - Loop took: 1.010049 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:18:10,399 INFO - Loop took: 1.390761 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:18:32,112 INFO - Loop took: 18.104715 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:19:03,432 INFO - Loop took: 31.089109 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:19:14,140 INFO - Loop took: 10.492135 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:19:38,339 INFO - Loop took: 24.05553 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:20:06,281 INFO - Loop took: 27.887196 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:20:30,215 INFO - Loop took: 23.9155 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:20:53,953 INFO - Loop took: 23.375444 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:21:29,168 INFO - Loop took: 35.191994 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:22:42,276 INFO - Loop took: 72.384736 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:23:06,276 INFO - Loop took: 23.831495 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:23:38,852 INFO - Loop took: 32.333608 seconds\n```\n\nNew:\n\n``` bash\n2016-05-23 11:26:12,021 INFO - Loop took: 0.011257 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:26:17,031 INFO - Loop took: 0.018259 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:26:22,021 INFO - Loop took: 0.01233 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:26:27,026 INFO - Loop took: 0.017952 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:26:32,031 INFO - Loop took: 0.017606 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:26:37,707 INFO - Loop took: 0.697367 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:26:43,268 INFO - Loop took: 1.255278 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:27:01,234 INFO - Loop took: 14.225399 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:27:03,832 INFO - Loop took: 2.580292 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:27:35,556 INFO - Loop took: 29.534056 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:27:55,896 INFO - Loop took: 20.321862 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:28:10,192 INFO - Loop took: 14.250471 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:28:40,778 INFO - Loop took: 30.337702 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:28:49,003 INFO - Loop took: 8.135393 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:29:09,132 INFO - Loop took: 19.923375 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:29:46,856 INFO - Loop took: 37.393256 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:30:30,984 INFO - Loop took: 43.79019 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:31:09,856 INFO - Loop took: 38.444254 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:31:31,164 INFO - Loop took: 21.061177 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:32:29,776 INFO - Loop took: 58.153763 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:33:12,128 INFO - Loop took: 42.105758 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:33:50,796 INFO - Loop took: 38.137385 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:34:40,290 INFO - Loop took: 49.115855 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:35:22,900 INFO - Loop took: 42.269646 seconds\n2016-05-23 11:35:38,456 INFO - Loop took: 15.453262 seconds\n```\n\n*\\* Note: unittests have been added to cover process_dag **\n\n**Dag used for testing:**\n- Please note that both schedulers this Dag does not even finish.
