SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes some issues with the IBM Db2 engine spec:\r\n\r\n#### Connection issues\r\nWhen trying to establish a connection to an IBM Db2 Cloud Instance, below error is displayed in case

the version limits in `setup.py`.\r\n\r\n#### Unable to create a physical dataset\r\nTrying to create a virtual dataset would return an error, because `get_table_comment()` returns a `Tuple()` for this engine:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96086495/00d47fc6-2f01-4c04-bbd6-3e003423d6db)\r\n\r\nstack trace:\r\n```\r\n2024-01-22

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIt's currently not possible to fix the initial map box view. The current settings are not used when setting up the initial view. \r\nThe initial is auto calculated from bounds, and in some cases doesn't seem to place all the points on the screen.\r\nThis PR adds a drop down to enable a \"fixed\" initial view option which will use the user entered settings as the initial view instead of the calculation from bounds.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/4665758/1e1990b5-a91f-4d51-bd0b-8f3d1f656b91)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nBy default, the MapBox chart will still auto calculate the initial view from the bounds.\r\nTo test the fixed option, set the Initial Viewport settings dropdown to fixed and update the default lat/long/zoom\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

This also means that since users create the router - there's no longer any difference in the rendering aspect for memory/browser/hash routers (which only impacts router/history creation) - so we can get rid of those and trim to a simple <code>RouterProvider</code></p>\n<pre lang=\"jsx\"><code>// Before\nfunction App() {\n  &lt;DataBrowserRouter&gt;\n    &lt;Route path=&quot;/&quot; element={&lt;Layout /&gt;}&gt;\n      &lt;Route index element={&lt;Home /&gt;}&gt;\n    &lt;/Route&gt;\n  &lt;DataBrowserRouter&gt;\n}\n<p>// After\nlet router = createBrowserRouter([{\npath: &quot;/&quot;,\nelement: &lt;Layout /&gt;,\nchildren: [{\nindex: true,\n</code></pre></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nRight now, the dependency checker action blocks PRs if they introduce a package with a \"high\" severity CVE. This is becoming counterproductive in several PRs, particularly as we mess around with cleaning up packages. For example, you might fix one or more `critical` issues by upgrading to packages that include a `high` issue in their dependency tree. Let's just block on `critical` for now, and tigthen the screws after 4.0, perhaps.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

This issue was briefly discussed in this PR: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26372#issuecomment-1889676989\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96086495/2c3ec066-9ce1-44af-a7d8-0a6035813d4b)\r\n\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96086495/573d1264-e45d-4304-b4aa-826195a90d6a)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Make sure that `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` is disabled. \r\n2. Create a legacy line chart with a temporal column and a time grain applied.\r\n3. Enable `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` and access the chart.\r\n4. Make sure that the Time Grain field is still visible. \r\n\r\nI also created charts using all nvd3 charts + all viz types using `legacyTimeseriesTime` and confirmed that changing the FF value did not introduced any issues, and the time grain field was visible and working.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/26474\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue:

SUMMARY\r\nSystem tags used to be filtered from the Tags list (by filtering tags with `:` on their name). As a consequence, any user-created tag that included `:` were not listed as well. https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26324 fixed the issue by showing PRs with `:`, which re-introduced system tags to the table. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `custom_tag` boolean filter operator to the Tags API so that system tags are properly filtered out from the API response. Filtering these tags in the Client/Frontend side is not effective since your first page might be only system tags, so you would end up with 0 results in the table (and no option to paginate) + you would also end up with inconsistent counts per page.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96086495/da60182f-127c-4bef-87ad-9fc193730ae0)\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96086495/df345af4-072f-45f8-b0c1-f047e4fa2bfb)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nFollowing up #26313\r\nThis commit addresses and resolves the issue of an unclear drop zone indicator that was negatively impacting the user experience in the dashboard editor. \r\n\r\nWhen a component was being dragged towards the edge of the tab container or the row/column containers, multiple drop indicators were often displayed. This created confusion about the exact insertion point of the element. [fig. 1]\r\n\r\n|fig. 1|\r\n|--|\r\n|![drop-indicator-bug](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1392866/b984aebb-2dd0-48bf-b49f-86e49e535e73)|\r\n\r\nThe root of the problem was that these dashboard components were wrapped by both draggable and droppable interfaces, which led to overlapping and conflicting drop zones. This commit modifies this by making the dashboard components draggable only, and builds a distinct, non-conflicting area for the drop zone. Moreover, it also highlights the drop zone during the dragging process to clearly indicate where the element will be placed.

script running a single command given the parameters, so it can be reused to run multiple build commands in parallel while orchestrating in GitHub actions. I tried to DRY what was in there cautiously\r\n1. changed GitHub actions to generate a matrix of commands for each \"target\" (dev, lean, lean39, lean310, ...) and \"platform\" (linux/amd64,

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis needs discussion! \r\n\r\nDoes anyone see a need for docker builds on every PR? The only purpose seems to be as a canary for docker builds on master. Now that this takes about 75 minutes of build time for every PR, I think we should just stop it, and bring back a more optimized/parallelized version if someone wants to invest in that. People keep an eye on builds on master pretty regularly, so let's just revert anything that breaks this if/when we need to.\r\n\r\nHopefully, this will save a lot of coal out there somewhere in the world.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26552 bumped `swagger-ui-react` from 4.1.3 to 5.11.0. As a side effect, the `react-redux` dependency in `yarn.lock` was also upgraded from 7.1.20 to 9.0.4 which requires React 18. Given that the `docs` project uses React 17, it produced the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAttempted import error: 'useSyncExternalStore' is not exported from 'react' (imported as 'React2').\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother side effect of the upgrade was:\r\n\r\n```\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'url' in '/home/runner/work/superset/superset/docs/\r\nnode_modules/@saucelabs/theme-github-codeblock/build/theme/ReferenceCodeBlock'\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.\r\nError:  Client bundle compiled with errors therefore further build is impossible.\r\nThis is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.\r\nIf you want to include a polyfill, you need to:\r\n\t- add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { \"url\": require.resolve(\"url/\") }'\r\n\t- install 'url'\r\nIf you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:\r\n\tresolve.fallback: { \"url\": false }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts the change.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nI ran into this issue where I had duplicates in tagged_object that prevented the deletion of a dashboard. This PR adds a unique constraint to that table, preventing this issue from happening again. This may create another error on update or insert of a dashboard object, hoping a unit test would catch that if there's such a raise condition.\r\n\r\nThe error I observed was:\r\n```\r\nsqlalchemy.orm.exc.StaleDataError: DELETE statement on table 'tagged_object' expected to delete 2 row(s); Only 3 were matched.\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking into my database and researching the issue, I found dups in my tagged_object table:\r\n```\r\nmysql> select * from tagged_object where object_type ='dashboard' and object_id=11 LIMIT 10;\r\n+---------------------+---------------------+-----+--------+-----------+-------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n| created_on          | changed_on          | id  | tag_id | object_id | object_type | created_by_fk | changed_by_fk |\r\n+---------------------+---------------------+-----+--------+-----------+-------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n| 2024-01-16 15:21:13 | 2024-01-16 15:21:13 | 133 |      3 |        11 | dashboard   |             1 |             1 |\r\n| 2024-01-16 16:19:29 | 2024-01-16 16:19:29 | 180 |      4 |        11 | dashboard   |             1 |             1 |\r\n| 2024-01-16 16:19:29 | 2024-01-16 16:19:29 | 181 |      4 |        11 | dashboard   |             1 |             1 |\r\n+---------------------+---------------------+-----+--------+-----------+-------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nHandling it on the cascade delete seemed harder than preventing it, and prevention is also a great thing. Note that this includes a migration that does delete eventual dups too.\r\n\r\n# phase 2 - fixing the root cause\r\nAfter setting up the unique constraint, I hit the root cause, something around auto-owner management where we maintain special owner tags for objects. The approach was to delete-and-recreate them all systematically, and I think the logic + transaction handling was the root cause for the dups. I changed the logic there to go id-by-id and remove and only remove or add individual ids if needed.\r\n\r\nI also cleaned up the API to upsert tags it gets instead of raising issue. So if you call the API now to add a tag that's already set, it won't return an error, just add if needed. \r\n\r\n# reuse code in alembic migration\r\nI cracked a solution to share a module across alembic migrations. Somehow that's way more tricky than it seems, I failed at least a few times before at finding a solution for this. We now have `superset/migrations/migration_utils.py` for that purpose\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-17T21:36:33Z","updated_at":"2024-07-10T21:02:19Z","closed_at":"2024-01-19T23:12:54Z","merged_at":"2024-01-19T23:12:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"12838038449d4c4efdad749a2fe8f6d936e4375e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1127990345,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTI3OTkwMzQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/risk:db-migration","name":"risk:db-migration","color":"e67e22","default":false,"description":"PRs

SUMMARY\r\nexport/import currently attempts to bring in annotations that are attached to charts, but does not handle the dependencies properly, resulting in some referential integrity-type issues. This happens when the annotation depends on either an \"annotation layer\", or on another chart that doesn't exist in the current environment.\r\n\r\nThe solution here is lazy, and refrains from importing any annotation that may depend on other objects that are not handled by the current import/export logic.\r\n\r\nLonger term solution would including handling of dependencies, and allowing the users to package dependencies on export and/or ask/warn about what to do here. \r\n\r\n### TESTING\r\nOn top of a simple unit test on the new function I introduce, I conducted the following manual test\r\n* exported a dashboard that contains a chart with multiple annotations of different types\r\n* deleting the chart objects in the environment\r\n* importing using the CLI\r\n* verifying that only FORMULA annotation survived the export/import\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-17T18:49:52Z","updated_at":"2024-07-02T23:50:12Z","closed_at":"2024-01-19T23:13:19Z","merged_at":"2024-01-19T23:13:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"e86d4d3c92b91da0aa09bc215908c23f261b4f9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329203144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MjAzMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/M","name":"size/M","color":"705FA3","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5111009119,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABMKPPXw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/v3.0","name":"v3.0","color":"0070C9","default":false,"description":"Label

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhile end users deal with Superset+Trino we are observing quite some 500 errors on backend.\r\n\r\nFor example, a user can create/edit a virtual dataset and make mistakes in SQL. Trino client raises the exception and it goes uncaught to 500.\r\n\r\nIf SupersetDBAPIProgrammingError is raised it's better to return 400 to the end user because nothing bad happens with Superset instance.\r\n\r\nI don't know what to do with `SupersetDBAPIError` in general. If underlying Database has problems, should it lead to Superset's 500 or it's ok to stay with 400 because Superset itself works fine.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
