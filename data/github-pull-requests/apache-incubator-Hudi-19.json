Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe reason for this change is that 4th module of Azure CI could fail non-deterministically, and our best guess is that this module is somehow correlated with other modules, e.g., folders. Before we have bandwidth to root cause it, we decide to containerize Azure CI to rule out the possibility of module correlation.\r\n\r\nIn details, \r\n1. We created a base docker image named \"apachehudi_azure_ci_base\" and push it to apachehudi docker hub repo.\r\n2. For each Azure CI module, we build a image by copying the hudi repo with the PR changes into the base image.\r\n3. For each Azure CI module, we run the build-and-test command in both UT and FT tests. The idea steps should be build-testUT-testFT; however, it is hard to make the container keeps the file changes in the build step after switch to the following test tasks in Azure.\r\n4. We modified the pom file to use the maven-thrift-plugin for Azure CI tests but keep using the existing logic for thrift compilation for GH CI tests.  \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIsolate Azure CI test modules. Potentially we can do it for all modules.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nSince Flink 1.17, Flink SQL support more advanced alter table syntax.\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- add a new column \r\nALTER TABLE MyTable ADD category_id STRING COMMENT 'identifier of the category';\r\n-- modify a column type, comment and position\r\nALTER TABLE MyTable MODIFY measurement double COMMENT 'unit is bytes per second' AFTER `id`;\r\n-- drop columns\r\nALTER TABLE MyTable DROP (col1, col2, col3);\r\n-- rename column\r\nALTER TABLE MyTable RENAME request_body TO payload;\r\n```\r\nFind more detail information in [Flink Alter Table SQL ](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.18/docs/dev/table/sql/alter/).\r\n\r\nWe could support schema evolution by Flink SQL.\r\nThe [last pr](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/10426) supported it based on `HoodieHiveCatalog`.\r\nThis pr aims to support schema evolution based on `HoodieCatalog`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

the current implementation of data skipping, column statistics for the entire table are read and then subjected to data skipping filtering operations based on these stats. When the table has a large volume of data and a high number of partitions, this approach can reduce the efficiency of data skipping, as partition pruning conditions are not utilized.\r\n\r\nBy pushing down the conditions for partition filtering to after the column statistics are read and applying pruning at that point, the size of the column stats that are subsequently involved in data skipping will be significantly reduced. This not only saves time on later computations but also conserves memory.\r\n\r\nDuring a test conducted on a table with a total of 25TB distributed across 60 subpartitions, a query was performed on one of the subpartitions, which was 1.4TB in size. Overall, this simple test demonstrated that data skipping can lead to a savings of several seconds. In scenarios involving partition pruning, time savings are indeed achievable. Additionally, there will be a substantial reduction in the memory footprint for the list of candidate files needed for further computation.\r\n\r\nIn scenarios where partition pruning is not applied, this query would only result in a minimal increase in cost. This minor cost increase is inconsequential either when the data volume is large—making these seconds-level overheads negligible—or when the data volume is small, eliminating the need for partitioning altogether, in which case the filter operation would not be time-consuming.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nPushing Down Partition Pruning Conditions to Column Stats During Data Skipping\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** This is the same implementation as in #9553 but for 0.14.x line.\r\n\r\nWe are looking to fix two problems by adding per log file marker. \r\na. i. MOR data table rollbacks missed to sync original log files from failed commit to MDT. \r\na.ii. Along these lines, if rollback instant is retried multiple times, any log files added from failed rollback attempts should also be synced to MDT. \r\nb. If there are spurious log files created even w/ successful commits, we need to ensure these spurious log files are also synced to MDT. \r\n\r\nSo, to fix all of the above, we are adding per log file marker. Any log file added or appended to will create markers. We don't really need to distinguish between create and append and so we will go w/ APPEND IoType for markers. \r\n\r\nFix for (a. i): Any log file added will emit a marker. If the commit of interest failed, hudi will trigger a rollback. During rollback planning, using markers we identify the original log files added by the failed commit and track it as part of the rollback plan. This also gets tracked in HoodieRollbackMetadata (had to upgrade the schema for this purpose). \r\n\r\nFix for (a.ii): Whenever a rollback is triggered, hudi adds a rollback command block. With this patch, we are also emitting markers for such log files. During rollback execution, apart from adding log files added by failed commit to HoodieRollbackMetadata, we also add these log files which could have been added by previous attempts of rollback for the same instant. \r\n\r\nFix for (b): During marker based reconciliation step, we check for log files from markers and compare it against HoodieCommitMetadata's HoodieWriteStat. If for any additional files tracked using markers (which could happen due to spark retries), we will add new  HoodieWriteStat and update HoodieCommitMetadata. So, that when this syncs to MDT, we don't miss to track this spurious log files. We will use https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/9545 to skip such spurious log files on the reader side. So, on the writer side, we just want to ensure we don't miss to track any log file created by hudi. \r\n\r\nNote: Please do note that the reconciliation for log files is kind of opposite of what happens w/ data files. w/ data files, any extraneous files are deleted. But for any extaneous log files, we can't afford to delete. Since there could be a concurrent reader trying to read the the file slice of interest. Eventually during execution, it might parse the log block header and might skip if its partially failed commit or inflight commit. Anyways, in short, we can't afford to delete any log files at any point in time except cleaner. So, for any extraneous log files detected, we fix the HoodieCommitMetadata to track these additional log files as well. \r\n\r\nNotes to reviewers to assist in reviewing: \r\n\r\nI will break down diff set of changes and the classes to review for the same. \r\n\r\n1. Adding per log file marker for regular log files: Added a callback(AppendLogWriteCallback) for this purpose since we may not know the log file name upfront (unlike data files). New apis are introduced to Markers for this purpose. \r\nCheck files HoodieWriteHandle, HoodieAppendHandle, HoodieLogFormatWriter, HoodieLogFormat, HoodieLogFileWriterCallback\r\nDirectWriterMarkers, TimelineServerBasedMarkers, WriteMarkers, RequestHandler. \r\n\r\n2. Schema upgrade for rollback metadata. \r\n   Check file HoodieRollbackMetadata.avsc\r\n\r\n3. Rollback from DT when synced to MDT: w/ the schema upgrade, we will fetch \"logFilesFromFailedCommit\" in HoodieRollbackMetadata and make a delta commit to MDT. \r\n HoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter and HoodieTableMetadataUtil.\r\n\r\n4.Rollback plan changes:\r\nWhen using Marker based rollback strategy, we poll markers to find the log files added. Apart from log file names, we also need the actual size. So, we do fs listing to fetch the file lengths. We track these as part of HoodieRollbackRequest.logFilesWithBlocksToRollback. There are chances that some files could be missing which are tracked in markers. We can ignore these files since this could happen (just after creating marker file, lets say the process crashed w/o creating the actual log files)\r\nClasses to check: MarkerBasedRollbackStrategy\r\n\r\n5. New argument to StorageScheme named listStatusUnfriendly. Depending on storage scheme, the file system based listing to triage the actual size of the log files of interest could change. As per this patch, we only have one way to do this. But in a follow up patch, we might have to fix that. \r\n\r\n6. Fixing HoodieCommitMetadata to include HoodieWriteStat for any missing log files which are extraneous through markers. \r\nClasses to check: SparkRDDWriteClient.commit and addMissingLogFileIfNeeded(). This also includes the file system listing to fetch the actual size of spurious log files if any. \r\n\r\n7. Rollback execution: \r\na. With this patch, we are also emitting markers for rollback command blocks (log files). \r\nb. During execution, we also need to fetch any log files added by previous attempts of rollback and update HoodieRollbackSat if need be. Note that we can have only one HoodieRollbackPlan per partition. \r\nClasses: BaseRollbackHelper. \r\n\r\n8. Misc: \r\nHoodiePairData to add join() support. HoodieListPairData, HoodieJavaPairRDD.\r\nFsUtils.getFileStatusesUnderPartition to assist in fetching file statuses for some interested log files. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMDT in sync with filesystem\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nHigh. \r\nMore rigorous testing will be done. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

the current implementation of data skipping, column statistics for the entire table are read and then subjected to data skipping filtering operations based on these stats. When the table has a large volume of data and a high number of partitions, this approach can reduce the efficiency of data skipping, as partition pruning conditions are not utilized.\r\n\r\nBy pushing down the conditions for partition filtering to after the column statistics are read and applying pruning at that point, the size of the column stats that are subsequently involved in data skipping will be significantly reduced. This not only saves time on later computations but also conserves memory.\r\n\r\nDuring a test conducted on a table with a total of 25TB distributed across 60 subpartitions, a query was performed on one of the subpartitions, which was 1.4TB in size. Overall, this simple test demonstrated that data skipping can lead to a savings of several seconds. In scenarios involving partition pruning, time savings are indeed achievable. Additionally, there will be a substantial reduction in the memory footprint for the list of candidate files needed for further computation.\r\n\r\nIn scenarios where partition pruning is not applied, this query would only result in a minimal increase in cost. This minor cost increase is inconsequential either when the data volume is large—making these seconds-level overheads negligible—or when the data volume is small, eliminating the need for partitioning altogether, in which case the filter operation would not be time-consuming.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nPushing Down Partition Pruning Conditions to Column Stats During Data Skipping\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, AWS Glue sync works and provides 2 interfaces - one is `HoodieHiveSyncClient` using Hive, then Glue -> Hive implementation(hidden by AWS), and another is `AWSGlueCatalogSyncClient`.\r\nBoth of them have limitations - although Hive has improved a bit to use pushdown on a big scale still fails and fallback may not work for certain partitioning schemes.\r\nFor syncing to Glue using `HoodieHiveSyncClient`, there is a set of limitations:\r\n1. Create/update is not parallelized under the hood, meaning for big sets it's very slow - empirically it's about 40 partitions/sec MAX, which translates to minutes for bigger scale.\r\n2. The pushdown filter is not really effective since for 1st case(specifying exact partitions) - it works unpredictably, since the longer the partition value you have, the fewer partitions you can specify, in our case we cannot specify > 100 partitions, therefore it falls back to min-max predicate.\r\n3. Min-max predicate does not work if the number of partitions is growing with nesting, e.g. on level 1 there are 10, on level 2 there are 100, on level 3 there are 1000. In this case, min-max will cut down high-level ones, but load all levels down, therefore not really making optimization.\r\n4. When there is e.g. a schema change, Hive-Glue calls `cascade`, and for big tables it's impossible to sync in meaningful time - although for Glue -> Hudi does not specify schema on partition level, so this is wasted effort.\r\nThis is why `AWSGlueCatalogSyncClient` is preferable. But there are other problems with it.\r\nParticular list of problems:\r\n1. Create/Update/Delete were not optimized before - now optimized to be async, but without a meaningful high border, it will simply reach the request limit and stay there. **This solution adds a parameter for such parallelism and creates parallelization logic.**\r\n2. Listing all partitions is used always for `AWSGlueCatalogSyncClient` - this is way suboptimal since the goal of this is to distinguish which of changed-since-last-sync are created and which are deletes, therefore more optimal API can be used - [`BatchGetPartition`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/webapi/API_BatchGetPartition.html). Also, it can be parallelized easily. **I added a new method to sync client classes and moved Hive-pushdown into a Hive-specific class and implemented this method for the AWSGlue client class. Also, parameter controlling parallelism is added.**\r\n3. Listing all partitions is suboptimal - it is still needed for initial sync/resync, but it's done in a straightforward way and is suboptimal. In particular - it uses basic `nextToken` which makes it sequential and works slowly in heavily partitioned tables. AWS has an improvement for this particular [method](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/webapi/API_GetPartitions.html), called `segment`. This allows us to basically create 1 to 10 start positions and use standard(`nextToken`) API to list partitions. Also - [last public version of Hive-> Glue interface implementation uses it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/webapi/API_GetPartitions.html).\r\nWhen we switched from the Hive sync class to AWS Glue specific - first what we faced is performance degradation with the listing. **I added `segment` API parameter usage and added parameter controlling parallelism.**\r\n\r\nAll this has been tested for a partitioned table with >200k partitions.\r\nI managed to get speed improvement from 2-3 minutes to 3 seconds. Let me know if you are interested in numbers.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThere is a new config added with the default value from AWS Glue-Hive(parallelism of 5) - while before it was sequential, so I don't expect it to be failing, but we may set parallelism to 1 to be backward-compatible for whatever reasons.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n**Need to adjust the website, but please let me know if you are ok with the changes, I'll proceed then.**\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen writing data with BoundedInMemoryQueue, the size of record is sampled periodically and BoundedInMemoryQueue is adjusted dynamically during runtime. Prior to this PR, the sampling rate is fixed and not configurable.\r\n\r\nAs I tested, about 9% CPU is used to estimate the object size to calculate the queue size. \r\n\r\nCurrently the sampling rate is set to 64. If we can set the rate to 128, then we can save 4.5% CPU theoretically.\r\nNote: Increasing sampling rate has diminishing returns beyond a certain threshold depending on record layout/schema.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/19326824/ff75623e-0d68-4cbf-adbc-66923683e552)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nimprove performance by setting higher sampling rate\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n- Add a new configuration named `hoodie.write.buffer.record.sampling.rate`, default 64. Higher value leads to lower CPU usage for object size estimation.\r\n- Add a new config named `hoodie.write.buffer.record.cache.limit` for better memory footprint control, default 128*1024.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

the picture, csi will use parquet chunk block meta calculate min/max value, and save it to mdt col stat.

the current version, HoodieFileIndex is a member variable of HoodieBaseRelation. PR #7871 has made Hudi's acquisition of Relation behave more like Spark's. However, in Spark, the relation is cached as follows:\r\n```\r\ncatalog.getCachedPlan(qualifiedTableName, () => {\r\n  val dataSource = DataSource(\r\n    sparkSession,\r\n    userSpecifiedSchema = if (table.schema.isEmpty) None else Some(table.schema),\r\n    partitionColumns = table.partitionColumnNames,\r\n    bucketSpec = table.bucketSpec,\r\n    className = table.provider.get,\r\n    options = dsOptions,\r\n    catalogTable = Some(table)\r\n  )\r\n  LogicalRelation(dataSource.resolveRelation(checkFilesExist = false), table)\r\n})\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results in the continuous use of the same HoodieFileIndex instance.\r\n\r\nHowever, HoodieFileIndex contains cached items like cachedAllPartitionPaths and cachedAllInputFileSlices, which only reset upon creating a new HoodieFileIndex. A sparkSession will only execute refreshTable when actions like 'insert' are performed. If HoodieFileIndex is never refreshed, then a SparkSession that only executes queries will always see the version that was cached during the initial query. This is not the expected behavior. In practice, Delta Lake seems to attempt updating the snapshot with each listFiles operation. After PR #7871, Hudi would recreate the relation with each query, obtaining the latest snapshot. Therefore, I believe there should be an assessment at the start of listFiles to determine whether the cache (snapshot) needs to be updated.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nDetermine Whether to Update

the current code version, support for column stats has not yet been extended to handle complex nested data types, such as map-type data structures. Take the table tbl as an example, which is defined with three fields: an integer field id, a string field name, and a map-type field attributes. Within this table structure, the id and name fields support column stats, and as such, HUDI will generate the corresponding column stats indices for these two fields at the time of table creation. However, no corresponding index will be generated for the attributes field. The specific table creation statement is as follows:\r\n```\r\ncreate table tbl (\r\n  id int,\r\n  name string,\r\n  attributes map<string, string>\r\n) ...\r\n```\r\nTo elaborate further, consider the following insert operation:\r\n```\r\ninsert into tbl values\r\n(1, 'a1', map('color', 'red', 'size', 'M')),\r\n(2, 'a2', map('color', 'blue', 'size', 'L'));\r\n```\r\nAfter the execution of the insert, the content of the column stats should be as follows:\r\n```\r\na.parquet   id     min: 1   max: 1   null: 0\r\nb.parquet   id     min: 2   max: 2   null: 0\r\na.parquet   name   min: 'a1' max: 'a1' null: 0\r\nb.parquet   name   min: 'a2' max: 'a2' null: 0\r\n```\r\nThis means that there is no column stats index for the attributes column.\r\nBased on the table tbl, when we execute a query:\r\n\r\n#### Queries containing both columns supported and not supported by column stats\r\nLet's consider a query adjusted to:\r\n`select * from tbl where attributes.color = 'red' and name = 'a1'`\r\nAt this point, queryReferencedColumns includes attributes and name, and the queryFilters are as follows. \r\n```\r\nisnotnull(attributes#95)\r\nisnotnull(name#94)\r\n(attributes#95[color] = red)\r\n(name#94 = a1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe content of transposedColStatsDF is shown below:\r\n```\r\n+--------------------+----------+-------------------+-------------------+--------------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n|            fileName|valueCount|attributes_minValue|attributes_maxValue|attributes_nullCount|name_minValue|name_maxValue|name_nullCount|\r\n+--------------------+----------+-------------------+-------------------+--------------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n|3363b50e-ca25-4fb...|         1|               null|               null|                   1|           a2|           a2|             0|\r\n|876af2ed-d529-4df...|         1|               null|               null|                   1|           a1|           a1|             0|\r\n+--------------------+----------+-------------------+-------------------+--------------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implies that targetIndexedColumns is the intersection of targetColumnNames and indexedColumns, and indexedColumns, by default, includes all the schema fields of the table (tableSchema.fieldNames.toSet) when we haven't explicitly configured a column stats list. This includes the Map type attributes, and targetColumnNames includes columns relevant to the query, so the intersection still results in targetColumnNames and name.\r\nReturning to the code for transposedRows, because there are no corresponding column stats for attributes, rows where min=null, max=null, and null_count=valueCount are added to avoid errors during subsequent where filtering. This is the origin of attributes_minValue, attributes_maxValue, and attributes_nullCount in the resulting DataFrame.\r\nLet's revisit getCandidateFiles and take a closer look at the assembly of indexFilter. The queryFilters mentioned earlier are processed in translateIntoColumnStatsIndexFilterExpr, where expressions are transformed, defaulting to True if they cannot be converted. We can skip over name since it's a string type and can be converted directly.\r\nFor map types, there are two expressions: isnotnull(attributes#95) This hits the case:\r\n```\r\ncase IsNotNull(attribute: AttributeReference) =>\r\n  getTargetIndexedColumnName(attribute, indexSchema)\r\n    .map(colName => LessThan(genColNumNullsExpr(colName), genColValueCountExpr))\r\n```\r\nThe corresponding value is 'attributes_nullCount < 'valueCount.\r\nHowever, EqualTo expressions like (attributes#95[color] = red) should, theoretically, match equalTo cases but actually do not since AllowedTransformationExpression does not support the getMapValue type, resulting in a None and no match.\r\nUltimately, nothing matches, resulting in None, which means the expression for attributes ends up being 'attributes_nullCount < 'valueCount And True.\r\nHerein lies a problem:\r\n`acc ++= Seq(null, null, valueCount)`\r\nThe null_count for attributes always equals valueCount, so the expression 'attributes_nullCount < 'valueCount will always be False. As a result, prunedCandidateFileNames will always be empty. However, since indexDf does have value, allIndexedFileNames will not be empty, leading notIndexedFileNames to be empty.\r\nConsequently, the end result is that getCandidateFiles will always return an empty set! This presents a significant issue because the indexFilter effectively fails to filter any files based on the attributes column, due to the fact that its null_count is always set to match valueCount, rendering the condition perpetually false. \r\n\r\n#### Problem Summary\r\nUnder the existing code implementation, when data skipping is enabled and the index columns have not been explicitly specified in the parameters, if the query conditions include both columns that are supported by column stats and those that are not, no data will ever be retrieved!\r\n#### Problem Fix\r\nWe can see that the variables directly causing the issue are indexDf and indexFilter:\r\n\r\n-  indexDf includes unsupported columns, filled with inappropriate values.\r\n-  indexFilter also contains query conditions not supported by the index. And indexDf is filled with inappropriate values to adapt to these conditions.\r\n-  Moreover, the unsupported query conditions in indexFilter are obtained from filtering the schema derived from indexDf.\r\n\r\nA more straightforward fix would be to set the null_count for non-existent columns directly to null (refer to [HUDI-4250][HUDI-4202]), and incorporate this check into the isNotNull evaluation. This way, there would be no erroneous filtering leading to exceptions. However, I'm not sure what issues were encountered with null before? [HUDI-5557] removed this scenario, but setting it to value_count could also lead to errors. I would like to inquire if the issues with null and value_count are similar?  @rfyu @alexeykudinkin \r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen data skipping, filter the columns.\r\n\r\n###
