profiling of a brand new installation of jena-fuseki shows that ~75% of the time spent by `s-put` (when ingesting Turtle tuples via SPARQL) relates to the execution of `ByteBufferLib.bbcopy2()` -- often as part of B+tree operations such as `BPTreeNode.internalDelete()`.\r\n\r\n`bbcopy2()` and `bbcopy1()` perform data copy from a source ByteBuffer to a destination ByteBuffer by reading/writing one byte at a time, which is not very efficient. In addition, `bbcopy1()` makes a poor use of data cache prefetches, as it iterates the ByteBuffers in reverse order.\r\n\r\nThis commit replaces the implementation of these two functions by one that reads the input data in bulk mode into a dynamically allocated byte array and then writes its contents to the destination buffer using a bulk `put()` operation. The same approach is used to improve the performance of another bottleneck in `RecordBuffer::compare()`.\r\n\r\nThe speedup gains introduced by these code changes are consistent regardless of the number of triples being ingested into Jena:\r\n\r\nInput file: 1.2GB with 1.75M triples\r\nOriginal ingestion time: 544 secs\r\nAfter changes to bbcopy: 454 secs (1.19x speedup)\r\nAfter changes to bbcopy and compare(): 388 secs (1.40x speedup)\r\n\r\nInput file: 21MB with 154k triples\r\nOriginal ingestion time: 7.4 secs\r\nAfter changes to bbcopy: 6.0 secs (1.24x speedup)\r\nAfter changes to

Add docs.\r\n\r\nGitHub issue resolved #1644\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\n@afs, I re-read the Cypress docs and found [this page](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/introduction) talking about CI and Cypress, where they mention ways to control the order of initialization of a service like our Fuseki. I replaced `concurrently` by `start-server-and-test`, since otherwise we would have to bring `wait-on` as an extra dependency.\r\n\r\nTo review this, someone (able to reproduce the issue linked :grimacing: ) would have to run it a few times to confirm it's gone, and that everything works OK. I got the impression that `start-server-and-test` runs the Cypress tests faster than `concurrently`, but I could be wrong.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [x] Documentation change

a new `BPTreeDistinctKeyPrefixIterator` that allows iterating only records which are considered distinct based on a portion of their key.  It is effectively a skip scan based iterator that can avoid reading portions of the B+Tree where all records share the same key prefix.  This is used to improve performance of `DatasetGraphTDB.listGraphNodes()` and `SolverLibTDB.graphNames()`, in some cases dramatically so.\r\n\r\nUsed a couple of different test scenarios with calling `listGraphNodes()`:\r\n\r\n- 100k named graphs comprising a total of 125 million quads\r\n   - On 4.6.1 this takes an average of 21,480 milliseconds\r\n   - With this patch this is reduced to 18,235 milliseconds\r\n- 10 named graphs comprising a total of 177 million quads\r\n   - On 4.6.1 this takes an average of 27,856 milliseconds \r\n   - With the previous patches (#1641 and #1642) this was reduced to an average of 25,185 milliseconds\r\n   - With this new patch this is reduced to around 5 milliseconds 😄 \r\n\r\nThis resolves
