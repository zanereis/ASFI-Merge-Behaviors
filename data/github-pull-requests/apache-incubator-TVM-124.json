PR allows an external library to subclass TVM's NDArray infrastructure without too much work.\r\n\r\nIt introduces a type trait `array_type_index<T>::code`. For TVM's NDArray itself, the trait is 0; For irrelevant classes, the trait is -1; Any external subclass of TVM NDArray should override it to be a positive int32 number.\r\n\r\nTo use this extension, an external library should\r\n1) On C++ backend, inherit TVM's NDArray and NDArray container, and define the trait `array_type_index` for the NDArray.\r\n2) On C++ backend, define a constructor in the inherited class that accepts a pointer to TVM's Container, which is nullable.\r\n3) On Python frontend, inherit `tvm.nd.NDArrayBase`, define the class attribute `_array_type_index` consistent to the C++ type trait, and register the subclass using `tvm.register_extension`.\r\n\r\nCC: @tqchen, @were, @reminisce

Replaces existing text printer with one based on Section 1 of [\"A prettier printer\"](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf) by Philip Wadler; however, the printer can be improved by adopting a version later in the paper.\r\n- Adds stream-like API for the DocAtom ADT.\r\n- Adds debug printing \"pass\" that includes more traditional pretty printing style.\r\n- Adds FunctionType support.\r\n\r\n## How the printer works\r\n\r\nThe pretty printer design works roughly as follows. Instead of creating a string directly, you instead create a `Doc` that consists of a vector of `DocAtom`s. The purpose of `Doc` is to separate the text's meaning (e.g. specifying where new lines and indentations should go) from their actual layout. For example, depending on the length of a line, you may want to print\r\n```\r\nf(a, b, c, d)\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\nf(a,\r\n  b,\r\n  c,\r\n  d)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is easy to do with an abstract doc model. We can encode choices in our `Doc` specification and then let an algorithm choose the optimal layout later.\r\n\r\nThe current `DocAtom`s are `Text` and `Line`. `Text` stores a piece of text with no line breaks and `Line` stores a line break and the amount of indentation directly after it. Unless you are working with the API, you should not need to think about `DocAtom`s except that new lines should be added to a `Doc` separately from text or the line and text will be treated as a single `Text` atom instead of a `Line` and a `Text` atom.\r\n\r\nThe main way to build a `Doc` is to via the stream-like interface exposed with the following `Doc` constructor and member functions:\r\n```\r\nexplicit Doc(const std::string& str)\r\nDoc& operator<<(const Doc& right)\r\nDoc& operator<<(const std::string& right)\r\ntemplate<typename T>\r\nDoc& operator<<(const T& right)\r\nstd::string str()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe remaining functions you need to think about are:\r\n- `friend Doc Indent(int indent, const Doc& doc)`: This function returns a new `Doc` that is like `doc` except all the `Line`s inside it have had their indentation extended by `indent`.\r\n- `Doc PrintVec(const std::vector<Doc>& vec, const Doc& sep = Doc(\", \"))`: This intersperses the `sep` between every doc in `vec`.\r\n- various specific `Print` functions","created_at":"2019-02-15T22:08:33Z","updated_at":"2019-03-20T23:12:16Z","closed_at":"2019-03-20T23:11:54Z","merged_at":"2019-03-20T23:11:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"db5bfa3c6176d97db3c8fc3dc85cde3f023fe0d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

support for `alter_op_layout` for x86 that was discussed in #2585.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional comments:\r\nCurrently we have an issue where the \"vanilla\" conv2d operator can be instantiated with some \"NCHWc\" style layouts, such as \"NCHW4c,\" but not others (e.g., \"NCHW8c\" or \"NCHW16c\"). This seems to be due to an issue where the latter two are treated as a special case and handled by the x86 operator. This version seems to share basically all of the same properties as vanilla conv2d, but is not merged together with vanilla conv2d, and other parts of the stack (e.g., AutoTVM) treat these variants of conv2d as separate. It seems theoretically possible to merge the two, but that would likely come at the cost of breaking/changing a few other things (e.g., AutoTVM) and currently TOPI (shared between NNVM and Relay) treats them as separate. This PR mostly preserves the current \"organization,\" but it reuses the Conv2DAttrs node for Conv2DNCHWc, as it seems very excessive to create another identical definition.

PR proposed an improved version of ```tvm::NDArray``` signature that opens the path for future type extensions. \r\n\r\nWhile the current NDArray works great, there is a potential need to extend the NDArray itself to store additional information. This can become useful when we need to introduce variants that might be scheduled by an additional async engine, or a different form of lazy/eager execution.\r\n\r\nIn these cases, we could potentially subclass the NDArray and NDArray::Container, however, this also brings a potential need for runtime type checking. This PR adds a field ```array_type_index_``` to NDArray::Container to make the structure future compatible with the possibility of extensions.

matching and rewriting is a common task in compiler analysis. So far, we manually write code that detects the patterns and rewrite them. This PR introduces a new utility to use [expression-template](https://github.com/dmlc/mshadow/tree/master/guide/exp-template) for writing pattern matching code in C++. \r\n\r\nAs an example, here are two versions of the code to rewrite ```max(x + z, y + z) => max(x, y) + z```\r\n\r\n## Manual Pattern Matching \r\n```c++\r\nExpr MaxRewrite(Expr expr) {\r\n   auto* pmax = expr.as<ir::Max>();\r\n   if (pmax == nullptr) return expr;\r\n   auto* pa = pmax->a.as<ir::Add>();\r\n   auto* pb = pmax->b.as<ir::Add>();\r\n   if (pa == nullptr || pb == nullptr) return expr;\r\n   if (!ir::Equal(pa->b, pb->b)) return expr;\r\n   return max(pa->a, pb->a) + pa->b;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## Use Pattern Match Util \r\n```c++\r\nExpr MaxRewrite(Expr expr) {\r\n  using namespace arith; \r\n  PVar<Expr> x, y, z;\r\n  if (max(x + z, y + z).Match(expr)) {\r\n    return (max(x, y) + z).Eval();\r\n  } else {\r\n    return expr;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe template inlining will generate the same code as if we are doing manual pattern matching.\r\n\r\nSee [pattern_match_test.cc](https://github.com/tqchen/tvm/blob/1c72398ccec43b4333c275123516cd9e96e933cb/tests/cpp/pattern_match_test.cc) for more

PR adds documentation to the Relay language reference for ADTs, which are in the still-under-review PR #2442 and were described in the RFC #2175.\r\n\r\nADTs have a lot of complexity to them, so I made them a separate page, but I wonder whether that's the best choice or whether it should be a tutorial page. A lot of the material is similar to introductory functional programming examples, so I am interested on feedback on whether it's the best way to present this material. I am not sure about how much familiarity to expect with these

NNVM operators that **could** be identity under certain conditions (e.g. Cast from type A to type A) cannot be marked with FInplaceIdentity option. It is because PR #1696 changed the requirements of inplace optimization (including identity) to not check for the exact type match, and the operator itself does not have sufficient information inside FInplaceIdentity function to be able to set the option only if it is actually identity.\r\n\r\nThis PR restricts identity in the memory plan pass to honor FInplaceIdentity option from operator only if shape sizes match and if types of input and output are bitwise compatible (by which I mean cast from dtype1 to dtype2 does not change anything in memory, like going from int32_t to uint32_t).\r\n\r\n@eric-haibin-lin FYI\r\nAdding author of PR #1696 @ZhennanQin for comment if this approach still satisfies their

buffer bounds for TensorComputeOp by improving EvalSet on ranges. (#2564)\r\n\r\nBuffers used by TensorComputeOp can be unnecessarily large, as described in #2564  \r\nTighten these buffer bounds, by modifying EvalSet to use the following formula to calculate the maximum value of the range:\r\n\r\nmax(range) = max(min + extent - 1)\r\n\r\nThis formula can provide a tighter bound when min and extent share variables. \r\n\r\nFor example, if min=i and extent=(10 - i), with i in the domain [0, 9], then EvalSet currently returns [0, 18].  \r\nUsing the new formula, max(range) = max( i + (10 - i) - 1) = max(10 - 1)=max(9). \r\nTherefore EvalSet now returns [0,

reading #2523 I was messing with the newly-merged Rust API and noticed some some changes that might be helpful.\r\nThe main change this PR makes is to start adding some \"typed\" rust APIs, which look like normal rust functions / structs, and call tvm PackedFuncs under the hood. The rust graph runtime example is now much simpler:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n    let image: ndarray::Array = /* ... load image in Rust ... */;\r\n\r\n    let input = tvm_frontend::NDArray::from_rust_ndarray(\r\n        &image,\r\n        TVMContext::cpu(0),\r\n        TVMType::from(\"float32\")\r\n    )?;\r\n\r\n    let mut module = GraphModule::from_paths(\r\n        concat!(env!(\"CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR\"), \"/deploy_graph.json\"),\r\n        concat!(env!(\"CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR\"), \"/deploy_lib.so\"),\r\n        concat!(env!(\"CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR\"), \"/deploy_param.params\"),\r\n        ctx\r\n    )?;\r\n\r\n    let mut result: Vec<tvm_frontend::NDArray> = module.apply(&[&input]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, all the old PackedFunc functionality is still there. This just makes well-defined APIs a little easier to use.\r\n\r\nThis approach could be used for binding the non-runtime APIs as well, I think. (Which I want, because I kinda wanna make a tvm-backed rust deep learning framework at some point... that's the far future though ;))\r\n\r\nI've also fixed up a few other random things I've noticed:\r\n- I think the old `Function::get` implementation would break for freshly registered globals, so I made it more dynamic\r\n- I allowed `kNDArrayContainer`s to be returned from PackedFuncs without blowing up... probably. The example works, anyway. I don't entirely understand what's going on with the stuff in `common::value` though.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] more docs\r\n- [ ] more tests\r\n- [ ] run rustfmt\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n- What other APIs would be good to wrap with types?\r\n\r\nCC @ehsanmok , hope it's okay that i'm poking around in your code :)","created_at":"2019-02-04T05:32:12Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T16:06:35Z","closed_at":"2019-04-07T17:05:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e206c57ad54fd2b86fa0fd980e36a5a13a5af0d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":963830470,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NjM4MzA0NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20WIP","name":"status:

have opened a RFC (#2512) for the pass manager. This PR implements the framework of it. Currently, we support the following type of passes:\r\n- module-level passes, they mainly focuses on optimizations cross functions, like inter-procedural optimizations/analysis, addition and removal of functions.\r\n- function-level passes, they focuses on optimizations in a relay function scope\r\n\r\nEach pass works on a module. Passes could be registered in python and sent to c++. An `optimize` function is provided to accept a host of passes for analysis and optimization. The current PR only executes these passes without tuning the ordering.\r\n\r\nOne example could be:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MyClass():\r\n    def __init__(self, mod):\r\n        self.module = mod\r\n\r\n    def transform(node, pass_ctx):\r\n        \"\"\"Perform optimization on node.\"\"\"\r\n        pass\r\n\r\nmy_class = MyClass(mod)\r\ndef transform(expr, pass_ctx):\r\n    return my_class.transform(expr, pass_ctx)\r\n\r\nmodule_pass = ModulePass(\"module_pass\", 1, transform)\r\nfunction_pass = FunctionPass(\"function_pass\", 2, transform)\r\n\r\nmod = relay.Module(...)\r\npasses = [module_pass, function_pass]\r\nsequential_pass = pass_manager.SequentialPass(\"sequential_pass\", 2, passes)\r\nret_mod = sequential_pass(mod)\r\n```\r\n`ret_mod` contains all the updated information \r\n\r\nCC' @jroesch @wweic @ZihengJiang @tqchen @junrushao1994, @icemelon9, @FrozenGene, @MarisaKirisame  please review.

discussed in https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/relay-injective-ops-do-not-work-with-tuple/1526, the tuple output of subfunction may be incorrect because currently storage allocator doesn't support inplace operations.\r\n\r\nFirst, we have issue in codegen for the assert added by `ArgBinder` if the input and output buffer are the same (the testcase doesn't compile before this patch).\r\n\r\nSecond,  in the below example,\r\n```\r\n  %0 = fn(%p0: Tensor[(100, 5), float32],\r\n          %p1: Tensor[(100, 7), float32])\r\n          -> Tuple[Tensor[(100, 5), float32], Tensor[(7, 100), float32]] {\r\n    %1 = transpose(%p1, axes=None)\r\n    %2 = (%p0, %1)\r\n    %2\r\n  }\r\n  %3 = %0(%data_0, %data_1)\r\n```\r\nThe function param `%p0` is returned as one of the output tuple fields. However, new storage tokens are allocated for each output field (it should have the same storage token as the first argument).\r\n\r\nIn `OpFusion`, we copy the function argument to the output field. Since tuple output is only used in a few cases, memory copy won't cause great performance regression.\r\n\r\nPlease review @tqchen @masahi

PR adds automatic differentiation for tensor expressions (#1996). The implementation can be\r\nnaturally divided into two parts:\r\n* The automatic differentiation itself (`autodiff.cc`, `autodiff.h`, `autodiff.py`,  `test_pass_autodiff.py`). It contains an implementation of reverse-mode automatic differentiation  (the function `Differentiate`) and standard differentiation rules (the class `JacobianMutator`).\r\n* Transformations for optimizing the code generated by the autodiff (`zero_elimination.cc`, `zero_elimination.h`, `test_pass_zero_elimination.py`). This part is called zero elimination  because its goal is to eliminate generation of zero values in intermediate computations by fusing  tensors and transforming domains of iteration. Its central part is Fourier-Motzkin elimination,  currently we use our own implementation (the function `SolveSystemOfInequalities`), however in the  future we might want to consider using some libraries for manipulating polyhedra (which may be  useful for other parts of tvm as well).\r\n\r\nThere are also several helpers: functions for printing out tensors recursively in a human-readable form (`dump_tensor.cc`) and functions for applying transformations to compute bodies (in `op_util.cc`).\r\n\r\nTesting of the automatic differentiation is done in two ways:\r\n* The correctness is tested by comparing to numerically computed gradients.\r\n* We try to catch performance regressions by statically estimating some metrics (the number of operations, iterations, etc). An exception is thrown if some metric is more than 1.5x worse than  the reference value.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are several thing missing from this PR:\r\n- There is no solver for systems of linear integer equations. Instead, some ad-hoc transformations  are used which don't work in many cases and are very sensitive to things like the order of  variables. For this reason gradients for some operations like dilated and strided convolutions are  not as performant as they could be. This is the main deficiency which should be fixed in  subsequent PRs.\r\n- No tutorials and documentation, I'm planning to add them in a separate PR.\r\n- Some operations (e.g. scan) are not supported.\r\n- No integration with Relay and NNVM, we plan to do it in the future.","created_at":"2019-01-23T13:56:52Z","updated_at":"2020-03-30T20:54:09Z","closed_at":"2020-03-30T20:54:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2904d48d3988dd51ebd1cbd58878eda9c52057b7","assignee":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":970908039,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzA5MDgwMzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20RFC","name":"status:

commit 6fdc3e0 triggered the following bug. Consider this code:\r\n```python\r\n    n = 10\r\n    X = tvm.placeholder(shape=(10,), dtype='int32', name=\"X\")\r\n    k = tvm.reduce_axis((0, n))\r\n    Y = tvm.compute((), lambda: tvm.sum(X[k], k), name=\"Y\")\r\n\r\n    s = tvm.create_schedule([Y.op])\r\n    ax = s[Y.op].fuse(*Y.op.axis)\r\n    axo, axi = s[Y.op].split(ax, nparts=20)\r\n\r\n    print(tvm.lower(s, [Y, X], simple_mode=True))\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore 6fdc3e0 the generated code looked like this:\r\n```\r\nproduce Y {\r\n  for (singleton.outer, 0, 20) {\r\n    Y[0] = 0\r\n    for (rv, 0, 10) {\r\n      Y[0] = (Y[0] + X[rv])\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter 6fdc3e0 the code looks like this:\r\n```\r\nproduce Y {\r\n  for (singleton.outer, 0, 20) {\r\n    Y[0] = 0\r\n    for (rv, 0, 10) {\r\n      if (likely((singleton.outer < 1))) {\r\n        Y[0] = (Y[0] + X[rv])\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich is wrong, the result gets reset to zero. The reason is that the initialization is not guarded by the condition `singleton.outer < 1`.\r\n\r\nThe fix I propose is to skip loops related to the reduction axes instead of skipping loops unrelated to the compute op axes when generating predicates for the initialization code. The result now looks like this:\r\n```\r\nproduce Y {\r\n  for (singleton.outer, 0, 20) {\r\n    if (likely((singleton.outer < 1))) {\r\n      Y[0] = 0\r\n    }\r\n    for (rv, 0, 10) {\r\n      if (likely((singleton.outer < 1))) {\r\n        Y[0] = (Y[0] + X[rv])\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n@tqchen @derisavi Please take a

PR is going to bring graph runtime with ability of executing symbolic shape graph with ahead of time planing, eg:\r\n```\r\nb1 = tvm.var(\"batch\")\r\nshape_var_bounds = {\r\n        b1 : 128,\r\n

executing, the runtime is going to allocate maximum memory according to upper bound hint of variable. Any value smaller than the upper bound can be executed without any issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChange log:\r\n- Extending Relay Memory planing to support variable shape bound hint\r\n- Extending Model JSON file, adding field ```symbolic_shape```, ```max_bytes```, ```var_upper_bound```\r\n- Adding ``set_shape_variable``` function to graph runtime\r\n- Extending Graph runtime to support symbolic runtime with a tiny Postfix expression parser\r\n- Extending Graph runtime with a ViewCahce\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRFC: https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/2451\r\nMerge all conflicts in

the interface looks like:\r\n````\r\nmodule = tvm.hybrid.build(sch, ins, outs)\r\n````\r\nIn general, two major things are going in this PR:\r\nA hybrid script text format is supported:\r\n1. It has better naming support than the default `IRPrinter`.\r\n2. When designing hybrid script it is for Phase 0 IR, so this dumper cannot be a standalone dumper. You can only use it to dump Phase 0 IR.\r\n3. Stores hybrid script as source code.\r\n4. Can be used the same as a hybrid script function (both sw emu & hw run).\r\n\r\nMinor things:\r\n1. Hybrid code module refactor:\r\n1.1 `util.py` & `calls.py` mainly is in charge of compilation time, and `intrinsic.py` is renamed to `runtime.py` to be in charge of hybrid script runtime.\r\n1.2 Redundant `api.py` is merged to `__init.py`.\r\n2. `AssertStmt` is supported; type cast is supported as it is required by

relay_node.astext() is a quick way to print out the text format in the relay IR. previously, we include meta_data by default, this can leads to an explosive text being printed out when there is a constant weight node(which are encoded into base64).\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to switch off this option by default because the astext API is usually used for debugging.  Note that we might want to introduce another API that allows us to get the full IR, something around save_xxx.\r\n\r\nSince this API has not been released, I will propose this directly. \r\n\r\ncc
