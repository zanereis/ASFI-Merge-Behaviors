Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-22T05:06:23Z","updated_at":"2021-12-22T05:27:17Z","closed_at":"2021-12-22T05:27:16Z","merged_at":"2021-12-22T05:27:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"0d9b09488ec56099d875f2c647d8d6e5a2996b36","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/45","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/45","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/45/labels","id":7173371,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AbXT7","number":45,"title":"2.7.15","description":"","creator":{"login":"horizonzy","id":22524871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTI0ODcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22524871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy","html_url":"https://github.com/horizonzy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":22,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-21T01:47:56Z","updated_at":"2022-01-12T03:33:20Z","due_on":"2021-11-10T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-01-12T03:33:20Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9465/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9465/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9465/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/cab8ac668db4067799d6e3bd58da23274d825747","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1222_fix_pond","ref":"1222_fix_pond","sha":"cab8ac668db4067799d6e3bd58da23274d825747","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-21T03:05:52Z","updated_at":"2024-12-08T07:15:33Z","closed_at":"2021-12-21T06:10:48Z","merged_at":"2021-12-21T06:10:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"55672e430a909c4e40f2e7a2dbcad9555a595f41","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9456/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9456/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9456/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/beda6ad02137c20e9914061e982dedb4a6e1eeec","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1221_2.7_update","ref":"1221_2.7_update","sha":"beda6ad02137c20e9914061e982dedb4a6e1eeec","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-21T03:04:08Z","updated_at":"2021-12-21T06:10:43Z","closed_at":"2021-12-21T06:10:43Z","merged_at":"2021-12-21T06:10:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"3b2b20b34c3e16dd349ba5f53ef6fafa10a7b792","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9455/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9455/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9455/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d8639d7f320cfe9b06a55ebaf4c7ce3de86a8e25","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1221_2.6_update","ref":"1221_2.6_update","sha":"d8639d7f320cfe9b06a55ebaf4c7ce3de86a8e25","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-20T09:41:29Z","updated_at":"2021-12-27T07:25:45Z","closed_at":"2021-12-27T07:25:45Z","merged_at":"2021-12-27T07:25:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"ec60eb633c00f656000b7a39ff9db85b6544aaaf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9454/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9454/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9454/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e983483875babbdea06173d8f5a574d2c5e5ecc1","head":{"label":"guohao:fix-stream-err","ref":"fix-stream-err","sha":"e983483875babbdea06173d8f5a574d2c5e5ecc1","user":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":343317923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDMzMTc5MjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"guohao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guohao/dubbo","description":"Apache

changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-18T03:51:49Z","updated_at":"2021-12-20T05:40:59Z","closed_at":"2021-12-20T05:40:05Z","merged_at":"2021-12-20T05:40:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"3d7557b0c44a5cfb84af8bd6cee0cb11407443b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9442/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9442/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9442/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/68f2077f8e9043cecd208e91c5e100ca298330ad","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/shutdown_codec_extension_null","ref":"fix/shutdown_codec_extension_null","sha":"68f2077f8e9043cecd208e91c5e100ca298330ad","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-17T07:58:20Z","updated_at":"2021-12-18T07:40:32Z","closed_at":"2021-12-17T08:20:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d1bf9d4279d3cb5344fcb285e41f33fc71752014","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9438/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9438/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9438/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ca03245da2f1ec31b1a62c57711b324e3225984b","head":{"label":"zhangshaoning1:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"ca03245da2f1ec31b1a62c57711b324e3225984b","user":{"login":"zhangshaoning1","id":32099766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDk5NzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32099766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangshaoning1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":439253390,"node_id":"R_kgDOGi55jg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"zhangshaoning1/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhangshaoning1","id":32099766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDk5NzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32099766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangshaoning1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangshaoning1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhangshaoning1/dubbo","description":"Apache

certain non-default configurations. This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a denial of service (DOS) attack. Log4j 2.15.0 makes a best-effort attempt to restrict JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default. Log4j 2.16.0 fixes this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-16T16:14:33Z","updated_at":"2021-12-23T07:51:23Z","closed_at":"2021-12-17T01:17:12Z","merged_at":"2021-12-17T01:17:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"a489ad911152b22aded41cba6e7b01751c74cdb3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9431/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9431/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9431/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5747bd0d767a69ef8ec2f4872f441dbe2ce6da84","head":{"label":"pinxiong:download-zookeeper","ref":"download-zookeeper","sha":"5747bd0d767a69ef8ec2f4872f441dbe2ce6da84","user":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349733065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk3MzMwNjU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"pinxiong/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-16T06:07:35Z","updated_at":"2021-12-22T08:14:50Z","closed_at":"2021-12-22T08:14:50Z","merged_at":"2021-12-22T08:14:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"badd3654c8aac6d1509da6b439a931a1e7d08d87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9429/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9429/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9429/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0a7094621b3c02d0092746959511df5e7beb8be6","head":{"label":"BurningCN:fix_MetadaReportConfig_key_map_error","ref":"fix_MetadaReportConfig_key_map_error","sha":"0a7094621b3c02d0092746959511df5e7beb8be6","user":{"login":"BurningCN","id":43363120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzYzMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43363120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN","html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":317421885,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTc0MjE4ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"BurningCN/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BurningCN","id":43363120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzYzMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43363120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN","html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large,

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-15T03:31:14Z","updated_at":"2021-12-15T06:24:11Z","closed_at":"2021-12-15T06:20:37Z","merged_at":"2021-12-15T06:20:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"dc8ba019dcf913c3e8294f4f6a340357eddab787","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9409/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9409/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9409/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/53c3b107cd128762d94fa5a8749bd33b9cce7748","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/shutdown_npe","ref":"fix/shutdown_npe","sha":"53c3b107cd128762d94fa5a8749bd33b9cce7748","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

For example, `testKey=value` will finally have a duplication of `test-key=value` in URL.\r\n\r\nThe following different ways of configurations are supported to add extra parameters:\r\n\r\n1. spring boot `application.properties`\r\n```yaml\r\ndubbo:\r\n  application:\r\n    name: dubbo-springboot-demo-provider\r\n    parameters:\r\n      testKey: value\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. API/XML/Annotation/Spring-boot `dubbo.properties`\r\n```properties\r\ndubbo.registry.parameters=[{testKey:value},{testKey2:value2}]\r\n# or\r\n# dubbo.registry.address=zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181?testKey=value\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. XML\r\n```xml\r\n<dubbo:application name=\"demo-provider\">\r\n    <dubbo:parameter key=\"testKey\" value=\"value\"/>\r\n</dubbo:application>\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-13T13:57:09Z","updated_at":"2021-12-15T03:52:34Z","closed_at":"2021-12-13T13:58:52Z","merged_at":"2021-12-13T13:58:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"c076890107db1e20cc1be49dd939a8f46cacb3dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/47","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/47","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/47/labels","id":7266430,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AbuB-","number":47,"title":"3.0.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":62,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-19T06:11:13Z","updated_at":"2021-12-27T02:18:23Z","due_on":"2021-12-01T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-12-27T02:18:23Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9401/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9401/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9401/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d4e4321e28e8b9811ebae2f555fb6fdc422d359b","head":{"label":"chickenlj:fix-3.0-parameters-camel","ref":"fix-3.0-parameters-camel","sha":"d4e4321e28e8b9811ebae2f555fb6fdc422d359b","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7 \r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-13T06:38:23Z","updated_at":"2021-12-15T07:41:39Z","closed_at":"2021-12-15T06:25:17Z","merged_at":"2021-12-15T06:25:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"9cfb1ae7ac91800f38d147b816c4e0d5ccff75e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/45","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/45","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/45/labels","id":7173371,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AbXT7","number":45,"title":"2.7.15","description":"","creator":{"login":"horizonzy","id":22524871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTI0ODcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22524871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy","html_url":"https://github.com/horizonzy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":22,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-21T01:47:56Z","updated_at":"2022-01-12T03:33:20Z","due_on":"2021-11-10T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-01-12T03:33:20Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9397/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9397/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9397/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d3c83baa9cacf2fe1058e73f94edf5cd63c5fae1","head":{"label":"gitchenjh:master","ref":"master","sha":"d3c83baa9cacf2fe1058e73f94edf5cd63c5fae1","user":{"login":"gitchenjh","id":24949156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTQ5MTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24949156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitchenjh","html_url":"https://github.com/gitchenjh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitchenjh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitchenjh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitchenjh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitchenjh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitchenjh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitchenjh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitchenjh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitchenjh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitchenjh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"7cb6bff60598ff6729f6cf7eab46775f2b4ad305","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-12T12:30:43Z","updated_at":"2021-12-12T15:01:10Z","closed_at":"2021-12-12T15:01:10Z","merged_at":"2021-12-12T15:01:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"dcf25dac8acb15b4119ba4ebe659f55a0d7dcb95","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9392/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9392/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9392/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3f4e780e273f19a3a13e809a727f5eb9a1a726e5","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1212_opt_bit","ref":"1212_opt_bit","sha":"3f4e780e273f19a3a13e809a727f5eb9a1a726e5","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-12T09:39:23Z","updated_at":"2021-12-12T10:09:15Z","closed_at":"2021-12-12T10:00:23Z","merged_at":"2021-12-12T10:00:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"2e271a7a6dec870da737a8c87226b7696bd9c77f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9389/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9389/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9389/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2097a3c9381c2d5f8a081e93751318de58ebbe88","head":{"label":"yyykf:fix_log","ref":"fix_log","sha":"2097a3c9381c2d5f8a081e93751318de58ebbe88","user":{"login":"yyykf","id":24830169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODMwMTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24830169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf","html_url":"https://github.com/yyykf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":429283729,"node_id":"R_kgDOGZZZkQ","name":"dubbo","full_name":"yyykf/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yyykf","id":24830169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODMwMTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24830169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf","html_url":"https://github.com/yyykf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyykf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yyykf/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-12T07:56:51Z","updated_at":"2021-12-12T09:01:06Z","closed_at":"2021-12-12T09:01:06Z","merged_at":"2021-12-12T09:01:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"312dd2b7acc7c365ac330955f3634a2e0bb4c149","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9388/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9388/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9388/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/dfa5d58f53ea39469851eac3b5d75da84778a1c9","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1212_add_opt","ref":"1212_add_opt","sha":"dfa5d58f53ea39469851eac3b5d75da84778a1c9","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-12T06:07:43Z","updated_at":"2021-12-12T07:15:18Z","closed_at":"2021-12-12T07:15:17Z","merged_at":"2021-12-12T07:15:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"304d5ac0ce558eafafb52633331cb2e2010a55aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9386/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9386/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9386/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8e662644c24cb678b7dd84b387ed5d374b773183","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1212_opt_wrapper","ref":"1212_opt_wrapper","sha":"8e662644c24cb678b7dd84b387ed5d374b773183","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-10T15:32:02Z","updated_at":"2021-12-23T07:51:25Z","closed_at":"2021-12-13T02:45:00Z","merged_at":"2021-12-13T02:45:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"7cb6bff60598ff6729f6cf7eab46775f2b4ad305","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9378/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9378/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9378/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/dfafc0d0932bb97f56e71d787a020707ed6c4306","head":{"label":"pinxiong:log4j-bug-2.7.x-fixes","ref":"log4j-bug-2.7.x-fixes","sha":"dfafc0d0932bb97f56e71d787a020707ed6c4306","user":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349733065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk3MzMwNjU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"pinxiong/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong/dubbo","description":"Apache

Update the version of log4j-api and log4j-core to 2.15.0\r\n2. Exclude the log4j-api in spring-boot\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-10T13:56:50Z","updated_at":"2021-12-23T07:51:28Z","closed_at":"2021-12-13T02:24:39Z","merged_at":"2021-12-13T02:24:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"dd539ce4b45fe367d8e1f9005d27a260b85ab56b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/45","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/45","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/45/labels","id":7173371,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AbXT7","number":45,"title":"2.7.15","description":"","creator":{"login":"horizonzy","id":22524871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTI0ODcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22524871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy","html_url":"https://github.com/horizonzy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":22,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-21T01:47:56Z","updated_at":"2022-01-12T03:33:20Z","due_on":"2021-11-10T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-01-12T03:33:20Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9377/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9377/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9377/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/45adadd4f4253793df1a4970dfe12416c35df35b","head":{"label":"pinxiong:log4j-bug-fixes","ref":"log4j-bug-fixes","sha":"45adadd4f4253793df1a4970dfe12416c35df35b","user":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349733065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk3MzMwNjU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"pinxiong/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong/dubbo","description":"Apache

start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-10T09:25:37Z","updated_at":"2021-12-10T13:15:48Z","closed_at":"2021-12-10T13:15:47Z","merged_at":"2021-12-10T13:15:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"437c1e9479ed516be8a73ac7a6014c6c46be597b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9375/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9375/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9375/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/71940359d1122a88c86619a8676d94dd916bcfa1","head":{"label":"EarthChen:bugfix/encode-grpc-message","ref":"bugfix/encode-grpc-message","sha":"71940359d1122a88c86619a8676d94dd916bcfa1","user":{"login":"EarthChen","id":20179425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20179425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen","html_url":"https://github.com/EarthChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"78fd4545155c9f5c14f4d3f087c2f4cc4d1ee0de","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it).

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-06T01:43:07Z","updated_at":"2021-12-06T01:46:37Z","closed_at":"2021-12-06T01:46:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9355/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9355/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9355/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ebe225a32dcf04f1769a5b41f56aaa06bbce3570","head":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ebe225a32dcf04f1769a5b41f56aaa06bbce3570","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-05T13:41:22Z","updated_at":"2021-12-06T02:16:15Z","closed_at":"2021-12-06T02:16:10Z","merged_at":"2021-12-06T02:16:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"3b0038ba85510784f9ad1f2eece0c6257ba5e10f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9353/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9353/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9353/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ea301702ecab1d494cd95429174ddca216bdbb71","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/size","ref":"fix/size","sha":"ea301702ecab1d494cd95429174ddca216bdbb71","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-02T09:29:47Z","updated_at":"2021-12-02T11:11:49Z","closed_at":"2021-12-02T11:11:49Z","merged_at":"2021-12-02T11:11:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"503563be32e0374d75ee0988f3fce0243c46c856","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9345/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9345/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9345/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/99916ad56ab1a4d293fc641eb0bfda8b32d51fe6","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1202_revert_log","ref":"1202_revert_log","sha":"99916ad56ab1a4d293fc641eb0bfda8b32d51fe6","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-30T06:57:54Z","updated_at":"2021-12-01T02:05:02Z","closed_at":"2021-12-01T02:05:02Z","merged_at":"2021-12-01T02:05:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"43d46d9d9e5037b1c89c2a27734b33c01bb6eca5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9331/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9331/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9331/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1ef4c3267e3ae8b2be36bbf35b9a87ab8fed586b","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1130_opt_instance","ref":"1130_opt_instance","sha":"1ef4c3267e3ae8b2be36bbf35b9a87ab8fed586b","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-23T11:53:35Z","updated_at":"2021-12-23T02:27:08Z","closed_at":"2021-12-23T02:27:08Z","merged_at":"2021-12-23T02:27:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"e6df49f243d572330f914f319ae582792a2de4a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9312/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9312/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9312/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3864f181f48c27d544d7b9857a3b0abe1bae8c21","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1025_refactor_mesh","ref":"1025_refactor_mesh","sha":"3864f181f48c27d544d7b9857a3b0abe1bae8c21","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nOptimize the code on global zookeeper\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Avoid compiling pattern every time\r\n2. Avoid port already in use\r\n3. Output all configuration information of global zookeeper instances\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-21T12:30:54Z","updated_at":"2021-12-23T07:51:58Z","closed_at":"2021-11-28T08:39:04Z","merged_at":"2021-11-28T08:39:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"98c86024160ea31fd450cb86fefc4a7da9208420","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9302/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9302/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9302/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8edbd8ae71ab4f870a69d3e4c1abbf63c3ca250e","head":{"label":"pinxiong:optmization","ref":"optmization","sha":"8edbd8ae71ab4f870a69d3e4c1abbf63c3ca250e","user":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349733065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk3MzMwNjU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"pinxiong/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorrect.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-17T14:18:02Z","updated_at":"2021-12-15T07:12:12Z","closed_at":"2021-12-15T06:53:19Z","merged_at":"2021-12-15T06:53:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"4599ed438d76d3508541a951793f55f7451c58f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/47","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/47","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/47/labels","id":7266430,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AbuB-","number":47,"title":"3.0.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":62,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-19T06:11:13Z","updated_at":"2021-12-27T02:18:23Z","due_on":"2021-12-01T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-12-27T02:18:23Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9290/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9290/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9290/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/77fb83d9d03b8670659d2d8440050fb2ea9e69bb","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/instance_url_scope","ref":"fix/instance_url_scope","sha":"77fb83d9d03b8670659d2d8440050fb2ea9e69bb","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-16T07:56:38Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T09:53:27Z","closed_at":"2021-11-16T09:53:27Z","merged_at":"2021-11-16T09:53:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"858f8a95a2197337d0dea1c87508384ad525a281","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9282/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9282/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9282/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/58c96241f7d289e8503f42c6d8da3976e807ab95","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1116_opt","ref":"1116_opt","sha":"58c96241f7d289e8503f42c6d8da3976e807ab95","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-16T05:50:43Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T23:27:32Z","closed_at":"2021-11-16T07:23:13Z","merged_at":"2021-11-16T07:23:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"4fa0aa59b6d7f614b2dfc97048369b067a41fbe9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9281/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9281/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9281/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ef5881bf282875c50d342315d3cc733a8b182aa9","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/revert_demo_zk_config","ref":"fix/revert_demo_zk_config","sha":"ef5881bf282875c50d342315d3cc733a8b182aa9","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-14T16:14:08Z","updated_at":"2021-11-21T08:26:09Z","closed_at":"2021-11-18T14:02:38Z","merged_at":"2021-11-18T14:02:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"fa675d4723dc239fcf05754408d4fbb3c9e27828","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9274/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9274/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9274/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9db2c81eb1cf596e7c2cd0d8c950030b2ce3b4ef","head":{"label":"pinxiong:fix-download","ref":"fix-download","sha":"9db2c81eb1cf596e7c2cd0d8c950030b2ce3b4ef","user":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349733065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk3MzMwNjU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"pinxiong/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong/dubbo","description":"Apache
