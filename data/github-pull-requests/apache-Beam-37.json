metrics are needed as a part of an internal project for thread scaling.\r\nThe outstanding bundles and bytes will provide signals for how we want to autoscale the workers. The outstanding bundles tracks how many bundles of work are currently being processed (currently very similar to number of active threads). The outstanding bytes tracks how many bytes are currently being processed. These two can be compared to the respective limits to see if the pipeline needs to be scaled up or down.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

internal tests, tar ball is created by copybara and it doesn't include gen_protos.py. In the PR https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/28385, we provide hard RuntimeError when error originates from gen_protos.py. By pass the error when gen_protos is not found. \r\n\r\nFYI, externally built sdist contains gen_protos.py but for internal imports, we don't. Since it is a build time dependency for building proto files, it is not necessary to raise RuntimeError while installing tar ball using `pip install <>.tar.gz`\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

outputs artifacts in the output dictionary. Initially, it was designed to provide users artifacts such as `min` and `max` values from the transform `ScaleTo01`. Now since the concept of artifact location is used, we store the artifacts directly in the artifact location and provide the user the option of `read_artifact_location` in MLTransform. \r\n\r\nIn the efforts of read and write artifact location, let us remove outputting artifacts in the output dict since they might create noise in the user data. This is a breaking change but since MLTransform is not yet launched and possibly, there is no usage yet, I would like to mention this in CHANGES.md and merge the breaking changes.\r\n\r\nNote: The artifacts are embedded in a TF graph and it is easier to read and use them with MLTransform. \r\n\r\n\r\nFiled https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/29017 to export MLTransform artifacts in human readable format along with TF graph.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Issue\r\n----------------\r\nThe python SDK requires users specify a unique label for every transform. Often times, the first time a transform is applied there is a default label that will be unique, but any future applications of the transform will require that the user specify a new and unique label. This can be quite tedious since there are many (?) scenarios where a user won't actually care about the labels. A couple scenarios that came up in my experience:\r\n\r\n- Writing unit tests with multiple `assert_that()`s requires unique label for each assert\r\n- Writing a pipeline that branches and applies the same transform to each branch\r\n- Writing a linear pipeline where I want to reuse the same transform (e.g. `LogElements` or `Deduplicate`)\r\n\r\nChange Summary\r\n------------------\r\nThis change adds a new `--auto_unique_labels` standard option. The option defaults to off so there's no change in the default behavior. If the option is set, then whenever a transform is applied with a non-unique label, a new label is generated that includes an automatically incremented suffix. For example, if `Deduplicate` is applied twice, then the second deduplicate will have a label of `Deduplicate_1`. Additional `Deduplicates` would have a label of `Deduplicate_n`.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n-------\r\nWrote a new unit test that tests the new behavior. The rest of the `pipeline_test.py` tests still pass except for one: `test_display_data`. It also fails on my fork's master though so I'm assuming it's unrelated (EDIT: confirmed unrelated, it's just failing b/c it doesn't expect the URN to change when `pipeline_test.py` is invoked directly, in which case the URN references `__main__`)\r\n\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master
