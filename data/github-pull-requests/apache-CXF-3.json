href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.6 - 29 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2449\">#2449</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.5 - 23 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where the <code>csrutil</code> system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2441\">#2441</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.4 - 21 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> The <code>add-snippets</code> input on the <code>analyze</code> Action is deprecated and will be removed in the first release in August 2025. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2436\">#2436</a></li>\n<li>Fix an issue where the disk usage system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled, and then surface a warning.

There are no new standard language features,\nbut a couple of preview language features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/455\">JEP 455: Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch (Preview)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/476\">JEP 476: Module Import Declarations (Preview)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/477\">JEP 477: Implicitly Declared Classes and Instance Main Methods (Third Preview)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/482\">JEP 482: Flexible Constructor Bodies (Second Preview)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that String Templates (introduced as preview in Java 21 and 22) are not supported anymore in Java 23,\nsee <a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8329949\">JDK-8329949</a> for details.</p>\n<p>In order to analyze a project with PMD that uses these preview language features,\nyou'll need to enable it via the environment variable <code>PMD_JAVA_OPTS</code> and select the new language\nversion <code>23-preview</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview\npmd check --use-version java-23-preview ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: Support for Java 21 preview language features have been removed.

There are no new standard language features,\nbut a couple of preview language features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/455\">JEP 455: Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch (Preview)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/476\">JEP 476: Module Import Declarations (Preview)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/477\">JEP 477: Implicitly Declared Classes and Instance Main Methods (Third Preview)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/482\">JEP 482: Flexible Constructor Bodies (Second Preview)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that String Templates (introduced as preview in Java 21 and 22) are not supported anymore in Java 23,\nsee <a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8329949\">JDK-8329949</a> for details.</p>\n<p>In order to analyze a project with PMD that uses these preview language features,\nyou'll need to enable it via the environment variable <code>PMD_JAVA_OPTS</code> and select the new language\nversion <code>23-preview</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview\npmd check --use-version java-23-preview ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: Support for Java 21 preview language features have been removed. The version &quot;21-preview&quot;\nare no longer available.</p>\n<h3>🌟 New Rules</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The new Java rule <a href=\"https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.5.0/pmd_rules_java_multithreading.html#avoidsynchronizedstatement\"><code>AvoidSynchronizedStatement</code></a> finds synchronization blocks that\ncould cause performance issues with virtual threads due to pinning.</li>\n<li>The new JavaScript rule <a href=\"https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.5.0/pmd_rules_ecmascript_performance.html#avoidconsolestatements\"><code>AvoidConsoleStatements</code></a> finds any function calls\non the Console API (e.g. <code>console.log</code>). Using these in production code might negatively impact performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🐛 Fixed Issues</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>apex-performance</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.5 - 23 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where the <code>csrutil</code> system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2441\">#2441</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.4 - 21 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> The <code>add-snippets</code> input on the <code>analyze</code> Action is deprecated and will be removed in the first release in August 2025. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2436\">#2436</a></li>\n<li>Fix an issue where the disk usage system call used for telemetry would fail on MacOS ARM machines with System Integrity Protection disabled, and then surface a warning. The system call is now disabled for these machines. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2434\">#2434</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.3 - 19 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where the CodeQL Action could not write diagnostic messages on Windows. This issue did not impact analysis quality. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2430\">#2430</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.2 - 14 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2417\">#2417</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.1 - 13 Aug 2024</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.0 - 06 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> Swift analysis on Ubuntu runner images is no longer supported. Please migrate to a macOS runner if this affects you. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2403\">#2403</a></li>\n<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2408\">#2408</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.15 - 26 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2385\">#2385</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.14 - 25 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Experimental: add a new <code>start-proxy</code> action which starts the same HTTP proxy as used by <a href=\"https://github.com/github/dependabot-action\"><code>github/dependabot-action</code></a>. Do not use this in production as it is part of an internal experiment and subject to change at any time. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2376\">#2376</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.13 - 19 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>codeql-version</code> to outputs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2368\">#2368</a></li>\n<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.13.4 and earlier.

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.2 - 14 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2417\">#2417</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.1 - 13 Aug 2024</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.0 - 06 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> Swift analysis on Ubuntu runner images is no longer supported.

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.0 - 06 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> Swift analysis on Ubuntu runner images is no longer supported. Please migrate to a macOS runner if this affects you. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2403\">#2403</a></li>\n<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2408\">#2408</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.15 - 26 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2385\">#2385</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.14 - 25 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Experimental: add a new <code>start-proxy</code> action which starts the same HTTP proxy as used by <a href=\"https://github.com/github/dependabot-action\"><code>github/dependabot-action</code></a>. Do not use this in production as it is part of an internal experiment and subject to change at any time. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2376\">#2376</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.13 - 19 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>codeql-version</code> to outputs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2368\">#2368</a></li>\n<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.13.4 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 9 July 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.26.0 and later and versions 2.26.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2375\">#2375</a>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.13.5 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.12.6 and 2.13.4, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.25.13</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.25.13</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.12 - 12 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the reliability and performance of analyzing code when analyzing a compiled language with the <code>autobuild</code> <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#codeql-build-modes\">build mode</a> on GitHub Enterprise Server.

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.15 - 26 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2385\">#2385</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.14 - 25 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Experimental: add a new <code>start-proxy</code> action which starts the same HTTP proxy as used by <a href=\"https://github.com/github/dependabot-action\"><code>github/dependabot-action</code></a>. Do not use this in production as it is part of an internal experiment and subject to change at any time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.13 - 19 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>codeql-version</code> to outputs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2368\">#2368</a></li>\n<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.13.4 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 9 July 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.26.0 and later and versions 2.26.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2375\">#2375</a>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.13.5 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.12.6 and 2.13.4, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.25.13</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.25.13</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.12 - 12 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the reliability and performance of analyzing code when analyzing a compiled language with the <code>autobuild</code> <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#codeql-build-modes\">build mode</a> on GitHub Enterprise Server. This feature is already available to GitHub.com users. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2353\">#2353</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.0. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2364\">#2364</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.11 - 28 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid failing the workflow run if there is an error while uploading debug artifacts. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2349\">#2349</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.6. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2352\">#2352</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.10 - 13 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2327\">#2327</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.9 - 12 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid failing database creation if the database folder already exists and contains some unexpected files.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF-9042\r\n\r\n# The Problem\r\n\r\n\r\nSome unit tests are non-idempotent, as they pass in the first run but fail in the second run in the same environment. A fix is necessary since unit tests shall be self-contained, ensuring that the state of the system under test is consistent at the beginning of each test. In practice, fixing non-idempotent tests can help proactively avoid state pollution that results in test order dependency (which could cause problems under test selection, prioritization or parallelization).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Reproduce\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the `NIOInspector` plugin that supports rerunning JUnit tests in the same environment. Use `org.apache.cxf.management.InstrumentationManagerTest#testWorkQueueInstrumentation` as an example:\r\n```\r\ncd rt/management\r\nmvn edu.illinois:NIOInspector:rerun -Dtest=org.apache.cxf.management.InstrumentationManagerTest#testWorkQueueInstrumentation\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# 3 Non-Idempotent Tests & Proposed Fix\r\n## org.apache.cxf.management.InstrumentationManagerTest#testWorkQueueInstrumentation\r\nReason: The test creates and registers `MBean`s in the `MBeanServer` every time it runs, but it does not properly clean up those `MBean`s after the test execution. As a result, when the test is repeatedly run in the same environment, the number of `MBean`s registered with the `MBeanServer` accumulates, causing `s.size()` to increase.\r\n\r\n\r\nError message of the test in the repeated run:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<2> but was:<4>\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:89)\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:835)\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:647)\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:633)\r\n\tat org.apache.cxf.management.InstrumentationManagerTest.testWorkQueueInstrumentation(InstrumentationManagerTest.java:91)\r\n```\r\nFix: Unregister `MBean`s at the end of the test.\r\n\r\n\r\n## org.apache.cxf.sts.operation.ValidateJWTTransformationTest#testJWTToSAMLTransformationRealm\r\nReason: The line `wrapper = (Element) doc.getDocumentElement().appendChild(wrapper);` is not idempotent. This is because each time this line is executed, it attempts to append the wrapper element to the document's root element. If the wrapper element has already been appended to the root (as done in a previous test run), attempting to append it again will violate the document's tree structure, resulting in `org.w3c.dom.DOMException`.\r\n\r\nError message in the repeated run:\r\n```\r\norg.w3c.dom.DOMException: HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: An attempt was made to insert a node where it is not permitted.\r\n\tat java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.dom.CoreDocumentImpl.insertBefore(CoreDocumentImpl.java:439)\r\n\tat java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.dom.NodeImpl.appendChild(NodeImpl.java:230)\r\n\tat org.apache.cxf.sts.operation.ValidateJWTTransformationTest.testJWTToSAMLTransformationRealm(ValidateJWTTransformationTest.java:209)\r\n```\r\nFix: Add a checker to avoid appending the `wrapper` if it is already part of the document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## org.apache.cxf.systest.dispatch.DispatchClientServerTest#testJAXBObjectPAYLOADWithFeature\r\nReason: The static counters in `TestDispatchFeature` and `TestInInterceptor` gets incremented repeatedly when `testJAXBObjectPAYLOADWithFeature()` is repeatedly run. The counters will be 1 in the first test run, but will be 2 in the second run and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nError message  in the repeated run:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: Feature should be applied expected:<1> but was:<2>\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:89)\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:835)\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:647)\r\n\tat org.apache.cxf.systest.dispatch.DispatchClientServerTest.testJAXBObjectPAYLOADWithFeature(DispatchClientServerTest.java:691)\r\n```\r\nFix:  Save the initial counts of the `TestDispatchFeature` before creating the bus, and then comparing the increments in the assertion checks.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Verifying this change\r\nAfter the patch, running the tests repeatedly in the same environment will not lead

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.13 - 19 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>codeql-version</code> to outputs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2368\">#2368</a></li>\n<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.13.4 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 9 July 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.26.0 and later and versions 2.26.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2375\">#2375</a>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.13.5 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.12.6 and 2.13.4, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.25.13</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.25.13</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.12 - 12 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the reliability and performance of analyzing code when analyzing a compiled language with the <code>autobuild</code> <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#codeql-build-modes\">build mode</a> on GitHub Enterprise Server.

Requires CodeQL 2.18.0 or higher. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2330\">#2330</a></li>\n<li>The init Action will attempt to clean up the database cluster directory before creating a new database and at the end of the job. This will help to avoid issues where the database cluster directory is left in an inconsistent state. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2332\">#2332</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.8 - 04 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2321\">#2321</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.7 - 31 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in May/June 2024 that will reduce the Actions cache usage of the Action by keeping only the newest TRAP cache for each language. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2306\">#2306</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.6 - 20 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2295\">#2295</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.5 - 13 May 2024</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
