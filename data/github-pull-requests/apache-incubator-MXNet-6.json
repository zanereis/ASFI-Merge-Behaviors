Description ##\r\nOptimizers in MXNet2.0 are refactored and some have new keyword name for the parameters, like adagrad(eps->epsilon), rmsprop(gamma1->rho, gamma2->momentum). It will be confusing for users who migrate from v1.x to find that using rmsprop could raise the following error: \r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"optimizer_update.py\", line 16, in <module>\r\n    rmsprop_optimizer = optimizer.RMSProp(learning_rate=0.001, gamma1=0.9, gamma2=0.9, epsilon=1e-07, centered=False)\r\n  File

Description ##\r\nThis pull-request contains a small replacement of standard std::unorder_map by a parallel hashmap. The parallel hashmap has lower space requirements and might be used from multiple threads with high levels of concurrency. \r\n\r\n### What is new here: ###\r\n1. Parallel-hash map was added to 3rdparty\r\n2. For OneDNN files, std::unorderd_map was replaced by a flat hashmap\r\n\r\n## How to measure ##\r\nBasically: ways used to measure the impact on (a few of them), as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The first thing to measure is memory consumption. \r\n2. Performance for NLP models: i.e BERT\r\n\r\n## Memory consumption: settings ##\r\n1. Total bytes used for element storage: `__container__.size() * sizeof(M::type)`\r\n2. Total byers used for the flat_hash_table bucket:  `__container__ .bucket_count()* sizeof(M::type)`\r\n\r\n### Memory consumption: results [1] ### \r\n- Model: BERT\r\n- Operator: mkldnn_fully_connected\r\n\r\n```\r\n Case           Before        After\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nTable bucket       39760        **28672 \r\n```\r\n ** This container uses almost `O(sizeof(M::type) + 1) + __container__ .bucket_count()` bytes\r\n\r\n## Perfroamcne results [2] ##\r\n```\r\n Case                    After\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\nCase [Infrence BERT]      [0.5 - 1]% \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-08T14:33:28Z","updated_at":"2021-12-30T12:48:07Z","closed_at":"2021-12-30T12:48:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d1cac9edbe4b2c8c3813dbd5356484fdf824b274","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\n[Performance optimization] . This pull-request aims in the cpu-memory allocator. Typically, the size of a memory page is 4 KB. However, the modern operating system is able to support 2MB memory pages. This may improve performance results on a CPU in some scenarios. \r\n\r\n# How to measure? \r\nBasically: ways were used to measure the impact (a few of them), as following:\r\n1. The first thing to measure is the number of TLB misses\r\n2. The second thing to measure is the number of TLB misses\r\n3. How much those misses cost for the CPU.\r\n\r\n* Setting: Let’s turn the THP on.\r\n\r\n# Result #\r\nModel: Resent50\r\nPlatform: CPU\r\nType: inference [CAPI] \r\n\r\n## After ##\r\n### Perf: event

packages from CentOS SCLo RH repository, which gives `gcc`/`g++`/`gfortran-10.2` allowing us to use `-moutline-atomics` C/C++ build flag, and `numpy-v1.17.3` which helps pass unittests which were failing earlier https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/20289.\r\n\r\nWe continue to use ArmPL built with `gcc-8` as ArmPL built with `gcc-10` requires some `gfortran-10` symbols that are not present in `devtoolset-10` as it is a patched version.\r\n\r\nThe changes have been tested on a test CD pipeline and it passes for all flavors:

Description ##\r\nSolve https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/20371\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- When the input's shape=(), the backward log_sigmoid activation is incorrect\r\n\r\n    - Reason: For `y = log_sigmoid(x)`, the inputs for `log_sigmoid_grad` is `(dy, y)`. This problem is similar to https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10868\r\n\r\n- There is an error when run the log_sigmoid in gpu.\r\n\r\n    - Reason: There is no cudnn log_sigmoid implement in `cudnn_activation-inl.h`\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/da4ff3a4dc0bd6a54af3d75c492021d18ba1867b/src/operator/nn/cudnn/cudnn_activation-inl.h#L48-L65","created_at":"2021-06-22T14:07:13Z","updated_at":"2021-06-30T01:38:34Z","closed_at":"2021-06-30T01:38:34Z","merged_at":"2021-06-30T01:38:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"cb5bd4ea8b6fc9b568c13747bdb006ac047b72b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes slowdown on CI (https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/20092) introduced after removing 3rdparty/openmp.\r\n\r\nGOMP by default doesn't use OMP_DYNAMIC and OMP_NESTED which allows to run parallel regions inside other parallel region.\r\ne.g.\r\n```\r\n#pragma omp parallel for\r\nfor(int i .....) {\r\n    do_sth()...\r\n    #pragma omp parallel for\r\n    for(int i ....) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nEven if there is \"**if**\" directive causing sequential run it's still treated as parallel region - setting OMP_DYNAMIC and OMP_NESTED somewhat helps, but seems that without \"**if**\" clause in GOMP we get even better performance and we don't need to set above env variables.\r\n\r\nCC: @akarbown \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title

Description ##\r\n\r\nTensor shapes can be interpreted in one of two modes, depending on whether \"numpy shape semantics\" have been enabled.  There are unittests that test shape handling in both modes, but any one unittest should not make assumptions about the prevailing mode entering the test, nor should it permanently alter the mode for tests that follow (regardless of whether the test passes or fails).  **This PR fixes the test_operator.py::test_zero_sized_dim test, which was leaving numpy shape semantics set for follow-on tests.**  Running the test was found to cause failures in a following test_sparse_ndarray.py::def test_sparse_nd_pickle among other tests, as reported in issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/20337.  This PR also fixes test_operator.py::test_boolean_mask and test_thread_local.py::test_np_global_shape, which do not properly save and restore the pre-test shape interpretation mode.\r\n\r\nWhen running pytest with xdist and multiple workers, I'm not sure if the same set of tests are run on the same workers.  If the assignment of tests to workers is non-deterministic, then failures of susceptible tests may be non-deterministic.  In that case, this PR may also fix the non-deterministic issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/19915.\r\n\r\nRegarding implementation, I chose not to use the more elegant np_shape() or use_np_shape() decorators in fixing these tests.  Instead, I kept the use of set_np_shape() in order to retain some direct testing of this function from the unittests.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ X] PR's title starts with a

pr forward ports all the new mx2onnx changes in v1.9.x (or v1.x as of 06/15/2020) and deprecates onnx2mx as discussed in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/20063.\r\n\r\nThe expectation is that models generated with and exportable by MXNet v1.x should be continue to be able to export fine with MXNet 2.0.\r\n\r\nDone:\r\n1. forward-port mx2onnx\r\n2. add operator tests (onnx updated to v1.8, onnxruntime updated to v1.7)\r\n3. add one model test (resnet 50)\r\n4.  check mx2onnx wheel generation\r\n\r\nTODO in future prs:\r\n1. identify new np and npx operators that need new conversion functions\r\n2. forward port gluoncv/gluonnlp model tests once they are compatible with MXNet 2.0\r\n\r\n--------------\r\nupdate on 06/30/2021\r\nSince this pr https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/commit/71526851d857fde97660aa79ccdb77f2b1cf963f MXNet 2.0 is steering toward the new Gluon 2.0 interface and np and npx operators.

Description ##\r\nThis proposal of using the pytest-parallel plugin could be the temporary WA for the slowdown in the tests (#20092) after removal of LLVM OpenMP. \r\nUsing pytest-parallel plugin (instead of pytest-xdist):  \r\n- needs the WA connected with python described [here](https://bugs.python.org/issue38904). Thus, the '--timeout-method=thread' option appeared in the command line and the fixes in the dataloader.py file.\r\n- might result in the deadlocks, as some of the tests may not be thread safe. The one I've encountered is i.e test_ndarray_saveload and this is why I've mark that test as serial. There might be some others but it needs definitely longer testing. \r\n- make the tests run faster than when using pytest-xdist.\r\n\r\nFor now, it's only the draft that will check/test that fix in the production. In the next steps I'll try to find the root-cause of the slowdown when MxNET is compiled with GNU OpenMP.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nWhere can I find any installation guide or other documentation that needs mentioning that change? I'm asking as I couldn't find

Description ##\r\nChanges how the GPU operations are synced in the `ThreadedEngine`.\r\n\r\nGPU operators needed to be completed so the output variables (either `NDArray` or Resource) could be tagged as readable. The engine workers needed to `cudaStreamSynchronize` on the GPU stream to know when the variable is ready to read. This prevented an optimal GPU kernels overlapping with CPU operations.  \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a sync mechanism which leverages `cudaEvent` to avoid host synchronization between GPU operations. \r\nThe GPU writing operators tag the variables with a `cudaEvent` based sync object, and the operators reading the variables sync or wait on these objects.\r\n\r\n## Illustration ##\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-06-04 at 17 10 43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3193578/120769260-cb1fcd00-c4d1-11eb-9d11-d96d9a01e114.png)\r\n\r\n## Note ###\r\nUse the `MXNET_ENGINE_TYPE` environment variable to enable the new async engine feature, by adding `Async` at the end of the engine type:\r\n```\r\nThreadedEngine -> ThreadedEngineAsync\r\nThreadedEnginePerDevice -> ThreadedEnginePerDeviceAsync\r\n```\r\nWhen not set, the GPU operations synchronization will be done as previously: with a host-device synchronization after the op function.\r\n\r\n## Detailed changes\r\n\r\nThe changes primarily concern the `ThreadedEnginePerDevice` and the `ThreadedEnginePooled`.\r\n\r\n#### Removing synchronization\r\nThis PR removes all the stream synchronizations that used to be called after the operator function, such as `rctx.get_stream<gpu>()->Wait();`.\r\n\r\n#### SyncObject\r\nA new structure, `SyncObject` is added to the engine variable. It carries the CUDA events used to defer the data dependency to the CUDA Driver.\r\nTherefore, each variable (`NDArray` or `Resource`) handled by the engine owns a `SyncObject`.\r\n\r\nThere are two categories of events, the reader events and writer events.\r\n\r\nA sync object can have 0 or more reader events: several operators might be waiting to read this `Variable`.\r\nHowever, it can carry only 0 or 1 writer event: only one writer can be writing on the variable at a time.\r\n\r\n#### New functions: OnCompleteGPU, OnStartGPU and OnStartCPU\r\nPreviously, an OnComplete callback would be called by the engine worker right after executing the op function. Its main purpose was to set the data dependency. This PR adds a new OnComplete overrides and another callback type, the on\r\n3 new hooks were added:\r\n- `OnCompleteGPU`. The existing OnComplete callback has new a new version, the OnCompleteGPU. This functions captures the kernels scheduled on the stream in an event, and assigns it to the SyncObject of each variable. \r\n\r\n- `OnStartGPU`: this hook is called before GPU op functions and will iterate through all the events of variables read and written by the function. It calls cudaStreamWaitEvent to guarantee that all the needed variables will be ready before the current function's kernels are scheduled.\r\n\r\n- `OnStartCPU`: this hook acts similarly as the previous one, but it is called before GPU op functions and it uses host-device synchronisation with `cudaEventSynchronize`.\r\n\r\nThese changes result in a new signature for the `Engine`'s async function:\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\n  typedef std::function<void(RunContext, CallbackOnStart, CallbackOnComplete)> AsyncFn;\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n  typedef std::function<void(RunContext, CallbackOnStart)> AsyncFn;\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### CUDAEventPool\r\nThe events are managed by a `CUDAEventPool` that contains a counter. This is needed both for performance and to track the event order.\r\nIn the `ThreadedEnginePerDevice`, there is one pool per worker. In the `ThreadedEnginePooled`, there is a one `ThreadedEnginePooled` per stream, owned by the stream manager.\r\n\r\n#### Pooled allocator\r\nThe `PooledStorageManager` is also aware of the sync objects in order to recycle them with the data `Chunk`. The `free` function now also recycles the SyncObject, which can be later synchronized at `alloc` time. \r\n\r\n#### WaitAll, WaitToRead and WaitToWrite updated\r\nThe `NDArray` synchronisation method `WaitAll`, `WaitToRead` and `WaitToWrite` now call `cudaEventSynchronize` to guarantee that the GPU data is ready.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Re-enable the byteps test, once byteps is updated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCo-author: @ptrendx

Description ##\r\nIn order to get the advantage of LSE support while supporting all AArch64 platforms, we used gcc-10 on u18 base docker image as it supports the build flag `-moutline-atomics`. But using gcc-10 also creates a dependency of generated MXNet wheel on GLIBCXX_3.4.26, and so we need to upgrade libstdc++6 package on u18 to get the wheel working. On u20, the wheel works fine.\r\n\r\n2 weeks ago gcc-8.5 was launched that added support for the build flag `-moutline-atomics`. Since there is no ubuntu/canonical package for gcc-8.5, I tried building it from source and it works, with the advantage over gcc-10 that we dont need to upgrade libstdc++6 on u18.\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add LSE support to glibc with the package `libc6-lse`.\r\n- [x] Use build flag `-march=armv8-a+crc+crypto` instead of `-march=armv8` earlier to get the benefit of crc and crypto extension.\r\n- [x] Install gcc-8 (gcc-8.4) as openblas build fails with gcc-8.5 and so using gcc-8.4 to build it.\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-27T21:24:21Z","updated_at":"2021-06-01T02:04:54Z","closed_at":"2021-06-01T02:03:54Z","merged_at":"2021-06-01T02:03:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"14d8a9e90a2051c64be23eb9cc4e29d65c95c7de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR introduces a pass that transforms OneDNN operators pair quantize->FC so that oneDNN performs faster u8s8s32 inner_product implementation instead of slower s8s8s32. Currently the speedup is unfortunately not visible possibly because of overhead of extra computation. It might be improved in the future if OneDNN optimizes zero_point in reorder.\r\n\r\nThis is basically doing asymmetric quantization.\r\nThis pass tells the quantize operator to shift the input values to positive and modifies scale so that it uses full uint8 range. To compensate that it is re-calculating the bias (b'=b-shift*w). The bias after the pass is stored in int32 so it is no longer calculated in initial FC forward pass which was beneficial in case of dynamic batching which re-initialized operators. In the image below the shift value of 128 is now changed to min_calib_range.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17185347/118282201-5529d680-b4ce-11eb-96ca-f282b5782698.png)\r\n\r\nThis feature is by default disabled for now and it can be enabled by environment flag `MXNET_DISABLE_SHIFTED_QUANTIZATION=0`.\r\n\r\nThis pass is a gateway to the following next optimizations:\r\nFC->FC\r\nConv->FC\r\nFC->SelfAttn\r\n\r\n## Checklist

Description ##\r\nBackport of #20107 and #20137\r\n\r\n> Currently, deconvolution 2D is implemented with oneDNN convolution primitives. Deconvolution forward pass is implemented with convolution backward primitives that do not include bias. This requires you to manually add the bias, which is currently broken (#19768).\r\n> \r\n> This change implements oneDNN deconvolution primitives to deconvolution, fixing (#19768).\r\n> As I couldn't reproduce (#12579) for the 2D case, I enabled the 2D part of this test.\r\n\r\n> Adds Deconvolution 1D and 3D support with MKLDNN #19904\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n-
