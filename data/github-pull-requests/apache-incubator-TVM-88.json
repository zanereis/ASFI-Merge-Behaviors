previous implementation of task serialization mechanism has a potential problem, which is a bit tricky so I didn't notice that before.\r\n\r\nPreviously, I defined a set of attributes in the Python object (e.g., `hardware_params`) and use them to be the state when serializing a task object in Python. However, in the case that users don't provide `hardware_params`, the SearchTask constructor in C++ invokes `GetDefaultHardwareParams` to get the default hardware parameters. These default hardware parameters aren't exposed to the Python object because of the same name attribute.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't be a bit deal because when a task is deserialized, we follow the same process to get the default hardware parameters. However, since `GetDefaultHardwareParams` may access hardware context (e.g., CUDA context), this prevents tasks from being deserialized in parallel (with multiprocessing).\r\n\r\nThis PR removes all attributes in `SearchTask` Python object to make sure we access the up-to-date C++ object attributes when serializing a task. The only exception is `self.dag` because we need it to reconstruct a ComputeDAG.\r\n\r\ncc @merrymercy @jcf94

current auto_scheduler callbacks can only be implemented in C++. This PR exposes the interface of measure callbacks to Python so that people can plug in their own callback functions easily.\r\n\r\n~~Note: looks like I cannot pass the `SearchPolicy` node to the `PackedFunc`. Specifically, `callback_func(policy, inputs, results);` results in the type mismatching error. This also prevents us from introducing the Python API for `SearchCallback`. Any advise is appreciated.~~\r\n\r\ncc @merrymercy @jcf94

goal of this pull request is to make asymmetric padding a first-class citizen in 2D convolution in TOPI.\r\n\r\nThe current workload description has `\"hpad\"` and `\"wpad\"`, however this is not representative of all of the possible configurations.  Most TOPI conv2d implementations in TVM already support asymmetric padding, so I think this should be reflected in the workload description.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\n\r\nThe process of developing this PR uncovered an additional bug with Conv2D workload definitions, where the output dimensions were not being properly calculated for `fallback_schedule`s.  Both asymmetric padding, and dilation were not being considered properly, which was leading to some untested incorrect behaviour.  For some cases, this could perhaps result in a schedule with a performance regression, but this has not been tested.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-21T21:05:28Z","updated_at":"2020-12-29T23:10:09Z","closed_at":"2020-12-29T23:09:48Z","merged_at":"2020-12-29T23:09:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"cfdbf0eaa52504cc68cad62fd3966bd88e279061","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

investigating GPU NMS performance on MaskRCNN workload, I found that PyTorch NMS can have negative scores in its input. In that case, converted Relay model produces a wrong result for the two reasons:\r\n\r\n* GPU NMS IR treats negative scores as invalid.\r\n* Our frontend is using `get_valid_counts` even though PyTorch doesn't have `score_threshold` parameter. We are arbitrary using -1 as a `score_threshold`, which is not correct.\r\n\r\nThe issue is fixed by adding an offset to the scores appropriately and removing a call to `get_valid_counts`.

spent some time studying GPU NMS implementation in detail, and found a number of possible improvements. I simplified the IR quite a bit, the main NMS routine now consists only of two kernel calls (initialization and the triangle loop). I also removed unnecessary computation and memory movement. I believe what I have now is a much simpler, and faster NMS. \r\n\r\nIn particular, on PyTorch Mask RCNN workload (4900 boxes), this PR cuts more than 1000 micro seconds. This is actually significant because the PyTorch NMS kernel takes only 200 micro seconds. NMS from GluonCV SSD is also faster now by 2x (24 ms -> 12 ms, see blow).\r\n\r\nOur NMS is still super slow for PyTorch models due to the serial triangle loop (`fused_vision_non_max_suppression_kernel2` below):  PyTorch NMS doesn't have topk or `score_threshold`, so we need to take all boxes into account. Optimizing and parallelizing the triangle loop is an important future work that I plan on doing.\r\n\r\nI must admit that some optimization I did in the triangle loop is only possible because we are doing the loop sequentially. If we find a way to parallelize that loop, we need to remove those changes. But until then, I think this is a better approach.\r\n\r\ncc @Laurawly @kevinthesun @mbrookhart @zhiics @vinx13 \r\n\r\nnvprof output from running PyTorch MaskRCNN\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\n

PR builds upon #7128 , adding a test for `is_floating_point()` following masahi's [recommendation](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7128#issuecomment-747862332) to look at `verify_script_model()`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the test, this PR makes the following changes:\r\n\r\n* `verify_script_model()` can now pass a dtype to `verify_model_vm()`\r\n* `verify_model_vm()` can now generate random inputs for bool and int dtypes.\r\n* `verify_model_vm()` includes TVM dtype information in `input_shapes`, providing additional type information to operators such as `is_floating_point()`.\r\n\r\nThese additional changes were made because `verify_model_vm()` does not currently pass type information to `relay.frontend.from_pytorch()`, preventing `is_floating_point()` from working correctly. The changes to random tensor generation were required as `torch.randn()` does not support bool or int dtypes, and my test requires inputs with these dtypes.\r\n\r\nIf it would be helpful, I can split the addition of the test and the changes to testing infrastructure out into two separate PRs.","created_at":"2020-12-18T21:41:04Z","updated_at":"2020-12-22T09:20:50Z","closed_at":"2020-12-22T09:20:37Z","merged_at":"2020-12-22T09:20:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"968b6f60da37d85232af6f9a6070d8ff2ed4be8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7134/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7134/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7134/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/369b72a4c25859dbf33f19b70d2caea759d4e95b","head":{"label":"TylerADavis:tyler_add_ops_incl_tests","ref":"tyler_add_ops_incl_tests","sha":"369b72a4c25859dbf33f19b70d2caea759d4e95b","user":{"login":"TylerADavis","id":16804460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODA0NDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16804460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis","html_url":"https://github.com/TylerADavis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":321786279,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjE3ODYyNzk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"TylerADavis/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TylerADavis","id":16804460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODA0NDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16804460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis","html_url":"https://github.com/TylerADavis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TylerADavis/tvm","description":"Open

noted in issue #7129, the documentation for `relay.stack` suggests it should be able to take a Relay expression that evaluates to a tuple of tensors but in reality only works for tuple literals or a Python list of Relay expressions (that evaluate to tensors). It was, in fact, easy to fix `relay.stack` to work on Relay expressions that evaluate to tuples. I have added test cases to demonstrate this.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate suggestions for further test cases if possible.\r\n\r\nI realize the documentation for `stack` may have been specifically intended to mean that its input should always be a tuple literal, but I think it is reasonable to expect that it should be able to take an expression that evaluates to a tuple as input. (The operator implementation and type relation can handle that just fine.)\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-18T05:05:38Z","updated_at":"2020-12-30T01:43:40Z","closed_at":"2020-12-30T01:43:13Z","merged_at":"2020-12-30T01:43:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"466383a232097b5c17733e347c2cb4a8ba14d972","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7130/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7130/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7130/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/5a9e59437bc795d45e1bf696054818b571493810","head":{"label":"slyubomirsky:correct-stack-binding","ref":"correct-stack-binding","sha":"5a9e59437bc795d45e1bf696054818b571493810","user":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":149190623,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDkxOTA2MjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"slyubomirsky/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky/tvm","description":"Open

for contributing to TVM!   Please refer to guideline https://tvm.apache.org/docs/contribute/ for useful information and tips. After the pull request is submitted, please request code reviews from [Reviewers](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md#reviewers) by @ them in the pull request thread.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for the `is_floating_point` and `div_` PyTorch operations, and closes #6239 .\r\n\r\nThis PR does not include a unit test for `div_` as there is currently no unit test for `div`, and they share an implementation. Additionally, while I wrote a unit test for `is_floating_point()` (see https://github.com/apache/tvm/compare/main...TylerADavis:tyler_add_ops_incl_tests?expand=1), it is not included in this PR as models consisting solely of `is_floating_point` are compiled to constant graphs with no inputs, and the current testing infrastructure assumes that all graphs have inputs. The unit test for `is_floating_point()` tests the operator with `torch.jit.script` and `torch.jit.trace` with inputs consisting of `int8, float64, float32`, and `float16`. Each of these test cases passes.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-18T03:07:55Z","updated_at":"2020-12-18T07:48:51Z","closed_at":"2020-12-18T07:48:29Z","merged_at":"2020-12-18T07:48:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"833f238efc88d3d141c7710a234897da3e07308d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7128/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7128/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7128/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/656b326b2bca18a4bd25b17dd05061de9a86b376","head":{"label":"TylerADavis:tyler_add_ops","ref":"tyler_add_ops","sha":"656b326b2bca18a4bd25b17dd05061de9a86b376","user":{"login":"TylerADavis","id":16804460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODA0NDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16804460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis","html_url":"https://github.com/TylerADavis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":321786279,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjE3ODYyNzk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"TylerADavis/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TylerADavis","id":16804460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODA0NDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16804460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis","html_url":"https://github.com/TylerADavis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerADavis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TylerADavis/tvm","description":"Open

a followup to #6839 , this parallelizes the cumsum in get_valid_counts using an upsweep/downsweep tree-based prefix sum algorithm, similar to what I did in #7099.\r\n\r\nOn my 1070 Ti, testing deploy_ssd_gluoncv.py, I previously reported that get_valid_counts took 3674.62 microseconds this reduces that to ~~495.8~~ 258.497 microseconds.\r\n\r\n@masahi has expressed interest in implementing a more general prefix scan for other ops, as future work I expect we'll refactor this and do possible cache optimization.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\ncc @Laurawly @zhiics @kevinthesun

has shapes associated with each input in the graph. In many cases, there is no need for users to specify those shapes since we can simply pull them out. In the onnx importer today, however, an error is thrown whenever shapes aren't explicitly provided. This PR changes that behavior and should make the importer much more user friendly. If an input shape can be extracted and is static, it does not need to be passed in as a shape dictionary. If there are unknown shapes, the importer will raise a warning but continue assuming they're

@zhiics @icemelon9 @csullivan @tkonolige \r\n\r\nThere have been many complaints recently about stability and performance of the tir-based cuda sort kernel. I've spent a couple of days this week getting a cuda version of Parallel Mergesort. It's a stable sort, so it fixes the flakiness we've seen with argsort and argwhere, it changes the threading to support dynamic shapes, and it increases the performance significantly over the previous kernel.\r\n\r\nThis PR only addresses the core sort_ir function, extending this to other versions sort in this file is future work. \r\n\r\nI tested performance on a variety of shapes using this [script](https://gist.github.com/mbrookhart/c4730cbec48eaa4afcbf86d875847f9f) and obtained these numbers on my 1070TI. It's not as fast as Thrust, as expected, but it's much closer for all shapes tested here, and even manages to beat thrust on a few. (times are in milliseconds)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n| Shape         | main    | thrust | this  |\r\n|---------------|---------|--------|-------|\r\n| (2000, 2, 2)  | 7.77    | 0.58   | 1.67  |\r\n| (2,

relay has separate operators for `reshape` and `reverse_reshape` however in c++ they were both implemented using shared functions. The weird part is that `ReshapeAttrs` has a `reverse` attribute that was used for `reverse_reshape` but not exposed in the python API of `reshape`. This often causes headaches when trying to create a new `reshape` operator in a pass from existing attributes, since python doesn't expect a `reverse` argument. As far as I can tell, there's no reason to have a separate `reverse_reshape` op. Consolidating the two and exposing `reverse` in python leads to a much cleaner and more obvious API without breaking any tests or use cases.","created_at":"2020-12-10T22:12:24Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:55:18Z","closed_at":"2020-12-31T01:29:07Z","merged_at":"2020-12-31T01:29:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"c6b766a4cea4e59384c2606deecdc5321ac3d41c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

PR supports building TIR function directly and allows TIR returns value directly. \r\nCurrent approach is by adding an intrinsic for `return`.  Example:\r\n```python\r\ndef add():\r\n    a = tir.Var(\"a\", \"float32\") \r\n    b = tir.Var(\"b\", \"float32\") \r\n    c = a + b\r\n    c = tir.call_intrin(\"float32\", \"tir.myreturn\", c) \r\n    c = tir.Evaluate(c)\r\n    func = tir.PrimFunc([a, b], c)\r\n    mod = tvm.IRModule({'add': func})\r\n    func = tvm.build(mod['add'])\r\n    out = func(1.0, 2.0)\r\n    print(out)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the future, with the tvm script, we should be able to write some like:\r\n```python\r\n@tvm.script\r\ndef add(a, b):\r\n    tir.myreturn(a + b)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two things need to be discussed:\r\n- Because `return` is a keyword in Python, currently I use `myreturn`, we should have another name for it.\r\n- Whether we should support multiple `return` in a single function.\r\n\r\n@tqchen @junrushao1994 @areusch

recent addition of tensorcore schedules has broken TVM's ability to compile for cuda on a machine without a GPU. This is because the strategy registration for tensorcores calls `tvm.gpu(0).compute_version`, which fails when no gpu is present. I've changed the behavior of `nvcc.have_tensorcore` to check `AutotvmGlobalScope.current.cuda_target_arch` when a GPU isn't present. This allows a user to call something like `tvm.autotvm.measure.measure_methods.set_cuda_target_arch(\"sm_62\")` to specify a cuda cross compilation target on a machine without a GPU and build correctly.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to test this since it would require a CPU node that's built with the cuda toolkit.

is somewhat a follow up to https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7044. As I explained there, the current implementation of CUDA scatter 1D uses only one thread. Inspired by @tkonolige's comment at https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7044#issuecomment-740090664, I came up with the following sorting based approach powered by thrust's ```stable_sort_by_key``` function. I think it enables maximum parallelism while guaranteeing determinism. \r\n\r\n* Sort indices and updates. Updates are sorted using indices as keys. Both sorting can be done in one go via thrust `sort_by_key` function.\r\n* Compare an index at thread i with thread i + 1 in the sorted indices array. If thread i + 1 has a different index, thread i can scatter its update to the output. \r\n* To guarantee deterministic output, sorting must be done via `stable_sort`.\r\n\r\nHere is the timing comparison. As expected, for big inputs a new approach performs much better.\r\n\r\nAll numbers in mili second, measured via time evaluator on GTX 1070 ti\r\n|  size |  current (sequential) | new (powered by

adds a new tir builtin `atomic_add` and corresponding lowering rule for LLVM GPU backends. So far, `atomic_add` is introduced and used by CUDA topi, and LLVM based GPU backend cannot compile ops that use it (`nms`, `scatter_add`, `argwhere`). \r\n\r\nUnfortunately I couldn't get atomic_add working for CPU backend. There is some pointer cast issue that llvm IR verifier rejects. I think it is related to implicit cast to i8* done by LLVM CPU backend, but I haven't looked into details. So for now, only GPU backends support lowering atomic_add.\r\n\r\nOther restriction is I've only supported 32 bit atomics. Supporting int64 atomic would be desirable but it looks complicated (need to generate CAS loop etc).\r\n\r\nObviously I'm a complete noob to atomic issues, any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nplease

pull request adds sparse conv2d implementations to CPU for TOPI.  I have implemented sparse GEMM convolution, and sparse direct convolution for the NCHW data layout, using the CSR sparse data format.\r\n\r\nThe extension to the C++ runtime is pretty stable.  The code for TOPI is not clean or very well integrated yet, but I am looking for some guidance from other developers.\r\n\r\n[This gist](https://gist.github.com/Wheest/94433f73ff3279669bf35adcc38b321d) has a simple example of running a single layer Conv2D network with sparsity.  \r\n\r\nYou can choose what algorithm the Relay strategy uses with the two environment variables:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport TVM_DIRECT_CONV=1\r\nexport TVM_GEMM_CONV=0\r\n```\r\n\r\nComments on how to improve the integration appreciated.  Further pull requests could add other sparse algorithms, and sparse data formats.\r\n\r\nI am in the process of creating sparse versions for GPU runtimes, but am having some difficulties I am discussing on the

updates `scatter_add` CUDA schedule for more parallelism.\r\n\r\n`scatter_add` GPU introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6856 uses the same schedule as `scatter`. From what I can tell, `scatter` GPU schedule sacrifices performance for guaranteed determinism: The axis which is scattered over is updated exclusively by the same thread, so that there is no chance the same output index is updated by different threads. See for example `scatter` 2D with axis = 0:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/0421efba4c3a42c6cf8d692734c24fe8e08e3884/python/tvm/topi/cuda/scatter.py#L142-L152\r\n\r\nNote that `ni` dimension, which is the axis being scattered over, is processed sequentially by the same thread. This kills performance if `ni` dimension is large. In particular, `scatter` 1D implementation is not parallelized at all, it only uses a single block with a single thread (!!). Here is an example of `scatter` 1D kernel code from one of pytorch frontend tests (part of `bincount`, implemented via `scatter_add`). \r\n\r\n```\r\nextern \"C\" __global__ void fused_scatter_add_kernel1(int* __restrict__ placeholder, int* __restrict__ scatter_add_gpu, int* __restrict__ placeholder1, int any_dim) {\r\n  for (int i = 0; i < 10000; ++i) {\r\n    if (placeholder[(i)] < 0) {\r\n      scatter_add_gpu[((placeholder[(i)] + any_dim))] = (scatter_add_gpu[((placeholder[(i)] + any_dim))] + placeholder1[(i)]);\r\n    } else {\r\n      scatter_add_gpu[(placeholder[(i)])] = (scatter_add_gpu[(placeholder[(i)])] + placeholder1[(i)]);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can understand that we cannot do better if we want to guarantee determinism. But I realized that for `scatter_add`, the situation is a bit more relaxed: we can use atomic add instruction to unlock maximum parallelism, while ensuring (some) determinism. Non determinism can arise for floats, but this limitation is common in other `scatter_add` GPU implementations I looked at (pytorch, cupy, xla etc). \r\n\r\nI've only updated `scatter_add` 1D schedule, since its performance is the most terrible and fixing it is my priority. Also I don't want to roll another `num_dimension` x `num_axis` patterns of IR. Maybe if I find a clean way to implement a single implementation that handles all combination of dimensions and axes, I'll update other schedules too.\r\n\r\nplease review @mbrookhart @tkonolige

we use `hardware_params->max_registers_per_block` got from Cuda device query as the value of `max_local_memory_per_block` in `VerifyGPUCode`. This is wrong. They are just not the same thing.\r\nLuckily, for NVIDIA GPUs, this bug does not affect the performance. Because `kMaxRegistersPerBlock` returns a very large value. The check in `VerifyGPUCode` with this large value almost affects nothing.\r\n\r\nWe have to rename `hardware_params->max_registers_per_block` to a correct name `hardware_params->max_local_memory_per_block`, so it is more meaningful for other backends.\r\n\r\nA better way is to set it as `INT32_MAX` to simply skip this check. Because there is no hard limitation in the CUDA runtime for this value. Setting it to `INT32_MAX` can enlarge the search space while keeping most of the measured schedules still valid.","created_at":"2020-12-05T05:45:14Z","updated_at":"2020-12-05T11:51:08Z","closed_at":"2020-12-05T10:21:19Z","merged_at":"2020-12-05T10:21:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"878a0a999724796725e8516a83684b2b6ae7ba97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7040/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7040/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7040/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/26cd72768712dea44d7436df372b8be65404df2e","head":{"label":"merrymercy:pr-fix-hardware-param","ref":"pr-fix-hardware-param","sha":"26cd72768712dea44d7436df372b8be65404df2e","user":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110390605,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTAzOTA2MDU=","name":"tvm","full_name":"merrymercy/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy/tvm","description":"End

found some shapes and parameters (padding) are converted to int64 from tflite frontend.\r\nThe consequence is that the shape of a placeholder becomes `[1, (int64) 112, (int64) 112, 64]`. Some of them are int64, the others are int32.\r\nThis type-mixed shape fails some optimization in the auto-scheduler.\r\n\r\nThe reason for int64 shape is `ShapeAsNumpy` returns `np.int32`, and it is automatically upcasted to `np.int64` when doing computation. To fix this, I convert all `np.int32` to python's int to prevent auto upcast.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-04T02:59:15Z","updated_at":"2020-12-04T16:19:35Z","closed_at":"2020-12-04T15:56:16Z","merged_at":"2020-12-04T15:56:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"9554e645922357af1d11679a102f3763b80b740f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mbaret","id":55580676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTgwNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55580676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaret","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7030/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7030/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7030/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/24329625998c022a6ef777467c7b4d8b13e503a3","head":{"label":"merrymercy:pr-fix-tflite","ref":"pr-fix-tflite","sha":"24329625998c022a6ef777467c7b4d8b13e503a3","user":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110390605,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTAzOTA2MDU=","name":"tvm","full_name":"merrymercy/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy/tvm","description":"End

Refactor the task and tuning interface for tuning a single operator.\r\n- Use `InsertTransformStage` as the default layout rewrite option for CPU target.
