timestamp type, so Spark should write both timestamp_ltz and timestamp_ntz as Hive' timestamp.\r\nWhen Spark read schema form Hive, We should restore the timestamp_ntz type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe hive 2.3.9 does not have 2 timestamp or a type named timestamp_ntz.\r\nFYI, In hive 3.0, the will be a timestamp with local timezone added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to make `UnionExec` support columnar if all its children support that.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor `UnionExec`, if all its children support columnar, the union physical plan should be able to support columnar too as it is just union of all partitions from the children. By doing this, we can avoid unnecessary transition between row and columnar batch.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nDuring Spark 3.3, we added code-gen for FULL OUTER shuffled hash join, FULL OUTER sort merge join, and Existence sort merge join. Given the join test coverage is not high, and we would love to avoid any upcoming release regression due to it. So here we introduce three internal configs to allow users and developers to disable code-gen in case we found any bug after release.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAllow users for quick mitigation in case any bug found. Avoid release regression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, three internal configs to control each join. By default they are true, so code-gen is enabled.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nOnly added configs here, so rely on existing tests.","created_at":"2021-11-18T07:04:28Z","updated_at":"2021-11-19T05:03:30Z","closed_at":"2021-11-19T04:37:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cb1ec220a6240d59bd44c08e15c9fa51242d6fc2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34643/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34643/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34643/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b12cc90b8ce047d5111ba0d82d5ec8f171fb6aaa","head":{"label":"c21:join-config","ref":"join-config","sha":"b12cc90b8ce047d5111ba0d82d5ec8f171fb6aaa","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

In particular, this change adds a new method in `SparkPlan` called `supportsRowBased`, alongside with the existing `supportsColumnar`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe currently have `supportsColumnar` indicating if a physical node can produce columnar output. The current columnar transition rule seems taking an assumption that one node can only produce columnar output but not row-based one if `supportsColumnar` returns true. But actually one node can possibly produce both format, i.e. columnar and row-based. For such node, if we require row-based output, the columnar transition rule will add additional columnar-to-row after it due to the wrong assumption.\r\n\r\nSo this change introduces `supportsRowBased` which is used to indicates if the node can produce row-based output. The rule can check this method when deciding if a columnar-to-row transition is necessary or not.\r\n\r\nFor example, `InMemoryTableScanExec` can produce columnar output. So if its parent plan isn't columnar, the rule adds a `ColumnarToRow` between them, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```\r\n+- Union\r\n:- ColumnarToRow\r\n: +- InMemoryTableScan i#8, j#9\r\n: +- InMemoryRelation i#8, j#9, StorageLevel(disk, memory, deserialized, 1 replicas)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut `InMemoryTableScanExec` is capable of row-based output too. After this change, for such case, we can simply ask `InMemoryTableScanExec` to produce row output instead of a redundant conversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n================================================================================================\r\nInt In-memory\r\n================================================================================================\r\n\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_265-b01 on Mac OS X 10.16\r\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\nInt In-Memory scan:                         Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ncolumnar deserialization + columnar-to-row            228            245          15          4.4         227.7       1.0X\r\nrow-based deserialization                             179            187          10          5.6         179.4       1.3X\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to explicitly GC between each query of TPC-DS.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDue to the lack of memory in GitHub Actions machines, they easily die in the middle of testing. This is rather a bandaid workaround.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt has been tested in the fork of Spark in the company I work

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is to introduce a new expression in Spark - `ZOrder`. The motivation is Z-order enables to sort tuples in a way, to allow efficiently data skipping for columnar file format (Parquet and ORC).\r\n\r\nFor query with filter on combination of multiple columns, example:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM table\r\nWHERE x = 0 OR y = 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nParquet/ORC cannot skip file/row-groups efficiently when reading, even though the table is sorted (locally or globally) on any columns. However when table is Z-order sorted on multiple columns, Parquet/ORC can skip file/row-groups efficiently when reading. We should add the feature in Spark to allow OSS Spark users benefitted in running these queries.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, user can do Z-order sort when writing the table with followed syntax:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nINSERT INTO t\r\nSELECT ...\r\nFROM ...\r\nSORT BY ZORDER(x, y, ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nINSERT INTO t\r\nSELECT ...\r\nFROM ...\r\nORDER BY ZORDER(x, y, ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen when reading the table with filter on `x` and `y`, the performance can be improved by skipping more files and row-groups. More details below for micro benchmark.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the support for Z-order on integer types (byte, short, int, and long). For other data types such as float and string will be added as followup.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for TimestampNTZ type in the JSON data source. \r\n\r\nMost of the functionality has already been added, this patch verifies that writes + reads work for TimestampNTZ type and adds schema inference depending on the timestamp value format written. The following applies:\r\n- If there is a mixture of `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` and `TIMESTAMP_LTZ` values, use `TIMESTAMP_LTZ`.\r\n- If there are only `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` values, resolve using the the default timestamp type configured with `spark.sql.timestampType`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I introduced a new JSON option `timestampNTZFormat` which is similar to `timestampFormat` but it allows to configure read/write pattern for `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` types. It is basically a copy of timestamp pattern but without timezone.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe PR fixes issues when writing and reading TimestampNTZ to and from JSON.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nPreviously, JSON data source would infer timestamp values as `TimestampType` when reading a JSON file. Now, the data source would infer the timestamp value type based on the format (with or without timezone) and default timestamp type based on `spark.sql.timestampType`.\r\n\r\nA new JSON option `timestampNTZFormat` is added to control the way values are formatted during writes or parsed during reads.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI extended `JsonSuite` with a few unit tests to verify that write-read roundtrip works for `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` and `TIMESTAMP_LTZ` values.\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-18T02:07:58Z","updated_at":"2021-12-06T20:56:13Z","closed_at":"2021-12-06T08:24:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1dfddbb783b0fbaab6bb4d1b0340c07e4d7c7f13","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34638/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34638/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34638/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a626c9d15cef85c3ef523a9bec7fa09c214f3ee1","head":{"label":"sadikovi:timestamp-ntz-support-json","ref":"timestamp-ntz-support-json","sha":"a626c9d15cef85c3ef523a9bec7fa09c214f3ee1","user":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60595889,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDU5NTg4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sadikovi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFollowing up on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-31440, values like\r\n`\"value\" : \"total (min, med, max (stageId: taskId))\\n177.0 B (59.0 B, 59.0 B, 59.0 B (stage 1.0: task 5))\"` are currently shown from Rest API calls which are not easily digested in its current form.New processing logic of the values is introduced along with the creation of the following class in the SQL Rest API to organize the metric values: \r\n```\r\ncase class Value private[spark] (stageId: Option[String] = None, taskId: Option[String] = None,\r\n                                 amount: Option[String] = None, min: Option[String] = None,\r\n                                 med: Option[String] = None, max: Option[String] = None)\r\n```\r\nWhich after processing, would make the output look like \r\n`{\r\n      \"value\" : {\r\n        \"stageId\" : \"1.0\",\r\n        \"taskId\" : \"5\",\r\n        \"amount\" : \"177.0 B\",\r\n        \"min\" : \"59.0 B\",\r\n        \"med\" : \"59.0 B\",\r\n        \"max\" : \"59.0 B\"\r\n      }`\r\n\r\nCurrently not in the PR but could be added if there is interest is the normalization of metrics for aggregation purposes such as the following:\r\n- The conversion of hour, minute and second time units to milliseconds.\r\n- PB,TB, GB, MB, KB units are converted to Bytes.\r\n- Comma is removed from Comma formatted Long values (e.g: 8389632)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo organize and process new metric fields in a more user friendly manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, see output below which are gathered from `Check Sql Rest Api Endpoints` Unit Test in SqlResourceWithActualMetricsSuite.scala with AQE set to true.\r\nBefore Changes:\r\n[BeforeSpark37349UT.txt](https://github.com/apache/spark/files/7566623/BeforeSpark37349UT.txt)\r\nAfter changes:\r\n[AfterSpark37349UT.txt](https://github.com/apache/spark/files/7566624/AfterSpark37349UT.txt)\r\n\r\nBackward Compatibility:\r\nAPI Changes were made in `sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/status/api/v1/sql/api.scala`.\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis adds a new config `spark.yarn.am.tokenConfRegex` which is similar to `mapreduce.job.send-token-conf` introduced via [YARN-5910](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-5910). It is used for YARN AM to pass Hadoop configs, such as `dfs.nameservices`, `dfs.ha.namenodes.`, `dfs.namenode.rpc-address.`, etc, to RM for renewing delegation tokens.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[YARN-5910](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-5910) introduced a new config `mapreduce.job.send-token-conf` which can be used to pass a job's local configuration to RM which uses them when renewing delegation tokens. A typical use case is when a YARN cluster needs to talk to multiple HDFS clusters, where the RM may not have all the configs (e.g., `dfs.nameservices`, `dfs.ha.namenodes.<nameservice>.*`, `dfs.namenode.rpc-address`) to connect to these clusters when renewing delegation tokens. In this case, the clients can use the feature to pass their local HDFS configs to RM.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, a new config `spark.yarn.am.tokenConfRegex` will be introduced to Spark users. By default it is disabled.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt seems difficult to come up with a unit test for this. I manually tested it against a YARN cluster with Hadoop version 3.x and it worked as expected.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell --master yarn \\\r\n            --deploy-mode client \\\r\n

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new config `spark.sql.adaptive.rebalancePartitionsSmallPartitionFactor` to make `SMALL_PARTITION_FACTOR` can be configurable in `OptimizeSkewInRebalancePartitions` rule.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor example `Rebalance` provide a functionality that split the large reduce partition into smalls. However we have seen many SQL produce small files due to the last partition.\r\n\r\nLet's say we have one reduce partition and six map partitions and the blocks are: \r\n[10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]\r\nIf the target size is 50, we will get two files with 50 and 10. And it will get worse if there are thousands of reduce partitions.\r\n\r\nIt should be helpful if we can control the min partition size.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, a new config added\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd test in\r\n- org.apache.spark.sql.execution.adaptive.AdaptiveQueryExecSuite\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR moves the BlockInfoManager from a single mutex per instance to much more fine grained locking at the block level. Concretely this PR makes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- The use of `this.synchronized` for guarding against concurrent creation of a block has been replaced with a striped lock. We have effectively replaced a single coarse-grained lock with a lock per block.\r\n- The use of `this.synchronized` for `wait()` and `notifyAll()` has been replaced with per-block Conditions.\r\n- Extract common logic from `lockForWriting` and `lockForReading` into an acquireLock helper method. This deduplication is important given the size of the changes that this PR needed to make to the shared code.\r\n- Optimization: call `currentTaskAttemptId` only once per method by storing its result into a local variable.\r\n\r\nThe PR is the first in a series of PRs. The next one will add group based locking and removal so we can remove broadcasts and cached RDDs in a constant time operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe main motivation for this change is to increase and stabilize throughput of clusters that run a significant number of concurrent queries. In the current situation these queries are fighting for the BlockInfoManager lock when they create broadcasts. The worse problem arrises after we do a full GC. This triggers clean-up of unused broadcasts. The number of broadcasts in the system can be significant (>> 10K) when we run under load. We need to acquire a lock per broadcast block. We end up with all the BM worker threads, the DAG Scheduler thread, and the query threads fighting for a single lock. This causes the throughput to drop to close to 0 during these clean-up periods.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nFunctionally this is covered by existing tests. The performance has been checked by running 32 concurrent streams and hammering a cluster with queries. That shows the throughput drops are mostly gone now. I am not sure how well we can capture this in a non invasive benchmark.\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-17T13:18:59Z","updated_at":"2021-11-18T21:23:12Z","closed_at":"2021-11-18T21:23:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b702fb903aac70fef25c633b9a998baedee06036","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34632/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34632/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34632/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/08a139c680d2ad649c58333314f89c63dce26bcd","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-37356","ref":"SPARK-37356","sha":"08a139c680d2ad649c58333314f89c63dce26bcd","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to support `DayTimeIntervalType` in pandas UDF and Arrow optimization. \r\n\r\n- Change the mapping of Arrow's  `IntervalType` to `DurationType` for `DayTimeIntervalType` (migration guide updated for Arrow developer APIs).\r\n- Add a type mapping for other code paths: `numpy.timedelta64` <> `pyarrow.duration(\"us\")` <> `DayTimeIntervalType`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor changing the mapping of Arrow's  `Interval` type to `Duration` type for `DayTimeIntervalType`, please refer to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32340#discussion_r750909587.\r\n\r\n`DayTimeIntervalType` is already mapped to the concept of duration instead of calendar instance: it's is matched to `pyarrow.duration(\"us\")`, `datetime.timedelta`, and `java.util.Duration`.\r\n\r\n**Spark SQL example**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT timestamp '2029-01-01 00:00:00' - timestamp '2019-01-01 00:00:00'\").show()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|(TIMESTAMP '2029-01-01 00:00:00' - TIMESTAMP '2019-01-01 00:00:00')|\r\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|                                               INTERVAL '3653 00...|\r\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT timestamp '2029-01-01 00:00:00' - timestamp '2019-01-01 00:00:00'\").printSchema()\r\n```\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- (TIMESTAMP '2029-01-01 00:00:00' - TIMESTAMP '2019-01-01 00:00:00'): interval day to second (nullable = false)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Python example:**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import datetime\r\n>>> datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.datetime.now()\r\ndatetime.timedelta(days=-1, seconds=86399, microseconds=999996)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**pandas / PyArrow example:**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pyarrow as pa\r\n>>> import pandas as pd\r\n>>> pdf = pd.DataFrame({'a': [datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.datetime.now()]})\r\n>>> tbl = pa.Table.from_pandas(pdf)\r\n>>> tbl.schema\r\na: duration[ns]\r\n-- schema metadata --\r\npandas: '{\"index_columns\": [{\"kind\": \"range\", \"name\": null, \"start\": 0, \"' + 368\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, after this change, users can use `DayTimeIntervalType` in `SparkSession.createDataFrame(pandas_df)`, `DataFrame.to_pandas`, and pandas UDFs:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import datetime\r\n>>> import pandas as pd\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf\r\n>>>\r\n>>> @pandas_udf(\"interval day to second\")\r\n... def noop(s: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:\r\n...     assert s.iloc[0] == datetime.timedelta(microseconds=123)\r\n...     return s\r\n...\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame(pd.DataFrame({\"a\": [pd.Timedelta(microseconds=123)]}))\r\n>>> df.toPandas()\r\n                       a\r\n0 0 days 00:00:00.000123\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, and unittests were added.","created_at":"2021-11-17T12:11:54Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:52:04Z","closed_at":"2021-11-18T09:15:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"355bb3323ca3879ba9e8e7851307f649004e44ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34631/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34631/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34631/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eb2a55ee3f86341bb6e4d73caef4f55e79713daf","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-37277-1","ref":"SPARK-37277-1","sha":"eb2a55ee3f86341bb6e4d73caef4f55e79713daf","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add a new benchmark to measure the performance on basic state store operations, and the result file.\r\n\r\nThe proposed change of SPARK-37224 (#34502) is applied in the benchmark. As the benchmark number provides, turning off the config brings lots of performance gain in micro-benchmark perspective, while it is still slower than memory-based state store.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo track and verify further performance improvements.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nResult

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that the Java version installed on the container image used by K8s integration tests are not configurable in case the tests are launched by SBT.\r\n\r\n`bin/docker-image-tool.sh` supports `-b java_image_tag=<java image tag>` option to the Java version installed on the container image configurable.\r\nBut `project/SparkBuild.scala` doesn't provide the way to pass the option so we can't change the Java version if the tests are launched by SBT.\r\n\r\nTo allow to change the version, this PR changes `project/SparkBuild.scala` to recognized the environment variable `JAVA_IMAGE_TAG`, which is the same manner that `resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests/scripts/setup-integration-test-env.sh` does.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe K8s integration tests should be launched by any supported Java versions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the support of `DayTimeIntervalType` to Py4J. Namely, it will automatically convert `datetime.timedelta` to `java.util.Duration` that is mapped to `DayTimeIntervalType` in Scala/Java.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo complete ANSI interval type supports in PySpark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, after this changes, users can use `datetime.timedelta` as an arguments in PySpark APIs.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd timeoutExecutor shutdown method in SparkExecuteStatementOperation and shut down when statement finished or error.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen spark.sql.thriftServer.queryTimeout or java.sql.Statement.setQueryTimeout is setted >0 , SparkExecuteStatementOperation add timeoutExecutor to kill time-consumed query in SPARK-26533. But timeoutExecutor is not shutdown correctly when statement is finished, it can only be shutdown when timeout. When we set timeout to a long time for example 1 hour, the long-running STS driver will FullGC and the application is not available for a long time.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd explicit stageId to operator mapping in the Spark UI that is a more general version of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30209, where a stageId-> operator mapping is done with the following algorithm.\r\n 1. Read SparkGraph to get every Node's name and respective AccumulatorIDs.\r\n 2. Gets each stage's AccumulatorIDs.\r\n 3. Maps Operators to stages by checking for non-zero intersection of Step 1 and 2's AccumulatorIDs.\r\n 4. Connect SparkGraphNodes to respective StageIDs for rendering in SQL UI.\r\nAs a result, some operators without max metrics values will also have stageIds in the UI. In some cases, there is no operator->StageID mapping made because no stageIds have accumulatorIds that are a part of the Operator's accumulatorIds. URL links at the top to go to the succeeded jobs and completed stages that were executed as a part of the selected query are also provided.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMakes for easier and quicker debugging and navigation.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, `Succeeded Jobs:` and `Completed Stages:`listed at the top of the UI, along with `Stages:` in some of the operators.\r\n<img width=\"697\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-11-16 at 11 35 51 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16739760/142054791-8229d142-41cd-4706-a53e-7abb51e5901c.png\">\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual test locally in SQL UI.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite`, `YarnShuffleAuthSuite` and `YarnShuffleAlternateNameConfigSuite` will failed when using `hadoop-3.2` profile without `assembly/target/scala-%s/jars`,  the fail reason is `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: breeze/linalg/Matrix`.\r\n\r\nThe above UTS can succeed when using `hadoop-2.7` profile without `assembly/target/scala-%s/jars` because `KryoSerializer.loadableSparkClasses` can workaroud when `Utils.isTesting` is true, but `Utils.isTesting` is false when using `hadoop-3.2` profile.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter investigated, I found that when `hadoop-2.7` profile is used, `SPARK_TESTING`  will be propagated to AM and Executor, but when `hadoop-3.2` profile is used, `SPARK_TESTING`  will not be propagated to AM and Executor.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure the consistent behavior of using `hadoop-2.7` and ``hadoop-3.2``, this pr change to manually propagate `SPARK_TESTING` environment variable if it exists to ensure `Utils.isTesting` is true in above test scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEnsure `YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite` releated UTs can succeed when using `hadoop-3.2` profile without `assembly/target/scala-%s/jars`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n\r\n- Manual test `YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite`. `YarnShuffleAuthSuite` and `YarnShuffleAlternateNameConfigSuite`  can be verified in the same way.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that the `assembly/target/scala-%s/jars` directory does not exist before executing the test command, we can clean up the whole project by executing follow command or clone a new local code repo.\r\n\r\n1. run with `hadoop-3.2` profile\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn clean install -Phadoop-3.2 -Pyarn -Dtest=none

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd timeoutExecutor shutdown method in SparkExecuteStatementOperation and shut down when statement finished or error.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements `DayTimeIntervalType` in PySpark's `DataFrame.collect()`, `SparkSession.createDataFrame()` and `functions.udf`.\r\nThis type is mapped to [`datetime.timedelta`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects).\r\n\r\nArrow code path will be separately implemented at SPARK-37277, and Py4J support will be done at SPARK-37281.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- In order to support `datetime.timedelta` out of the box via PySpark.\r\n- To seamlessly support ANSI standard types\r\n\r\nSemantically [`datetime.timedelta`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects) is mapped to `DayTimeIntervalType`. Python's timedelta does not support months, years, etc.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users will be able to use `datetime.timedelta` in PySpark with `DayTimeIntervalType` at `DataFrame.collect()`, `SparkSession.createDataFrame()` and `functions.udf`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import datetime\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([(datetime.timedelta(days=1),)])\r\n>>> df.collect()\r\n[Row(_1=datetime.timedelta(days=1))]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import udf\r\n>>> df.select(udf(lambda x: x, \"interval day to second\")(\"_1\")).show()\r\n+--------------------+\r\n|        <lambda>(_1)|\r\n+--------------------+\r\n|INTERVAL '1 00:00...|\r\n+--------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were added, and

Currently `readBooleans` unpacks encoded boolean values bit by bit such as\r\n```\r\n  public final void readBooleans(int total, WritableColumnVector c, int rowId) {\r\n    // TODO: properly vectorize this\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < total; i++) {\r\n      c.putBoolean(rowId + i, readBoolean());\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThe main idea is to unpack 8 bits (a byte) at once instead of bit by bit whenever the alignment allows.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWith this PR, we observed up-to 100% scan performance gain.\r\n#### JDK11 (Main Branch)\r\n```\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8272CL CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\nSQL Single BOOLEAN Column Scan:           Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSQL Parquet Vectorized                              161            189          24         97.6          10.2\r\n\r\nParquet Reader Single BOOLEAN Column Scan:  Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nParquetReader Vectorized                             140            147           9        112.7           8.9\r\nParquetReader Vectorized -> Row                       85             88           3        184.4           5.4\r\n```\r\n#### JDK11 (This PR)\r\n```\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8272CL CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\nSQL Single BOOLEAN Column Scan:           Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSQL Parquet Vectorized                              124            149          21        127.2           7.9\r\n\r\nParquet Reader Single BOOLEAN Column Scan:  Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nParquetReader Vectorized                             100            107          13        157.1           6.4\r\nParquetReader Vectorized -> Row                       52             54           3        303.1           3.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### JDK8 (Main Branch)\r\n```\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8272CL CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\nSQL Single BOOLEAN Column Scan:           Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSQL Parquet Vectorized                              189            210          20         83.1          12.0\r\n\r\nParquet Reader Single BOOLEAN Column Scan:  Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nParquetReader Vectorized                             178            179           3         88.5          11.3\r\nParquetReader Vectorized -> Row                      125            126           2        126.1           7.9\r\n```\r\n#### JDK8 (This PR)\r\n```\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2673 v3 @ 2.40GHz\r\nSQL Single BOOLEAN Column Scan:           Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSQL Parquet Vectorized                              144            167          12        109.2           9.2\r\n\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2673 v3 @ 2.40GHz\r\nParquet Reader Single BOOLEAN Column Scan:  Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nParquetReader Vectorized                             119            125           8        131.9           7.6\r\nParquetReader Vectorized -> Row                       60             63           2        260.2           3.8\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe benchmarks are run on GitHub Actions.

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Move `ALTER NAMESPACE ... SET LOCATION` parsing tests to `AlterNamespaceSetLocationParserSuite`.\r\n2. Put common `ALTER NAMESPACE ... SET LOCATION` tests into one trait `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.command.AlterNamespaceSetLocationSuiteBase`, and put datasource specific tests to the `v1.AlterNamespaceSetLocationSuite` and `v2.AlterNamespaceSetLocationSuite`.\r\n\r\nThe changes follow the approach of #30287.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. The unification will allow to run common `ALTER NAMESPACE ... SET LOCATION` tests for both DSv1/Hive DSv1 and DSv2\r\n2. We can detect missing features and differences between DSv1 and DSv2 implementations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests and new tests.","created_at":"2021-11-15T20:39:23Z","updated_at":"2021-12-09T18:38:46Z","closed_at":"2021-11-25T07:47:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5ab4dd860decccdc8a95bcd4bef71821556dc15a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34610/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34610/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34610/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/caacba6722da58307a7562a0366afa979234b329","head":{"label":"imback82:alter_namespace_set_loation_tests2","ref":"alter_namespace_set_loation_tests2","sha":"caacba6722da58307a7562a0366afa979234b329","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe PR is proposed to:\r\n\r\n- Undeprecate (Spark)DataFrame.to_koalas \r\n\r\n- Deprecate (Spark)DataFrame.to_pandas_like and introduce (Spark)DataFrame.pandas_api instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, (Spark)DataFrame.to_pandas_on_spark is too long to memorize and inconvenient to call.\r\nWith the proposal of the PR, we may improve the user experience and make APIs more developer-friendly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n(Spark)DataFrame.pandas_api is introduced.\r\n(Spark)DataFrame.to_pandas_on_spark is deprecated.\r\n(Spark)DataFrame.to_koalas is undeprecated.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```py\r\n>>> sdf = spark.createDataFrame([{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 1}])\r\n\r\n>>> sdf.pandas_api()\r\n   age   name\r\n0    1  Alice\r\n\r\n>>> sdf.to_pandas_on_spark()\r\n/Users/xinrong.meng/spark/python/pyspark/sql/dataframe.py:3207: FutureWarning:

### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently there are no speculation metrics available for Spark either at application/job/stage level. This PR is to add some basic speculation metrics for a stage when speculation execution is enabled.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the existing stage level metrics tracking numTotal (total number of speculated tasks), numCompleted (total number of successful speculated tasks), numFailed (total number of failed speculated tasks), numKilled (total number of killed speculated tasks) etc.\r\n\r\nWith this new set of metrics, it helps further understanding speculative execution feature in the context of the application and also helps in further tuning the speculative execution config knobs.\r\n\r\n ### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdditional metrics for speculative execution.\r\n\r\n ### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, Stages Page in SHS UI will have an additional table for speculation metrics, if present.\r\n\r\n ### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests added and also tested on our internal platform.\r\n\r\nAbsence of speculation metrics : \r\n![Screen

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nExplicitly cancel the delegation token that's not taken care of by YARN.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nLeaking file system delegation tokens create burden for the file system components (for example, KMS), and in the worst case, cause performance regression or even making FS inaccessible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nManually tested on a small cluster, verify the kms delegation tokens are created and cancelled

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix the issue that OptimizeSkewedJoin may not work.\r\nSince OptimizeSkewedJoin was moved from `queryStageOptimizerRules` to `queryStagePreparationRules,` the position OptimizeSkewedJoin was applied has been moved from `newQueryStage()` to `reOptimize()`. The plan OptimizeSkewedJoin applied on changed from plan of new stage which is about to submit to whole spark plan.\r\nIn the cases where skewedJoin is not last stage, OptimizeSkewedJoin may not work because the number of collected shuffleStages is more than 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n###

ADD COLUMNS` command for tables in v1 and v2 In-Memory catalogs. Also added an unified test suite to migrate related tests in the future.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL. After the changes, users will be able to add columns with ANSI intervals instead of dropping and creating new table.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIn some sense, yes. After the changes, the command doesn't output any error message.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *AlterTableAddColumnsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch adds a new method `getAdditionalPreKubernetesResources` for `KubernetesFeatureConfigStep`. It returns any additional Kubernetes resources that should be added to support this feature and resources would be setup before driver pod \r\ncreating.\r\n\r\nAfter this patch:\r\n- `getAdditionalPreKubernetesResources`: Devs should return resources in here when they want to create resources before pod creating\r\n- `getAdditionalKubernetesResources`: Devs should return resources in here when they can accept the resources create after pod, and spark will also help to refresh owner reference after resources created, that means if any resource is expected to refresh the owner pod reference, it should be added it here, even if it already in the getAdditionalPreKubernetesResources as same.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe need to setup K8S resources or extension resources before driver pod creating, and then create pod, after the pod created, the owner refernce would be owner to this Pod.\r\n\r\nThese pre-resources are usually necessary in pod creation and scheduling, they should be ready before pod creation, should be deleted when user delete pod, the lifecycle of these resource is same with pod, such as the customized batch scheduler scenario, the user need to create the addtional pre resources (such as pod group in Volcano) to help the specific spark job complete batch scheduling.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT","created_at":"2021-11-15T09:26:34Z","updated_at":"2021-12-18T07:38:13Z","closed_at":"2021-12-18T01:14:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d7890c525807a7d931ea5d451adc8caf77d1180","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34599/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34599/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34599/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2613a924312bc89161e06ee40c4efc0dd99f9d7e","head":{"label":"Yikun:SPARK-37331","ref":"SPARK-37331","sha":"2613a924312bc89161e06ee40c4efc0dd99f9d7e","user":{"login":"Yikun","id":1736354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzYzNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1736354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun","html_url":"https://github.com/Yikun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335541670,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU1NDE2NzA=","name":"spark","full_name":"Yikun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Yikun","id":1736354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzYzNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1736354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun","html_url":"https://github.com/Yikun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Yikun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for TimestampNTZ type in the CSV data source. \r\n\r\nMost of the functionality has already been added, this patch verifies that writes + reads work for TimestampNTZ type and adds schema inference depending on the timestamp value format written. The following applies:\r\n- If there is a mixture of `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` and `TIMESTAMP_LTZ` values, use `TIMESTAMP_LTZ`.\r\n- If there are only `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` values, resolve using the the default timestamp type configured with `spark.sql.timestampType`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I introduced a new CSV option `timestampNTZFormat` which is similar to `timestampFormat` but it allows to configure read/write pattern for `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` types. It is basically a copy of timestamp pattern but without timezone.\r\n\r\nThe schema inference works in the following way:\r\n1. We test if the field can be parsed a timestamp without timezone using timestampNTZFormat.\r\n2. If the field has the timezone component, `parseWithoutTimeZone` method throws `QueryExecutionErrors.cannotParseStringAsDataTypeError` which is a `RuntimeException`.\r\n3. Move on to parsing the field as timestamp with timezone (the existing logic).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current CSV source could write values as TimestampNTZ into a file but could not preserve this type when reading the file back, this PR fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nPreviously, CSV data source would infer timestamp values as `TimestampType` when reading a CSV file. Now, the data source would infer the timestamp value type based on the format (with or without timezone) and default timestamp type based on `spark.sql.timestampType`.\r\n\r\nA new CSV option `timestampNTZFormat` is added to control the way values are formatted during writes or parsed during reads.\r\n\r\nNow if the timestamp cannot be parsed as a timestamp without timezone, e.g. contains the zone-offset or zone-id component, `parseWithTimeZone` throws `RuntimeException` signalling the inference code to try the next type.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI extended `CSVSuite` with a few unit tests to verify that write-read roundtrip works for `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` and `TIMESTAMP_LTZ` values.

Adds support for Decimal RoundingMode.UP, DOWN and HALF_DOWN by letting users to pass the rounding mode as argument to round function.\r\n2. bround function calls round function with the argument \"half_even\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently there's no easier and straight forward way to round decimals with the mode UP, DOWN and HALF_DOWN. People need to use UDF or complex operations to do the same.\r\n\r\nOpening support for the other rounding modes might interest a lot of use cases.\r\n\r\n**SAP Hana Sql ROUND function does it :** \r\n\r\n`ROUND(<number> [, <position> [, <rounding_mode>]])`\r\n\r\nREF : https://help.sap.com/viewer/7c78579ce9b14a669c1f3295b0d8ca16/Cloud/en-US/20e6a27575191014bd54a07fd86c585d.html\r\n\r\n\r\n**Sql Server does something similar to this :**\r\n\r\n`ROUND ( numeric_expression , length [ ,function ] )`\r\n\r\nREF : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/round-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNow, users can specify the rounding mode while calling round function for round modes up, down, half_down. Calling round function without rounding mode will default to half_up.\r\n\r\n```\r\n> SELECT round(3.145, 2)\r\n3.15\r\n\r\n>SELECT round(3.145, 2, 'down')\r\n3.14\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ndf.withColumn(\"value_rounded\", round('value, 0)\r\n\r\ndf.withColumn(\"value_rounded\", round('value, 0, \"down\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThis patch was tested locally using unit test and git workflow.","created_at":"2021-11-14T23:07:33Z","updated_at":"2022-03-08T00:14:34Z","closed_at":"2022-03-08T00:14:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bca2ac0ebb71f68560337b4a868313965bbaa1d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34593/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34593/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34593/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e7f62614f316756f9989099ec73fc54f5d73a05d","head":{"label":"sathiyapk:SPARK-37324-round-mode-up-down","ref":"SPARK-37324-round-mode-up-down","sha":"e7f62614f316756f9989099ec73fc54f5d73a05d","user":{"login":"sathiyapk","id":5880194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODAxOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk","html_url":"https://github.com/sathiyapk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100880777,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA4ODA3Nzc=","name":"spark","full_name":"sathiyapk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sathiyapk","id":5880194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODAxOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk","html_url":"https://github.com/sathiyapk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sathiyapk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nI manually modified the test code, inserting sleep like the diff shown above, and confirmed no

thrown.","created_at":"2021-11-13T15:57:25Z","updated_at":"2021-11-14T01:29:19Z","closed_at":"2021-11-13T18:45:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c431a7b676b8a9449df7d9a329742c8c12a05ec0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34583/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34583/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34583/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f2443e125971c6c03e4988666ea8de2dc7b954ba","head":{"label":"sarutak:fix-concurrent-modifiation-exception-mlevent","ref":"fix-concurrent-modifiation-exception-mlevent","sha":"f2443e125971c6c03e4988666ea8de2dc7b954ba","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

Followed the same algorithm in iterator mode - `SortMergeFullOuterJoinScanner`: maintain buffer for join left and right sides, and iterate over matched rows in buffers.\r\n\r\nExample query:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval df1 = spark.range(5).select($\"id\".as(\"k1\"))\r\nval df2 = spark.range(10).select($\"id\".as(\"k2\"))\r\ndf1.join(df2.hint(hint), $\"k1\" === $\"k2\" % 3 && $\"k1\" + 3 =!= $\"k2\", \"full_outer\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample generated code: https://gist.github.com/c21/5cab9751f24ae448d77a259d28cb77d7\r\n\r\nIn addition, to help review as this PR triggers several TPCDS plan files change. The below files are having the real code change:\r\n\r\n* `SortMergeJoinExec.scala`\r\n* `WholeStageCodegenSuite.scala`\r\n\r\nAll other files are auto-generated golden file plan changes for TPCDS queries.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`TaskSchedulerImpl` handle task finished event at `handleSuccessfulTask` and `handleFailedTask` , but in some case the task was already finished state, which we should ignore task finished event.\r\n\r\nCase describe: \r\nwhen a executor finished a task of some stage, the driver will receive a StatusUpdate event to handle it. At the same time the driver found the executor heartbeat timed out, so the dirver also need handle ExecutorLost event simultaneously. There was a race condition issues here, which will make TaskSetManager.successful and TaskSetManager.tasksSuccessful wrong result. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n It will cause `TaskSetManager.successful` and `TaskSetManager.tasksSuccessful` wrong result. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes a new interface in Spark SQL that allows users to query the metadata of the input files for all file formats. Spark SQL will expose them as **built-in hidden columns** meaning **users can only see them when they explicitly reference them**. Currently, This PR proposes to support the following metadata columns inside of a metadata struct `_metadata`:\r\n\r\n| Name  | Type | Description | Example |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| _metadata.file_path  | String  | The absolute file path of the input file. | file:/tmp/spark-7f600b30-b3ec-43a8-8cd2-686491654f9b/f0.csv |\r\n| _metadata.file_name  | String  | The name of the input file along with the extension. | f0.csv |\r\n| _metadata.file_size  | Long  | The length of the input file, in bytes. | 628 |\r\n| _metadata.file_modification_time  | Timestamp  | The modification timestamp of the file. | 2021-12-20 20:05:21 |\r\n\r\nThis proposed hidden file metadata interface has the following behaviors:\r\n- **Hidden**: metadata columns are hidden. They will not show up when only selecting data columns or selecting all `(SELECT *)`. In other words, they are not returned unless being explicitly referenced.\r\n- **Not overwrite the data schema**: in the case of name collisions with data columns, data columns will be returned instead of the metadata columns. In other words, metadata columns can not overwrite user data in any case.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve the Spark SQL observability for **all file formats** that still leverage DSV1.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. \r\n```\r\nspark.read.format(\"csv\")\r\n     .schema(schema)\r\n     .load(\"file:/tmp/*\")\r\n     .select(\"name\", \"age\",\r\n             \"_metadata.file_path\", \"_metadata.file_name\",\r\n             \"_metadata.file_size\", \"_metadata.file_modification_time\")\r\n```\r\nExample return:\r\n| name  | age | file_path | file_name | file_size | file_modification_time |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| Debbie | 18 | file:/tmp/f0.csv | f0.csv | 12 | 2021-07-02 01:05:21 |\r\n| Frank | 24 | file:/tmp/f1.csv | f1.csv | 11 | 2021-12-20 02:06:21 |\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new testsuite: FileMetadataColumnsSuite\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-12T21:41:48Z","updated_at":"2021-12-22T23:23:36Z","closed_at":"2021-12-21T14:47:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"30471682018de970205219c9199e3b57d894337e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34575/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34575/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34575/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4400f6ac93359eb15f498f19581247dc9744d989","head":{"label":"Yaohua628:spark-37273","ref":"spark-37273","sha":"4400f6ac93359eb15f498f19581247dc9744d989","user":{"login":"Yaohua628","id":79476540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2NTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628","html_url":"https://github.com/Yaohua628","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":425586598,"node_id":"R_kgDOGV3vpg","name":"spark","full_name":"Yaohua628/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Yaohua628","id":79476540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2NTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628","html_url":"https://github.com/Yaohua628","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Yaohua628/spark","description":"Apache

REPLACE COLUMNS` command for tables in v2 catalogs (v1 catalogs don't support the command). Also added unified test suite to migrate related tests in the future.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL. After the changes, users can replace columns with ANSI intervals instead of removing and adding such columns.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIn some sense, yes. After the changes, the command doesn't output any error message.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AlterTableReplaceColumnsSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-11-12T11:16:06Z","updated_at":"2021-11-15T15:14:18Z","closed_at":"2021-11-12T14:23:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"13e1126a636eb5e59dfc764a5b260e00e757ce83","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34571/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34571/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34571/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cf76e091482ad82ec8d41794bd677bf223cb18e0","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:add-replace-ansi-interval-col","ref":"add-replace-ansi-interval-col","sha":"cf76e091482ad82ec8d41794bd677bf223cb18e0","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

{\r\n    acc.add(i.toString)\r\n    if (i % 10000 == 0) {\r\n      acc.reset()\r\n      if ((System.currentTimeMillis() - start) / 1000 > 120) {\r\n        stop = true\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    i = i

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Add a new trait `V1Write` to hold some sort infos of v1 write. e.g., partition columns, bucket spec.\r\n- Then let the following writing command extend the `V1Write`, includes both datasource and hive\r\n  - InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand\r\n  - CreateDataSourceTableAsSelectCommand\r\n  - InsertIntoHiveTable\r\n  - CreateHiveTableAsSelectBase\r\n- Add a new rule `V1Writes` to decide if we should add a `Sort` operator based its `V1Write.requiredOrdering`.  This rule should be similar with `V2Writes`.\r\n- So now we can remove the `SortExec` in `FileFormatWriter.write`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`FileFormatWriter.write` now is used by all V1 write which includes datasource and hive table. However it contains a sort which is based on dynamic partition and bucket columns that can not be seen in plan directly.\r\n\r\nV2 write has a better approach that it satisfies the order or even distribution by using rule `V2Writes`.\r\n\r\nV1 write should do the similar thing with V2 write.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nthis is a code refactor, so it should pass

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR removes about the reference of ``typeName()`` in PySpark documentation. Using `DataType.typeName` is PySpark specific legacy behaviour. We should better stick to one format in documentation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUsing `typeName` is not actually correct for DDL parsing. Differences between `DataType.typeName` and `DataType.simpleString` are:\r\n\r\n- `byte` <> `tinyint`\r\n- `short` <> `smallint`\r\n- `decimal` <> `decimal(10,0)`\r\n- `integer` <> `int`\r\n\r\nWhile other cases are fine, `decimal` will lost precision and scale if we encourage to use `DataType.typeName`\r\n\r\nThe only reason  why `DataType.typeName` was mentioned is about JSON parsing (at https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/d57daf1f7732a7ac54a91fe112deeda0a254f9ef) because internally we use `DataType.typeName` but that format is internal.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIt changes documentation in PySpark API documentation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI in this PR should test it out.\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-12T04:18:27Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:52:12Z","closed_at":"2021-11-12T06:07:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5fbc6c8d9dd9dc80b0803573e1ec41b8944289d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34565/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34565/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34565/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cd28f60009c1f22089f451db55df794c689f7317","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:minor-doc-fix-schema","ref":"minor-doc-fix-schema","sha":"cd28f60009c1f22089f451db55df794c689f7317","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen use write pyspark script like\r\n```\r\nconf = SparkConf().setAppName(\"test\")\r\nsc = SparkContext(conf = conf)\r\nsession = SparkSession().build().enableHiveSupport().getOrCreate()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will build a session without hive support since we use a existed SparkContext and we create SparkSession use \r\n```\r\nSparkSession(sc)\r\n```\r\nThis cause we loss configuration added by `config()` such as catalog implement.\r\n\r\nIn scala class `SparkSession`, we create `SparkSession` with `SparkContext` and option configurations and will pass option configurations to `SharedState` then use `SharedState`'s conf create SessionState, but in pyspark, we won't pass options configuration to `SharedState`, but pass to `SessionState`, but this time `SessionState` has been initialized.  So it won't support hive.\r\n\r\nIn this pr, I pass option configurations to `SharedState` when first init `SparkSession`, then when  init `SessionState`, this options will be passed to `SessionState` too.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid loss configuration when build SparkSession in pyspark\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManuel tested & added

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds codegen support to array based higher order functions except ArraySort. This is my first time playing around with codegen, so definitely looking for any feedback.\r\n\r\nA few notes:\r\n- Disabled subexpression elimination for lambda functions (this already was the case because it was CodegenFallback). I plan to explore supprting subexpression elimination inside lambda functions later on, as it will require special handling.\r\n- I set the AtomicReference for all lambda values as well in case a child expression reverts to interpreted evaluation for any reason (CodegenFallback or otherwise)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo improve performance of array higher-order function operations, letting the children be codegen'd and participate in WholeStageCodegen\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, only performance improvements.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests, let me know if there's other codegen-specific unit tests I should add.","created_at":"2021-11-11T13:55:00Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T13:55:54Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1c4aa15fc8f89399e3034ca90d69045bd54e246b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34558/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34558/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34558/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/419b1fdba524978b692c1677fa3368f0553cc6e7","head":{"label":"Kimahriman:array-hof-codegen","ref":"array-hof-codegen","sha":"419b1fdba524978b692c1677fa3368f0553cc6e7","user":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":358979577,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg5Nzk1Nzc=","name":"spark","full_name":"Kimahriman/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes since annotation to support `float` arguments:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef since(version: Union[str, float]) -> Callable[[T], T]: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`since` is used with both `str` and `float` both in Spark and related libraries and this change has been already done for Spark >= 3.3 (SPARK-36906),\r\n\r\nNote that this technically fixes a bug in the downstream projects that run mypy checks against `pyspark.since`. When they use it, for example, with `pyspark.since(3.2)`, mypy checks fails; however, this case is legitimate. After this change, the mypy check can pass in thier CIs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@since(3.2)\r\ndef f():\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nis going to type check if downstream projects run mypy to validate the types.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it does not affect anything invasive or user-facing behavior change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests and manual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, the method `compileAggregates` is a member of `JDBCRDD`. But it is not reasonable, because the JDBC source knowns how to compile aggregate expressions to itself's dialect well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nJDBC source knowns how to compile aggregate expressions to itself's dialect well.\r\nAfter this PR, we can extend the pushdown(e.g. aggregate) based on different dialect between different JDBC database.\r\n\r\nThere are two situations:\r\nFirst, database A and B implement a different number of aggregate functions that meet the SQL standard.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'. Just change the inner implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-11T09:45:05Z","updated_at":"2021-12-04T01:35:30Z","closed_at":"2021-12-03T13:12:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0b8c12cb6085e4e2c7329907a7a290b6f636c95f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34554/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34554/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34554/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/78eb36cbeb727c4b9d1ee5fbc11ae3120b49f6fd","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-37286","ref":"SPARK-37286","sha":"78eb36cbeb727c4b9d1ee5fbc11ae3120b49f6fd","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

surprising and confusable.\r\nSo the solution this PR proposes is not to try to create such tables in Hive compatible format because it should always fail, and logs a message which says the table is stored in Spark specific format.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes add warning class `PandasAPIOnSparkAdviceWarning`, so that users can manually turn the warning off by using `warnings.simplefilter`.\r\n\r\nThe `PandasAPIOnSparkAdviceWarning` is issued by default as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> psdf.to_pandas()\r\n/Users/haejoon.lee/Desktop/git_store/spark/python/pyspark/pandas/utils.py:971: PandasAPIOnSparkAdviceWarning: `to_pandas` loads all data into the driver's memory. It should only be used if the resulting pandas DataFrame is expected to be small.\r\n  warnings.warn(message, PandasAPIOnSparkAdviceWarning)\r\n   A\r\n0  1\r\n1  2\r\n2  3\r\n3  4\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor silencing the advice warning message, you can use `warnings.simplefilter` with specifying the `PandasAPIOnSparkAdviceWarning` class  as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.pandas.utils import PandasAPIOnSparkAdviceWarning\r\n>>> with warnings.catch_warnings():\r\n...     warnings.simplefilter('ignore', PandasAPIOnSparkAdviceWarning)\r\n...     psdf.to_pandas()\r\n...\r\n   A\r\n0  1\r\n1  2\r\n2  3\r\n3  4\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSometimes the messages are too verbose to display, so someone might not need to see the advice log.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe `UserWarning` for log_advice is changed to `PandasAPIOnSparkAdviceWarning`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `ExtendedLevelDBTest ` to disable `LevelDB` selectively on Apple Silicon.\r\n- Add `ExtendedLevelDBTest ` test tag\r\n- Disable LevelDB test cases from `kvstore` module/`HistoryServerSuite`/`AppStatusStoreSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nJava 17 officially support Apple Silicon.\r\n- JEP 391: macOS/AArch64 Port\r\n- https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8251280\r\n\r\nIn addition, Oracle Java, Azul Zulu, and Eclipse Temurin Java 17 supports Apple Silicon natively.\r\n```\r\n/Users/dongjoon/.jenv/versions/oracle17/bin/java: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64\r\n/Users/dongjoon/.jenv/versions/zulu17/bin/java: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64\r\n/Users/dongjoon/.jenv/versions/temurin17/bin/java: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, LevelDBJNI still doesn't support Apple Silicon natively, the relevant test cases fail on M1.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a test-only PR.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRun the above tests on M1.","created_at":"2021-11-11T05:19:28Z","updated_at":"2021-11-18T08:06:29Z","closed_at":"2021-11-11T07:03:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84fb3bb31d799249635668ff097e6d7dcb101f9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED
