addressed.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have

Description ##\r\nCheck padding size for global pooling. #9714 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Check padding size for pooling, cudnn pooling and pooling_v1\r\n- add python test case for global pooling with user padding size and stride size\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\n\r\nMade Storage::Handle objects and the memory they are handling be reference counted.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n  - Unit tests are added\r\n  - Added a functional test\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n  - Existing docs improved\r\n  - New methods documented\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are not affected by this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Ensured that access to memory pointed by storage::Handles is protected by reference counting\r\n- Introduced a common interface to public Storage class and the underlying internal StorageManagers\r\n- Changed referencing of shared memory to a string key\r\n- Separated platform specific CPUSharedStorageManager implementations\r\n- Introduced a functional C++ test\r\n\r\n- Moved NDArray::Chunk implementation to .cc file for compile time and dependendencies reduction\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- The change has grown significantly due to a lot of usages in the code.\r\n\r\n## Still to be done in next iterations ##\r\n- Add Android implementation of CPUSharedStorageManager\r\n- Introduce locking for shared memory\r\n- Add coverage and more edge cases to Storage unit testing\r\n- Add functional test to

Description ##\r\nSpecify and fix pylint as well as cpplint versions in order to provide a consistent behaviour. Otherwise, new slaves (having no docker cache present) might use a newer version of linting and produce different results. Linting reports for the latest version have been fixed in #9660.\r\n\r\nDue to Nvidias update regarding the spectre vulnerability, we were not able to use the nvidia-384 package inside our Dockerfiles. Instead, we're now switching to the cuda-8-0 package, which matches our general CI setup to support CUDA 8.0.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Set CppLint to 1.3.0\r\n- Set PyLint to 1.8.2\r\n- Get CUDA stubs in build_cuda from cuda-8-0 instead of nvidia-384.\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nThis PR improves the performance of `sparse.retain` operator on CPU. The previous implementation uses a single thread to copy the retained data, which usually doesn't saturate the memory bandwidth. Now using kernel launch to utilize multiple threads.\r\n@reminisce \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\nBenchmark script: \r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport time\r\n\r\nmx.random.seed(1)\r\nnp.random.seed(1)\r\nnum_rows = 1024*770\r\nidx = np.random.randint(low=0,

on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

of the benchmark is sent to stderr\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\nBenchmark loops through two batch-sizes (100,000 and 1,000,000) and two output dimensions (100 and 500) and generates random data on CPU and GPU and calls metric.update() on a list of metrics with the generated date.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Added unit-test for benchmarking metric performance. \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Unit-test passes without GPU, but fails if GPU memory allocation fails\r\n- The output looks like this on a p2.x instance\r\n```\r\nmx.metric benchmarks\r\nMetric         Ctx       Batch Size     Output Dim     Elapsed

checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nNAG inherits SGD, but not override SGD's `update_multi_precision` which calls `_update_impl` in SGD.\r\n\r\nNAG should not inherit SGD also because parameter `lazy_update` makes no sense in NAG.\r\n\r\nThanks for @huangzehao reporting this issue.\r\n\r\ncc @eric-haibin-lin @sxjscience \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] unittest\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-05T16:18:54Z","updated_at":"2018-02-12T05:41:55Z","closed_at":"2018-02-05T19:03:09Z","merged_at":"2018-02-05T19:03:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"5e053b81228258d3e9456bc58f822d2a2366d397","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9697/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9697/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9697/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/e31e59e305e3de96d5496c0f707a3444e0aeb8cd","head":{"label":"ZiyueHuang:fix_nag","ref":"fix_nag","sha":"e31e59e305e3de96d5496c0f707a3444e0aeb8cd","user":{"login":"ZiyueHuang","id":24650346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjUwMzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24650346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang","html_url":"https://github.com/ZiyueHuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"4c55d06a457daf484ae7d710a7d05cc1d73e8962","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nPlease see: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Improved+exception+handling+in+MXNet\r\nImplements Exception Handling for Operators.\r\n\r\nFixes #7335 and related issues\r\n\r\n## Functional Testing ##\r\n\r\n* Tested multiple execution graphs with different dependencies to make sure able we are able to handle them seperately.\r\n* Tested multiple wait_to_reads and multiple waitall calls (Added to unittests)\r\n* Tested Gluon, Imperative and Symbolic modes (Added to unittests)\r\n* Tested CPU and GPU memory alloc failures.\r\n* Tested all the use cases pointed out by the community: fixes #8835, fixes #9131, fixes #9567, fixes #9380 \r\n\r\n## Performance Testing ##\r\n\r\nI did a small performance testing task with resnet50 model on cifar10 dataset to make sure that there is no performance degradation because of the additional overhead of OnStart callback in each ExecuteOprBlock. I don't see any change.\r\n\r\n**Model**: resnet50\r\n**Dataset**: cifar10\r\nTested on ec2: p2.8xlarge\r\n\r\n| Mode | Measurement | Before Exception Handling Change | After Exception Handling Change |\r\n| --- | --- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |\r\n| Symbolic | Speed | 1064 samples/sec | 1073 samples/sec |\r\n| Imperative | Speed | 187 samples/sec | 184 samples/sec |\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Exception handling for Operators, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n@cjolivier01 @mli @piiswrong @madjam @asmushetzel @eric-haibin-lin @reminisce @rahul003

Description ##\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-50\r\nMXNet Scala Inference Library. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis is to add refactored operators and MKLDNN.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nreference operator: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/compute_accidental_hits \r\nThe operator computes the matching pair (\"accidental hits\") between true classes and samples. \r\n```\r\nCompute the indices in ``sampled_candidates`` which matches ``true_classes``\r\nand return the mask for the matching positions.\r\n\r\nThe operator is used for removing sampled classes which happen to match target classes\r\n(i.e. accidental hits) for sampled softmax and sampled logistic. The mask has 0\r\nfor non-matching positions and 1 for matching ones.\r\n\r\nBoth inputs are expected to be 1-D. For example, let's say ``true_classes`` has shape (M,),\r\nand ``sampled_candidates`` has (N,), then the resulting mask will have shape (M, N).\r\nmask[i][j] = 1 iff true_classes[i] == sampled_candidates[j].\r\n\r\nExample::\r\n\r\n   true = [1,5,11]\r\n   sampled = [5,8,1,5,24]\r\n   compute_accidental_hits(true, sampled) = [[0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\r\n                                             [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\r\n                                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\r\n\r\n.. note:: `compute_accidental_hits` is only available on CPU and returns a compressed sparse row mask.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe main difference between this operator and the original tf operator is, the tf operator directly returns the indices of matching positions, which doesn't have a fixed shape. This operator instead returns a mask with all matching positions set to 1. \r\n\r\nThe resulting mask can be used with `nd.where` to set the values for the accidental hits. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with

Description ##\r\n\r\nOne of our python2 mxnet containers showed test failures in test_sparse_operator.py:test_sparse_storage_fallback  .  The root cause was traced to an out-of-bounds array reference of the 'axis' shape.  The only supported axis shapes for the given 'csr' storage type reduction are (0,) and (1,).  A check that the axis shape dimension is 1 before accessing shape[0] was added, solving the problem.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests,

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [

Description ##\r\nThe primary goal of this PR was to add exponential backoff to our http request.  This should be a good feature for customers with slow Internet connections, but I also hope it will help mitigate test issues such as: #9669.\r\n\r\nI noticed that we have a lot of duplicate code between test_utils.download and gluon.download.  I've attempted to combine these two functions, but can roll it back if they had a good reason to be separated.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n\r\nNote examples are affected by this change.  I've updated them so that they do not reference download functions that no longer exist.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- The tests require a new test dependency: requests_mock. Which may need to be added to the CI.  Due to this, this PR may require a little iteration before test work properly.  No rush to get it merged.\r\n- I've created a requirements.test.txt file for convenient installation of test deps.\r\n- NNVM will also need to be updated with a few new references in files tutorials/deploy_model_on_rasp.py and tutorials/from_mxnet.py.\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-01T17:58:09Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T19:50:11Z","closed_at":"2018-03-29T19:50:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"64710f4bd458d2dba0cab0e2071d2e918b3470bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":738857750,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3Mzg4NTc3NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/API%20change","name":"API

Description ##\r\nbump up project version to 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-01T06:11:48Z","updated_at":"2018-02-21T07:41:23Z","closed_at":"2018-02-21T07:41:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd2d809114a998b2583fae5df119c6bd984442a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9666/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9666/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9666/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/afaf62411889ed2f27799b684d461646255cd931","head":{"label":"CodingCat:change_scala_version_master","ref":"change_scala_version_master","sha":"afaf62411889ed2f27799b684d461646255cd931","user":{"login":"CodingCat","id":678008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODAwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/678008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44846253,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDg0NjI1Mw==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"CodingCat/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CodingCat","id":678008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODAwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/678008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat/mxnet","description":"

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis is to update project version in 1.1 branch (though I think we missed the chance to update 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT to 1.1.0)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-01T06:08:35Z","updated_at":"2018-03-07T04:41:57Z","closed_at":"2018-03-07T04:41:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cc62ef76e9bcc21f7091a3edede03f323cf4b529","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9664/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9664/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9664/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/9a27ccdd5ca361350907ac15bce785ecf769d834","head":{"label":"CodingCat:v1.1.0","ref":"v1.1.0","sha":"9a27ccdd5ca361350907ac15bce785ecf769d834","user":{"login":"CodingCat","id":678008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODAwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/678008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44846253,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDg0NjI1Mw==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"CodingCat/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CodingCat","id":678008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODAwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/678008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat/mxnet","description":"

Description ##\r\n\r\nchange the scala proj version for 1.1 branch\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-01T05:57:03Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T05:58:13Z","closed_at":"2018-02-01T05:58:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cjolivier01","id":11234557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01","html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9663/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9663/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9663/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/0dfb064ab703e646e20e0f0137ce4fd321c124fd","head":{"label":"CodingCat:change_scala_version_11","ref":"change_scala_version_11","sha":"0dfb064ab703e646e20e0f0137ce4fd321c124fd","user":{"login":"CodingCat","id":678008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODAwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/678008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/use

reverts commit 2cc2aa2272881326c8a50c6204aedd71e1821c3f.\r\nThis commit in question disables a large number of unit tests.\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have

Description ##\r\n- The weight decay term in Adagrad is incorrect. See https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/9363 for more details. \r\n- The sparse update is not fast enough for the language model I'm training. Moving the logic to cpp backend so that we don't suffer from blocking calls such as `RowSparseNDArray.indices` and `RowSparseNDArray.data`. \r\n\r\n@ZiyueHuang @piiswrong @sxjscience @cjolivier01 @szha \r\nCommit author is mistaken. Nvm. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis is to add the backward compatibility to compile MKLDNN.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-31T21:55:32Z","updated_at":"2018-03-24T05:52:52Z","closed_at":"2018-02-01T05:24:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"45bb449895a6aa04d3e3896f9e24c68e78adae83","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":738857750,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3Mzg4NTc3NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/API%20change","name":"API

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nUpdate mshadow with minor fixes and removed warnings.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-31T11:00:25Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T11:06:55Z","closed_at":"2018-02-01T11:06:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c730273fe750b8828d22c226e777ba4ff7b68875","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9642/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9642/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9642/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/597e66f25fddc088111c1397f108a2cbd219afcf","head":{"label":"larroy:submodules","ref":"submodules","sha":"597e66f25fddc088111c1397f108a2cbd219afcf","user":{"login":"larroy","id":928489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODQ4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/928489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy","html_url":"https://github.com/larroy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77059342,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzA1OTM0Mg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"larroy/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"larroy","id":928489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODQ4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/928489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy","html_url":"https://github.com/larroy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/larroy/mxnet","description":"This

lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] in acc, move the

Description ##\r\n* Example gluon image-classification now able to train imagenet properly. \r\n* More optimizations such as float16 and many more.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nAdd sparse support for regression operators (label can be of csr storage type).\r\n\r\nAdd `elemwise_add(default, csr) = default`\r\n\r\nAdd `broadcast_add(default, csr) = default`\r\n\r\ncc @eric-haibin-lin \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] sparse regression ops (label is of csr storage type), unittest\r\n- [x] `elemwise_add(default, csr) = default`, unittest\r\n- [x] `broadcast_add(default, csr) = default`, unittest\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-30T02:54:28Z","updated_at":"2018-03-03T12:13:49Z","closed_at":"2018-03-03T12:13:48Z","merged_at":"2018-03-03T12:13:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"dedfd2d60713319855c0b9df0aac57eee2d68f2d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"thirdwing","id":1547093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDcwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1547093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing","html_url":"https://github.com/thirdwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9625/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9625/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9625/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/2141eeaa71d7a64de4da1176e00ab33ffaa6958c","head":{"label":"ZiyueHuang:spreg","ref":"spreg","sha":"2141eeaa71d7a64de4da1176e00ab33ffaa6958c","user":{"login":"ZiyueHuang","id":24650346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjUwMzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24650346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang","html_url":"https://github.com/ZiyueHuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"62b9d48c87736ef1c398a2658953aee017ab9fc2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https:/

Description ##\r\nAccording to PEP3101, old type string formattings (%s) should re-writed as new type string formatting (\"{}\" and \".format()\")\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Old Type String Formattings converted New Type String Formattings in python/mxnet\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n-  PEP3101 generally says .format() is a better way to formatting strings.\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-27T16:59:39Z","updated_at":"2018-03-15T14:22:52Z","closed_at":"2018-03-15T14:22:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"555df5138c11d49bfd8236fe70218d0359ad93ec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9603/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9603/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9603/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/8da470171075277015eabef94ec93d938aaa847c","head":{"label":null,"ref":"btaskaya/stringformatting","sha":"8da470171075277015eabef94ec93d938aaa847c","user":null,"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e465cfa70d27eff9aeb0c83ba548fcf14aa81e1c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nuse ndarray for accuracy calculation.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] use ndarray instead of numpy for `metric.Accuracy` that fixes #9571 \r\n- [x] Improve accuracy doc that fixes #9582 \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Backward compatible.","created_at":"2018-01-27T00:37:00Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T23:54:46Z","closed_at":"2018-01-27T06:06:08Z","merged_at":"2018-01-27T06:06:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"f5f1b91ff972ad70e9131d3cd1d7408ddddb7684","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9583/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9583/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9583/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/99bc0345e44538686f133f4659eafc5c1f63cf14","head":{"label":"szha:metric_nd","ref":"metric_nd","sha":"99bc0345e44538686f133f4659eafc5c1f63cf14","user":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":92538952,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MjUzODk1Mg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"szha/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/szha/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

namespace change since it breaks backward compatibility and needs a major version bump up.\r\n\r\nRevert \"Refactor scala code/tests/examples/docs to use org.apache.mxnet (#9324)\"\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit deb25bca9803cac338faedb2eb14dfda22813b75.\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-26T22:08:03Z","updated_at":"2018-01-27T01:08:55Z","closed_at":"2018-01-27T01:08:42Z","merged_at":"2018-01-27T01:08:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"671df77d5dd84489536195d7ae06e7c9aa5969f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9579/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9579/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9579/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/7986078c84fb82de2d96c7e882a6e043face94d2","head":{"label":"nswamy:master","ref":"master","sha":"7986078c84fb82de2d96c7e882a6e043face94d2","user":{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":111612937,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTE2MTI5Mzc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"nswamy/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nSimplified some processes using the C API\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ N/A ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [X To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Helper functions for using the C API\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nAdded two functions that wrap existing functionality to make it easier to use in C / C++ applications.\r\n\r\nMXInitialise\r\nReadies mxnet for use. While this is possible with some other commands this function makes more sense and does not require unneeded variables.\r\n\r\nMXNDArrayLoadListFromMemory\r\nDuplicates MXNDArrayLoad but from a location in memory. This was needed for my work as we bundle models into another file.","created_at":"2018-01-26T10:55:04Z","updated_at":"2018-02-24T09:32:20Z","closed_at":"2018-02-24T09:32:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"83a85b931ebd1d2e6580784bb8c4dd6bbc761325","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"thirdwing","id":1547093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDcwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1547093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing","html_url":"https://github.com/thirdwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"sergeykolychev","id":25470168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDcwMTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25470168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev","html_url":"https://github.com/sergeykolychev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":738857750,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3Mzg4NTc3NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/API%20change","name":"API

Description ##\r\nAdding checksum test to check if file is downloaded fully otherwise raise exception\r\n@eric-haibin-lin \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

[scala] Remove finalizers for leakable resources\r\n\r\nFinalizers always run in a separate thread which is not controlled by the user.\r\nSince MXNet cannot be safely accessed from multiple threads, this causes memory\r\ncorruption. It is not safe to use finalizers in this way.\r\n\r\nThis change also adds some leaked object tracing, to allow leaks to be tracked.\r\nIt's easy to leak objects and despite warnings in the documentation leaks are\r\ncommon (even within the Scala API itself). The leak tracing is activated by a\r\nsystem property, as its runtime cost may be significant.\r\n\r\nWith the system property unset, the *first* leak of a type will be reported\r\n(without a trace) as a prompt to the developer to investigate.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Andre Tamm <tammtamm@amazon.com>\r\n\r\n* [scala] Fix various resource leaks\r\n\r\nThese leaks were diagnosed with the leak detection added in the previous\r\ncommit. This is not an exhaustive clean up but it allows predicting with a\r\nmodel from Scala at scale (hundreds of millions of comparisons) without a\r\nreported leak, as well as removing the most common errors when training using\r\nthe Module code.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Andre Tamm <tammtamm@amazon.com>\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-26T03:36:15Z","updated_at":"2018-01-26T07:52:00Z","closed_at":"2018-01-26T07:52:00Z","merged_at":"2018-01-26T07:52:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"f8f0b8a54e2b320dc91a244a3ce0290d64fd501a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9568/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9568/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9568/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/61a9ccb4b7ec85f0a0446883f93abb453e90391e","head":{"label":"nswamy:v0.11.0","ref":"v0.11.0","sha":"61a9ccb4b7ec85f0a0446883f93abb453e90391e","user":{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":111612937,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTE2MTI5Mzc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"nswamy/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

@zhreshold and @szha discovered that if MXNet were built without a suitable kernel binary or PTX for the GPU in the system, MXNet might produce incorrect results, rather than print an error message and exit.  The problem is that the \"no kernel for device\" error is synchronous to the kernel launch, and so needs to be identified by a cudaPeekAtLastError() or cudaGetLastError() call executed by the CPU thread launching the kernel.  This is best done right after the triple-chevron kernel-launch statement, and mshadow and much of MXNet already perform this check through the MSHADOW_CUDA_POST_KERNEL_CHECK() macro.\r\n\r\nThis PR expands use of MSHADOW_CUDA_POST_KERNEL_CHECK() to cover any triple-chevron kernel launches where it is missing, e.g. the generic Kernel::Launch and Kernel::LaunchEx routines.  I have verified the original scenario of an improperly built MXNet now exits with an error message.  I did not add a CI test, as this would have required creating a new test-only operator and hooking it to a kernel that fails at launch.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-25T03:39:23Z","updated_at":"2018-01-30T18:45:25Z","closed_at":"2018-01-30T18:45:25Z","merged_at":"2018-01-30T18:45:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"a0a52b38a9046a3ede20c900ff64154642e8e2da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9560/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9560/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9560/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/629b44ca840443313b767dd7b69c3924f22bb081","head":{"label":"DickJC123:sync_error_reporting","ref":"sync_error_reporting","sha":"629b44ca840443313b767dd7b69c3924f22bb081","user":{"login":"DickJC123","id":1703397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123","html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86116214,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjExNjIxNA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"DickJC123/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DickJC123","id":1703397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123","html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nAdded a new grad compression scheme.\r\nIt keeps track of the momentum on every worker and sends the sign vector of the momentum.\r\nThis is a somewhat hacky version of doing distributed version of the Signum optimizer: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/9220\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-25T02:53:10Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T07:01:58Z","closed_at":"2018-04-26T18:33:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5b45448d8c8551bc8af87995e1302bd415952df0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9558/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9558/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9558/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/bcff11a6fefaf35adbe24543c7e9a04f2194afdb","head":{"label":"yuxiangw:signum_with_grad_compression","ref":"signum_with_grad_compression","sha":"bcff11a6fefaf35adbe24543c7e9a04f2194afdb","user":{"login":"yuxiangw","id":7425195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MjUxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7425195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw","html_url":"https://github.com/yuxiangw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105683740,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU2ODM3NDA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"yuxiangw/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yuxiangw","id":7425195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MjUxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7425195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw","html_url":"https://github.com/yuxiangw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuxiangw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yuxiangw/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis PR implements model **quantization** by adopting the [TensorFlow approach](https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/quantization) with **calibration** by borrowing the idea from Nvidia's [TensorRT](http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2017/presentation/s7310-8-bit-inference-with-tensorrt.pdf). The focus of this work is on keeping quantized models (ConvNets for now) inference accuracy loss under control when compared to their corresponding FP32 models. It also provides a framework in MXNet for easily plugging in high-performance operators for low-bit operations generated by using [TVM](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm).\r\n\r\nThis is a joint work of @ZihengJiang and @reminisce.\r\n- @ZihengJiang implemented the model quantization flow and quantized operators by calling [cuDNN APIs](http://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-developer-guide/index.html#api-introduction) for convolution, pooling, and fully-connected operators.\r\n- @reminisce implemented the calibration flow and refactored the operator implementation into using nnvm interfaces as well as wrote unit tests and examples, designed user-level API, conducted benchmarks, and fixed bugs to make the code mergeable to MXNet master branch.\r\n\r\n## Details ##\r\nPlease see the following slides for more details on implementation and benchmark results.\r\n[quantization_github.pptx](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/files/1662073/quantization_github.pptx)\r\n\r\n## Code Structure ##\r\n- Backend: `src/operator/quantization/` contains quantized operators, quantization and calibration flow, and quantization util functions.\r\n- Frontend: `python/mxnet/quantization.py` contains one user API for generating quantized models from FP32 models.\r\n- Examples: `example/quantization/` contains examples of generating quantized models and using quantized models for inference.\r\n- Unit tests: `tests/python/quantization/` contains unit tests for quantization.\r\n\r\n## Notes ##\r\n- Since we have used cuDNN for implementing the quantized operators, the quantized models generated in the examples of this PR can only run on the Nvidia GPUs supporting the [dp4a instruction](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/mixed-precision-programming-cuda-8/) for inference. We performed our benchmarks on [AWS P3 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p3/).\r\n- The inference speed of the quantized models is about 50% slower than FP32 models. This is majorly resulted from three transpose operations in the quantized convolution operator to transform data layouts between NCHW and NHWC in order to call [`cudnnConvolutionForward`](http://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-developer-guide/index.html#cudnnConvolutionForward). In addition, we have noticed that even without transposing data layouts, the INT8 convolution of NHWC is slower than FP32 of NCHW for big images such as `(64, 56, 56)`. In the future, we hope to leverage the strength of [TVM](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm) to generate high-performance INT8 operators to replace the current implementation of calling cuDNN for quantized convolution.\r\n- The unit tests of quantization are put under `tests/python/quantization` because it needs a P3 instance to run. @marcoabreu is working on setting up the testing environment. Once it's done, we will submit the unit tests under that folder to a different label from the commonly used one.\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank all the following people for discussion, suggestion,

Description ##\r\nAdd three word-embeddings from fasttext for english.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add 3 embeddings to available pretrained\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Tested offline. The embeddings are large so it's not suitable for adding to

Description ##\r\nBuilds are ARM64 with CUDA 8 support.  Dependencies based on Jetpack 3.1.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this
