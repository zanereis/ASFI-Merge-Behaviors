now, building wheels is failing because it tries to upload an artifact for the multi-arch wheels with the same name as the regular wheels. Previously this worked silently and one was dropped. This fixes that issue by appending `-aarch64` to the multi-arch wheels and makes sure that it gets uploaded to gcs as well.\r\n\r\nExample succeeding now - https://github.com/apache/beam/actions/runs/7266076148\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is possible for the SpannerAccessor to be in the process of being closed at the same time as its refcount is being increased.\r\n\r\nThis would lead to java.lang.IllegalStateException: Pool has been closed errors.\r\n\r\nThese 2 functions are only called in `@Setup` and `@Teardown`  functions of SpannerIO, so high performance is not needed and a global lock is adequate.\r\n\r\nIn a large

This plugin is now built to Java 11 class file format. It requires Gradle to run on Java 11 or later. (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/1c1955efc33a80498d5c8f31937bd8f6a090a5a9\">1c1955e</a>)\nb. Enable Java Tool Chain support by default (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/c94b8865d844064f4900d156192c0ea448277854\">c94b886</a>). To disable it, set <code>useJavaToolchains = false</code> in the <code>spotbugs</code> extension.\nc. Drop support for Gradle 7.0 (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/4b0f8006fdfe6345a74edb356e3c3b1da13225f1\">4b0f800</a>). The convention API provides replacement from 7.1 and later, so we use 7.1 as minimal required version.\nd. Remove deprecated methods <code>SpotBugsTask.getEnabledReports()</code> and <code>SpotBugsTask.getFirstEnabledReport</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/2ab3c45bf6215ba1f35e87427893d4c97a7190bc\">2ab3c45</a>)\ne. The <code>effort</code> and <code>reportLevel</code> properties of <code>SpotBugsTask</code> and <code>SpotBugsExtension</code> now accept enum values instead of String instances. Read the following notes for detail.</p>\n<h3>Note for Groovy buildscripts</h3>\n<p>Groovy buildscripts should use use <code>valueOf(String)</code> method explicitly for <code>effort</code> and <code>reportLevel</code> properties of <code>SpotBugsTask</code> and <code>SpotBugsExtension</code>. For example:</p>\n<pre lang=\"groovy\"><code>// before (v5)\nspotbugs {\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

This plugin is now built to Java 11 class file format. It requires Gradle to run on Java 11 or later. (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/1c1955efc33a80498d5c8f31937bd8f6a090a5a9\">1c1955e</a>)\nb. Enable Java Tool Chain support by default (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/c94b8865d844064f4900d156192c0ea448277854\">c94b886</a>). To disable it, set <code>useJavaToolchains = false</code> in the <code>spotbugs</code> extension.\nc. Drop support for Gradle 7.0 (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/4b0f8006fdfe6345a74edb356e3c3b1da13225f1\">4b0f800</a>). The convention API provides replacement from 7.1 and later, so we use 7.1 as minimal required version.\nd. Remove deprecated methods <code>SpotBugsTask.getEnabledReports()</code> and <code>SpotBugsTask.getFirstEnabledReport</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/2ab3c45bf6215ba1f35e87427893d4c97a7190bc\">2ab3c45</a>)\ne. The <code>effort</code> and <code>reportLevel</code> properties of <code>SpotBugsTask</code> and <code>SpotBugsExtension</code> now accept enum values instead of String instances. Read the following notes for detail.</p>\n<h3>Note for Groovy buildscripts</h3>\n<p>Groovy buildscripts should use use <code>valueOf(String)</code> method explicitly for <code>effort</code> and <code>reportLevel</code> properties of <code>SpotBugsTask</code> and <code>SpotBugsExtension</code>. For example:</p>\n<pre lang=\"groovy\"><code>// before (v5)\nspotbugs {\n    effort = 'default'\n    reportLevel = 'default'\n}\n<p>// after (v6)\nspotbugs {\neffort = Effort.valueOf('DEFAULT')\nreportLevel = Confidence.valueOf('DEFAULT')\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

user-agent string was added into gcsio in [PR 27211](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/27211). However, due to the fact that google-cloud-storage<2.13.0 does not support extra header, we did not keep user-agent during the migration [PR 29360](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/29360).\r\n\r\nNow, as we upgrade google-cloud-storage dependency to the latest version (2.14.0), we can support user-agent string in the request header again.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
