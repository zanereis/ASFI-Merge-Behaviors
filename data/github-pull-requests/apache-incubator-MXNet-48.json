your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-21T18:54:49Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T09:17:29Z","closed_at":"2018-12-11T00:49:24Z","merged_at":"2018-12-11T00:49:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"75d1d4fec7ca69b836ebf4b71bd7a1a0ea9e5e2f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-21T01:42:32Z","updated_at":"2018-12-13T01:05:48Z","closed_at":"2018-12-13T00:56:40Z","merged_at":"2018-12-13T00:56:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"25be62f02a32b152d8b7baaa52669299285600ff","assignee":{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NzQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-testing","name":"pr-awaiting-testing","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nCurrently MXNet optimizers are invoked 1 weight at a time. This leads to a lot of synchronization overhead, as updates (especially for convolutions and batchnorm) tend to be small, but each one needs to by synchronized upon.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] ability to control `update_on_kvstore` value via environment variable `MXNET_UPDATE_ON_KVSTORE` (default is 1, which is consistent with the current behavior)\r\n- [x] if `update_on_kvstore` is False, in the case of SGD optimizer it attempts to bundle updates of multiple weights together and launches a single kernel to perform them all, reducing the number of kernel calls and synchronizations.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Current test_sgd automatically uses the new code paths, so no new tests are needed.\r\n- Code does not support sparse arrays and it will fall back to not aggregated calls when it encounters sparse array in the bundle of weights/gradients\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-21T00:05:26Z","updated_at":"2019-03-09T00:32:21Z","closed_at":"2019-01-24T06:32:32Z","merged_at":"2019-01-24T06:32:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"0a45e1a222637c7dee29511cbfc43e594571933b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

PR refactors our Jenkinsfiles that are used in the PR stage for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Work around issues with Jenkinsfiles being too large: https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-37984\r\n2. Improve the readability of the Jenkinsfiles. Now you can clearly tell which jobs are being run while implementation details are hidden in another file. Also, this allows code re-usage.\r\n3. Increase the speed of the PR pipeline. We will now have multiple pipelines which run in parallel. This reduces the critical path since a stage no longer has to wait for the slowest job before being able to move forward.\r\n\r\nTest jobs to validate these changes are available at http://jenkins.mxnet-ci-dev.amazon-ml.com/view/test-marco-mxnet/\r\n\r\nThe status report would then look as follows:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18629099/48802247-f628e380-ed0e-11e8-91b4-5d8f857efcda.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far, I have not refactored other pipelines. This would be done in a follow-up PR.","created_at":"2018-11-20T20:21:04Z","updated_at":"2018-11-21T17:24:44Z","closed_at":"2018-11-21T11:07:18Z","merged_at":"2018-11-21T11:07:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"d8030c576bb29dc8c1418052a9c6a66c8cd2f5e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

PR adds support for `float32` `linalg.gemm` and `linalg.gemm2` ops to make use of Tensor Cores via implicit casting. It is motivated by there being no way of doing `GEMM` with Tensor Core support in MXNet currently (`linalg.gemm` and `linalg.gemm2` don't support `float16`, and `batch_dot` is super slow for `float16` #11796). It is critical for applications such as Transformers to have a fast version of this operator.\r\n\r\nA simple benchmark shows significant speedups on a V100:\r\n```\r\ndef benchmark(dtype, dev, shape):\r\n    ctx = mx.gpu()\r\n    a = mx.nd.random.normal(0, 1, shape=shape, ctx=dev, dtype=dtype)\r\n    b = mx.nd.random.normal(0, 1, shape = shape, ctx=dev, dtype=dtype)\r\n    s = mx.symbol.linalg.gemm2(mx.sym.Variable(\"a\"), mx.sym.Variable(\"b\"), transpose_b=False, alpha=1.0)\r\n    e = s.bind(dev, {\"a\":a,\"b\":b})\r\n    \r\n    # warmup\r\n    e.forward()\r\n    e.outputs[0].asnumpy()\r\n\r\n    begin = time.time()\r\n    for i in range(100):\r\n        e.forward()\r\n    e.outputs[0].asnumpy()\r\n\r\n    end = time.time()\r\n    print(end - begin)\r\n    return None\r\nshape = (64, 1024, 1024)\r\nos.environ[\"MXNET_CUDA_TENSOR_OP_MATH_ALLOW_CONVERSION\"] = \"0\"\r\nbenchmark(\"float32\", mx.gpu(), shape)\r\nos.environ[\"MXNET_CUDA_TENSOR_OP_MATH_ALLOW_CONVERSION\"] = \"1\"\r\nbenchmark(\"float32\", mx.gpu(), shape)\r\n```\r\ngives `1.153s` and `0.3957s` (so a factor 2.9x speedup). Its also around 50% faster letting cuBLAS do the casting than using MXNet ops to cast to `float16`, do GEMM in `float16`, and then back to `float32`.\r\n\r\n@eric-haibin-lin

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nEnable different shape input for inference. This is also a **critical bug-fix** for the Executor since there are flaws in the inference with shape support.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Scala backend is already capable of handling different shape input. After some testing, there is no significant performance degrade however there may be some unforeseen problems such as the limitation of acceptable shape range, etc. This feature will be useful with models such as Seq2Seq to allow sentences with different length to feed in.\r\nIn order to enable this:\r\n```\r\n-Dmxnet.disableShapeCheck=true\r\n```\r\n@yzhliu @nswamy @gigasquid @andrewfayres @piyushghai @zachgk \r\nHistorical commits that allow this:\r\n\r\nPython forward accept multiple shapes\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/6805\r\nScala Sync change with Python Module API\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/7246\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-20T05:22:22Z","updated_at":"2018-12-13T01:07:52Z","closed_at":"2018-11-30T00:16:45Z","merged_at":"2018-11-30T00:16:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"0038473e799bccd77f57718eb5f8af28b81c8284","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nContribute an Example for performing a task with Audio data that demonstrates the following abilities: \r\n- to be able to load audio (only .wav files supported currently) files and make an AudioDataset (NDArrays),\r\n- apply some popular audio transforms on the audio data( example scaling, MEL, MFCC etc.),\r\n- load the Dataset using Gluon's DataLoader, train a neural network ( Ex: MLP) with this transformed audio dataset,\r\n- perform a simple audio data related task such as sounds classification - 1 audio clip with 1 label( Multiclass sound classification problem).\r\n- have an end to end example for a sample Audio multi class classification task (Urban Sounds Classification)\r\n\r\n**Note** : This example uses AudioFolderDataset and applies transforms to extract features from audio file and does a classification task. Current design of the AudioFolderDataset is below:\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Gluon+-+Audio\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove

Description ##\r\nMKLDNN by default caches mkldnn memory and primitives to performance reasons. The cache looks uses input shape as a key. However, when models accept variable size inputs, the cache constantly grows and is not cleared. A flag is added MXNET_MKLDNN_CACHE_ENABLED that will disable this.\r\n\r\nIn a future PR, we can clear the cache automatically if it growths a certain length.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA

Description ##\r\n\r\nCurrent cub submodule is pointing to DLMC's cub repo, the repo doesn't have customization of nvidia's cub project. The historic reason to use DLMC's cub is:\r\n1. check out of nvidia's cub project takes long time\r\n2. There was force push in nvidia's cub project broke mxnet submodule link.\r\n\r\nSince both above issue has been resolved on Nvidia side, we should move back to Nvidia's cub project to reduce upgrade/merge effort.\r\n\r\nThe proposal has been discussed on: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/6c10ab4746ac15b08fb5ac7281abdfdfcd5b534fd3838200941cd2ca@%3Cdev.mxnet.apache.org%3E. \r\n\r\nDirectly change submodule URL will impact every developer.\r\n\"git submodule update\" won't work, developer has to use\r\n\"git submodule sync\" first.\r\n\r\nTo avoid impact every developer, remove CUB and add a new\r\n\"nvidia_cub\" to workaround this issue.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-19T17:59:27Z","updated_at":"2019-11-16T19:07:30Z","closed_at":"2019-03-31T23:38:16Z","merged_at":"2019-03-31T23:38:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"b6eac1da01d4ad4c260f0576860148ad11444054","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

found some multi-processing-related issues in the Gluon  DataLoader.\r\n\r\n 1) Each time a _MultiWorkerIter shuts down, it could leave some dangling processes. The shutdown mechanism could not guarantee that all worker processes can be terminated. As a result, after running for several epochs, more and more dangling processes will stay there.\r\n\r\n  This problem barely happens during training. In this case, there is a decent time interval between the last-batch data prefetching and the _MultiWorkerIter's shutting down).\r\n  But the problem frequently happens 1) when I stop the iter before the end of an epoch, and 2) when I use the DataLoader for a data loading service and load the data as fast as possible. In both cases, the time interval between the most recent data prefetching and the iter shutdown are short. I guess that the _MultiWorkerIter iter is unable to shut down properly during active data prefetching.\r\n\r\n  To fix this, I explicitly terminate the worker processes inside the shutdown function.\r\n\r\n  2) When loading data fast (still mostly during testing and data serving), there seems to be a risk of data racing. The data iter uses a _MultiWorkerIter to cache prefetched data, but the dict does not seem to be thread-safe for concurrent inserting and deleting elements. So occasionally, the data can be missing from the  dict.\r\n\r\n  To prevent this, I use a scope lock to guard the dict access.\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is

for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if

Description ##\r\nThe PR includes an example that demonstrates the inference workflow using C++ API.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [y] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API

Description ##\r\nWe can store a graph as an CSR matrix. In this case, the value in the matrix is the edge id starting from 0. These operators run on such special CSR matrices. This is joint work with @HyperZealot and @aksnzhy \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-15T21:53:33Z","updated_at":"2018-11-25T05:47:44Z","closed_at":"2018-11-24T01:18:16Z","merged_at":"2018-11-24T01:18:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"388a5f483483b1dc07b2f46f182bd00fa7505732","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis is the first pass at creating the website documentation needed for the new Java API release.\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-13289/10/index.html\r\nhttp://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-13289/10/install/java_setup.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-15T20:16:37Z","updated_at":"2018-11-25T18:11:37Z","closed_at":"2018-11-25T18:11:37Z","merged_at":"2018-11-25T18:11:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"d412f4faee862c0bccf608b9be440a5a4bccc3fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

our Docker caching, the APT cache is being persisted as well. Due to the inconsistent use of ``apt update``, this might lead to the Docker cache being refreshed partially while still using a stale APT cache.\r\n\r\nBy running ``apt update`` before every ``apt install``, we ensure the repository is always in the latest state if that layer has to be refreshed.\r\n\r\nthe ``|| true`` is added due to stability reasons. APT is not 100% available and we had problems because of that. By swallowing that error, we increase the tolerance. If the package is **really** missing during the installation stage (because it's not in the APT cache and updating the cache failed due to server errors), we will throw the error anyway. If we still have a good cache with the proper package present even though the update failed, this means that the update wasn't actually necessary and that we can still proceed. We already employed this mechanism in some places. Now we're making everything equal to harden all install scripts.","created_at":"2018-11-15T18:30:45Z","updated_at":"2018-11-17T18:01:35Z","closed_at":"2018-11-15T22:07:24Z","merged_at":"2018-11-15T22:07:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"226f9cbed04269c1233c8f4b3ae95d8ec15a8126","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13285/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13285/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/13285/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/03ebd0fa5dfd9e949ee65e2f33a59cd9e89b05e1","head":{"label":"marcoabreu:force-update-apt-cache","ref":"force-update-apt-cache","sha":"03ebd0fa5dfd9e949ee65e2f33a59cd9e89b05e1","user":{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113563686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTM1NjM2ODY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"marcoabreu/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n1. Fix: #9417\r\nRoot Cause:\r\nPassing correct padding (1, 1) in Pooling in InceptionFactoryB\r\nReference python implementation, `pad=(1, 1)`\r\nTested example working fine.\r\n\r\n2. fix some models not training: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13243, https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/12966, https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/8108\r\nRoot Cause:\r\nWrong logic for gradient requirement: symbols with name length 3 and 4 won't have gradients\r\nChanged to:\r\nSymbols names contains \"data\" or \"label\" should not be required for gradients\r\n\r\n3. Added parameter initialization same as python versions\r\n\r\n4. added inception-bn to unit tests\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nsee description\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this

Description ##\r\nIt is the PR I took over from @zheng-da at #12400. All credits go to Da Zheng.\r\n\r\nThis PR relaxes the constraint on NDArrays that shape used to be pre-determined. For unittesting, this PR introduces an operator called `BooleanMask` in contrib, which is a practical use case that actually produces dynamic shape. Note that the support for boolean mask is very experimental, which only allows 2-d inputs, and 1-d mask, because it serves only the functionality of testing. We could improve its better in future PRs. \r\n\r\nThis is an initial step for the roadmap #12732.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Introducing new methods in NDArray allowing delayed assignment of their shapes.\r\n- [x] Introducing boolean mask operator, which we believe will be useful in the future.\r\n- [x] Add unit test.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nNo comments.\r\n\r\n## TODO ##\r\n- [x] Refactor the boolean index operator\r\n- [x] Write backward pass of the boolean index operator\r\n- [x] Test coverage\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-15T13:57:18Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T07:41:49Z","closed_at":"2018-11-20T07:01:56Z","merged_at":"2018-11-20T07:01:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"779bdc5e7ee3abd6a2d23e8bd97d47fc08ae6bc5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2018-11-15T06:34:22Z","updated_at":"2018-12-13T01:07:41Z","closed_at":"2018-11-15T19:36:34Z","merged_at":"2018-11-15T19:36:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"52bead068c8b120c0eccd42d46a0b0afab5420cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13281/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13281/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/13281/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/2de5f50bdf6d534ae1a839c4bb1c40f990848d88","head":{"label":"lanking520:ndarray-clean","ref":"ndarray-clean","sha":"2de5f50bdf6d534ae1a839c4bb1c40f990848d88","user":{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123362138,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjMzNjIxMzg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"lanking520/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- indentation changes\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Fixes the following

$JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-14T19:43:36Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T17:58:21Z","closed_at":"2018-11-20T17:58:21Z","merged_at":"2018-11-20T17:58:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"5042ec3bc8b8297855d06488dad30981afacaf8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nFix Sphinx errors that appear on local execution of make html.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Correct section title in io.py\r\n- Correct prefix usage in conv_rnn_cell.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nFixes the following

Description ##\r\nFixes sphinx build errors.\r\nThe java-script was breaking the pages from being redered, since sphinx seems to remove target id's when `:noindex:` is used in `automodule`. This crashes the javascript since the target-id retrieved in the script is undefined and the script seems to use it to remove the leading `mxnet.` from the target-ID. I added a check to do this substitution only if the given `taget-id` is  valid. \r\n\r\n1. This renders the pages if `:noindex:` is used in sphinx pages. \r\n2. If all the members in the `automodule` are under `:noindex:`, the link anchors between `autosummary` and `automodule` might not work, since these `automodule` doesn't generate any ID for the `autosummary` tables to link to. This was the side effect that I saw, but this is still better than having a broken page.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also addressed a few `:noindex:` warnings from docs where a few members were being referenced multiple times in the doc. \r\n\r\nFixes #13028\r\nFixes #13029\r\nFixes #13024\r\nFixes #13250\r\n \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-13T07:31:09Z","updated_at":"2018-11-13T23:52:31Z","closed_at":"2018-11-13T23:46:15Z","merged_at":"2018-11-13T23:46:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"f79bb18a060f796ebe3cb46d0c607b6576e77cc0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nAdd hybridize option and visualize the network in mxnet>=1.3.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add hybridize option. Hybridize on RNN layers is newly available in mxnet>=1.3.\r\n- [x] Add model export to mxboard. The end result is visualized via tensorboard and added to README.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- The change is back-ward compatible. Especially, hybridize_optional would be an empty list in mxnet<1.3.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-13T04:22:53Z","updated_at":"2019-02-07T17:45:38Z","closed_at":"2019-02-07T17:45:38Z","merged_at":"2019-02-07T17:45:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"506a25c71cf1d861c957b61e5ab7f142ac094d5a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":708228884,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgyMjg4ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Gluon","name":"Gluon","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nCherry pick @mdespriee change to Java API. Applied minor change in order to make it compatible with Java API Generation\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-13T01:23:11Z","updated_at":"2018-12-13T01:07:33Z","closed_at":"2018-11-13T21:57:18Z","merged_at":"2018-11-13T21:57:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"fb4cad9dadac1010a16435ccb88f82b784d6cd91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nPhase 1 \r\n\r\nAs a user, I would like to have an out of the box feature of audio data loader and some popular audio transforms in MXNet, that would allow me : \r\n- to be able to load audio (only .wav files supported currently) files and make a Gluon AudioDataset (NDArrays),\r\n- apply some popular audio transforms on the audio data( example scaling, MEL, MFCC etc.),\r\n- load the Dataset using Gluon's DataLoader, train a neural network ( Ex: MLP) with this transformed audio dataset,\r\n- perform a simple audio data related task such as sounds classification - 1 audio clip with 1 label( Multiclass sound classification problem).\r\n- have an end to end example for a sample Audio multi class classification task (Urban Sounds Classification)\r\n\r\n**Note**: The plan is to have a working piece of this model with an example into the contrib package of MXNet before it is agreed upon to move this implementation to the gluon.data module.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness.\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n- [x] Example contributed\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] AudioFolderDataset(gluon.contrib.data.audio.datasets), \r\n- [x] audio transforms (gluon.contrib.data.audio.transforms)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This PR is a WIP. I will be adding tests for the modules added along with the documentation and an example(Notebook or a python script)\r\n- This feature allows to take first step in audio data related tasks and needs to be extended for more generic as well as advanced use cases - (Reason for contributing in the gluon.contrib package)\r\n- Opened this PR for early feedback regarding:\r\n   - **librosa** - which is a dependency for this for audio load and feature extraction like mfcc, scale, mel etc.. This may have to be listed as a dependency in the CI script, or the tests will fail. Suggestions about where to include this or a work around is appreciated.\r\n   - Design [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Gluon+-+Audio)- Feedback is required - Dev list

PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nAdd `image_shape` in argument\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-13T01:05:45Z","updated_at":"2018-11-15T19:46:16Z","closed_at":"2018-11-15T19:46:16Z","merged_at":"2018-11-15T19:46:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"1ef83c953ff58bf8c444ad84926a1e84745aa00f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review

commit.\r\n\r\nhttp://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/incubator-mxnet/detail/v1.3.x/82/pipeline\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds few options to BilinearResize2D operator. This options are needed for Fully-Convolutional realization of nets, that uses bilinear resize. The added modes are \"odd_scale\", \"like\" and few options to change height and width of tensor to even or odd: \"to_even_down\", \"to_even_up\", \"to_odd_down\", \"to_odd_up\".\r\nSuch transformations couldn't be done in other ways because when we use symbolic models we can't get tensors shapes from Python or any other frontend.\r\nWith these mods it is is possible to realize segmentation network ICNet that could work with input of any size.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- \"Odd-scale\" is for getting odd height and width, for example for pooling, which is recommended by authors of DeepLab and ICNet. So if we have tensor with shape (n, c, 65, 33) we can resize it to (n, c, 33, 17) with parameters (scale_height=0.5, scale_width=0.5, mode='odd_scale') and back with parameters (scale_height=2, scale_width=2, mode='odd_scale')\r\n- \"Like\" is also useful mode which could be used in decoders of segmentation networks. It resizes first input to the shape of second input.\r\n- \"to_even_...\" and \"to_odd_...\" modes changes height and width to even and odd value respectively adding or subtracting 1 from h and w if required.\r\n- Changes in visualization.py are needed for normal graph visualization when using mode \"Like\". In this mode there are two input nodes, but actually one of them is used only for getting desired shape. Information about it in graph isn't important but graph becomes too complicated. So this change just deletes dependence from \"like\"-node.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- The changes are almost backward-compatible: since we added mode \"like\", the operator takes two inputs, so in other modes second positional argument in Python (or other) should be None, and height and width became third and forth positional arguments respectively. So, some code, which used height and width as positional argument will not work.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-12T16:56:22Z","updated_at":"2019-08-14T14:17:40Z","closed_at":"2019-05-05T09:53:15Z","merged_at":"2019-05-05T09:53:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"b30949f3bf3606477a89955dc37f58b6eb285d99","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gigasquid","id":340299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid","html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/
