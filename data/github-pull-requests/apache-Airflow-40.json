Unfortunately MSSQL doesn't have a REPLACE or an UPSERT SQL syntax.  In order to achieve the same functionality, you have to use the MERGE INTO statement.  In order to be able to use that statement in a dynamic way, you have to get the primary keys of the table you want to replace into.  This means the current implementation of the _generate_insert_sql with the _replace_statement_format field won't work, as some assumptions have been made there which makes it impossible to achieve the same with the current _generate_insert_sql implementation of the DbApiHook.\r\n\r\nSo to make it work for MsSqlHook, I've override the _generate_insert_sql method in the MsSqlHook and also added a method named get_primary_keys which dynamically retrieves the PK associated to the given table as this will be needed for the MERGE INTO SQL statement.  If the _generate_insert_sql method is called for insert statement, then the original implementation is being called, otherwise the MSSQL specific implementation is being executed.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage is that you can benefit from fast performance while upserting with the executemany option.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

PR is based on https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/40819\r\n\r\nThis adds support for getting lineage directly from Object Store's `ObjectStoragePath`. \r\n\r\nNot every operation is being tracked, only those that modify or read the files, not the metadata. \r\n\r\nCopy/rename/move operations are being tracked internally, while for tracking reads and writes there's `TrackingFileWrapper` - proxy that collects reads and writes.\r\n\r\nThis allows also tracking data reads/writes from other systems that accept file APIs - for example, from Object Store tutorial in Airflow:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nbase = ObjectStoragePath(\"s3://aws_default@airflow-tutorial-data/\")\r\n(...)\r\n\r\npath = base / f\"air_quality_{formatted_date}.parquet\"\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame(response.json()).astype(aq_fields)\r\nwith path.open(\"wb\") as file:\r\n    df.to_parquet(file)\r\n```\r\n\r\ncan generate lineage.\r\n\r\n`FileTransferOperator` already has OL support (AIP-53 one).","created_at":"2024-07-16T23:50:30Z","updated_at":"2024-08-02T13:40:22Z","closed_at":"2024-07-23T16:45:32Z","merged_at":"2024-07-23T16:45:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"6adae0b425adac1f829bd1f38afe22697eaa3742","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eladkal","id":45845474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODQ1NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45845474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal","html_url":"https://github.com/eladkal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"o-nikolas","id":65743084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzQzMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65743084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas","html_url":"https://github.com/o-nikolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url"

think this one should finally fix the flaky test. The issue with it was that in Pytest parsing the test might occur a long time before executing it - depending how many tests are run between and how slow the test run.\r\n\r\nThe original test calculated the reference time at parsing time and it assumed on hour ahead (when minutes where 0-ed were enough) for the \"deferral\" to happen. But if parsing was executed (thus reference time calculation happened) before end of hour and execution after end hour, then the +1 hour from beginning of the reference hour already passed.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to move the reference time calculation to inside the test, so that it is not calculated a long time before the test is run.\r\n\r\nThe test runs on public runners are generally slower \"per container\", that's why it happened more frequently on public runners.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Currently I have to reimplement the logic present in Airflow on OpenLineage backend side, and keep it in sync with a particular Airflow version, e.g.:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/2.9.0/airflow/models/taskinstance.py#L1719-L1731\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/2.1.0/airflow/models/taskinstance.py#L524-L528\r\n\r\nAdd TaskInstances's `log_url` field to `AirflowRunFacet`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

an overlooked part of #39616\r\n\r\nCurrently, the _get_count function in sensor_helper.py does not return the number of the Dag Runs where all the sub tasks in a task group for all the datetimes given in the dttm_filter have succeeded, but instead just returns 1 if they are all complete. However, this is not the expected behaviour wherever this function is used (namely in the run function in WorkflowTrigger and poke function in ExternalTaskSensor)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

are facing some issues with linking back to older DagRuns, for example following the Triggered DAG link for a TriggerDagRunOperator, or by following links from the Dag Run List view. Various tickets have been made and fixes have been applied, but I still see the same issue in the current main branch  when running it on my laptop. I currently have a branch that fixes it for me by putting back the execution_date in the url, but I also see a [comment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/40336/files#diff-800088a475d2b93df93b7b497aba69eeb0485005be1d4dd5b414c46ab1c68023R226) that this is something that will/should be removed in Airflow 3.0. \r\n\r\nSo I’m curious what you think the right way of solving is. On Slack it was recommended to start a PR and discuss it here. If we don’t want to have the execution_date in url’s anymore, I guess something should be solved that the correct DagRun can be referred to by its RunId only. If that is indeed the direction I should go to, where should that be done?\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

tests have been triggered when core airflow changed. This has been done in order to avoid some core changes that would break providers, however running provider tests - especially including compatibility tests takes a long time now and especially after we switched the committer PRs to run using public runners - adding compatibility tests to be run whenever provider tests ar run also does not help with speed.\r\nInstead we should defer to the \"canary\" build to catch such changes and rather than actively check all providers in PRs, the \"canary\" builds should be enough to catch any of such changes.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

modifications to the existing `PythonVirtualenvOperator` to upgrade a few areas. \r\nI am currently working on deploying Airflow on a k8s cluster using Helm, and using the `venv_cache_path` of PythonVirtualenvOperator to utilize Airflow in a multi-python environment.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is possible to pre-configure Python and use ExternalPythonOperator, in a Helm environment this would require building the image first. \r\nTherefore, we typically use the PythonVirtualenvOperator along with the `venv_cache_path`.\r\n> A major advantage is the ability to set the requirements directly within the DAG file, not by building k8s pod image.\r\n> It's a great feature!\r\n\r\nSince Python-executable settings are often shared and reused among various tasks, I used to define a custom PythonVirtualenvOperator, but I thought it could be improved with a hook.\r\nIt could allow control via the web UI. \r\n\r\n### Ideas\r\n\r\nJust like SparkSubmitHook and SparkSubmitOperator, I separated the methods embedded in PythonVirtualenvOperator into a PythonVirtualenvHook, allowing the operator to call the hook.\r\nI will upload the draft first and add the test code later.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Connection edit screenshot\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf992e28-c740-401d-abae-68ee5ef3359e)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty

Unfortunately, these calls are only available starting from Boto3 version 1.34.134, in provider config the boto3 configured >=1.30.90, but when the image gets build the version is coming 1.34.131. so in this cant use the above api.\r\n\r\nSo thought of updating it later the code to use the describe_application_operation API when the boto3 becomes >=1.34.134.

though there was a PR #39642 and linked several others there is a serious regression to have valid and working links for older DAG runs pointing to grid.\r\nI got a report for such a bug during the week and was stumbling into this with a lot of follow-up issues. I think the grid UI needs to be in general improved towards this but could not find a good entry point.\r\n\r\nNevertheless following other PRs attempting to fix I relalized that passing `base_date` helps until the Grid properly is able to handle older run calls. But the `TaskInstance.log_url` property does not generate a compatible URL.\r\n\r\nThis PR adjusts the URL generated to be working for older runs.\r\n\r\nAs I had my hands on it, optimized the map_index off if task is not mapped.","created_at":"2024-07-13T09:11:15Z","updated_at":"2024-07-23T09:06:33Z","closed_at":"2024-07-13T14:55:59Z","merged_at":"2024-07-13T14:55:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"9c13c0939acc6b7dbd856c12c6eba12182fe00a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Bug Fixes"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

is an entrypoint to running tasks on executors other than the backfill and scheduler jobs, that is the cli command tasks run_task. If neither --local or --raw are provided, an executor instance is created to run the task. Before this change, that was always the default executor. This change updates that logic to check if the task instance has been configured to run on a specific executor, if so, load that executor to run the task instead of the default.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

The duration includes only run duration and is stored as seconds. During rendering the y-axis value is converted to hh:mm:ss format along with the tooltip. In task duration for a specific task we can calculate max duration but calculating it across all instances means when an outlier task ran in hours that takes only seconds then deselecting the task from legend will still display all others in hours. Clicking on the data point takes the user to specific task instance detail tab.\r\n\r\nI am facing an issue with moment import which I couldn't figure out.

to the ds_format method in macros to be able to specify a locale so datetimes can be formatted with the corresponding language.\r\n\r\nFor example following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nds_format('05', '%m', '%b', 'en_US')\r\n> 'May'\r\nds_format('05', '%m', '%b', 'nl_BE') \r\n> 'mei'\r\nds_format('12/07/2024', '%d/%m/%Y', '%A %d %B %Y', 'en_US')\r\n> 'Friday 12 July 2024'\r\nds_format('12/07/2024', '%d/%m/%Y', '%A %d %B %Y', 'nl_BE')\r\n> 'vrijdag 12 juli 2024'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be very handy in jinja expressions where you need for example specifiy different formatting for multiple languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

PR resolves #39997\r\nWhen running with local executor, get_parsing_context would return None regardless of the parsing context. This leads to longer loading times when a lot of dynamic DAGs are generated from a single dagfile. Changed local_executor.py to execute the task with the _airflow_parsing_context_manager.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

DatabricksWorkflowPlugin provides with links in the Airflow\r\nUI for tasks that allow us to see the Databricks job run in the\r\nDatabricks workspace, additionally it also provides link to \r\nrepair task(s) in the workflow.\r\n\r\nDatabricks does not allow repairing jobs with single tasks launched\r\noutside the workflow, hence we just provide the link for the job run.\r\n\r\nWithin the workflow, for each of the task, we provide links to the\r\njob run and repair link for the single task\r\n\r\nAnd at the workflow level, for the job launch task, we provide a\r\nlink to repair all failed tasks along with the link for job run in \r\nthe Databricks workspace that can be used to monitor the job\r\nin the Databricks account.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR is the second attempt on adding the DatabricksWorkflowPlugin,\r\nthe previous attempt being #40153. However, there were some concerns \r\nraised in #40708 and hence it was reverted in #40714. This newer PR \r\nattempts to address those concerns.\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

found some serious problems with PR #40153 - actually I would rather recommend to revert this. It is really bad code added.\r\n\r\nFirst I was wondering about the new menu item. Actually wanted to optimize this and make the new Databricks Plugin to the \"Admin\" menu as a new top level menu entry is not really the right place.\r\n\r\nBut after changing a single line I was horrified about the plugin code and quality. It is just broken by default. If you click on the menu, you get an error page. Because the URL expects parameters and fails w/o.\r\nSo either there should not be a menu entry be added and plus parameters need to be checked.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the most critical problems:\r\n- Moving the plugin into \"Admin\" menu to be less prominent - whereas questioning a menu entry in general. It is use-less\r\n- Fixed handling if required parameters are missing\r\n- Fixing failure if run_id is not passed, replace will fail\r\n- Fixing redirect if no dag_id in parameters\r\n\r\nBut more and really serious is that the new plugin menu adds a Flask endpoint w/o any authentication! You can call the new URL anonymously(!) and pass and parameters that is affectting tasks, clears backends. Security nightmare,\r\nI am not sure what the right access level must be (and asusme there was no concept about this... who is authorized to clear databricks tasks? new role needed? admin? owner of
