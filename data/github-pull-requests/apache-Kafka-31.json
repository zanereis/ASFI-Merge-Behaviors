issue is related to an optimization for offset fetch logic.\r\n\r\nWhen a user calls `Consumer.poll()`, among other things, the consumer performs a network request to fetch any previously-committed offsets so it can determine from where to start fetching new records. When the user passes in a timeout of zero, it's almost always the case that the offset fetch network request will not be performed within 0 milliseconds. However, the consumer still sends out the request and handles the response when it is received, usually a few milliseconds later. In this first attempt, the lookup fails and the `poll()` loops back around. Given that this timeout is the common case, the consumer caches the offset fetch response/result from the first attempt (even though it timed out) because it knows that the next call to `poll()` is going to attempt the exact same operation. When it is later attempted a second time, the response is already there from the first attempt such that the consumer doesn't need to perform a network request.\r\n\r\nThe existing consumer has implemented this caching in [PendingCommittedOffsetRequest](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/internals/ConsumerCoordinator.java#L132). The new consumer has implemented it in [CommitRequestManager](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/internals/CommitRequestManager.java#L510). The core issue is the new consumer implementation is clearing out the first attempt's cached result too aggressively. The effect being that the second (and subsequent) attempts fail to find any previous attempt's cached result, and all submit network requests, which all fail. Thus the consumer never makes any headway.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

introduced in-memory caching of FetchSessions. Brokers with a large number of Fetch requests suffer from contention on trying to acquire a lock on FetchSessionCache.\r\n\r\nThis change aims to reduce lock contention for FetchSessionCache by sharding the cache into multiple segments, each responsible for an equal range of sessionIds. Assuming Fetch requests have a uniform distribution of sessionIds, the probability of contention on a segment is reduced by a factor of the number of segments.\r\n\r\nWe ensure backwards compatibility by ensuring total number of cache entries remain the same as configured and sessionIds are randomly allocated.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

Context\r\nControllerRegistrationManagerTest is flaky due to the poll in L221. The potential root cause is a race condition between the first poll (L221) and the second poll (L229). Before the second poll, we mock a response (L226), which should be processed by the second poll. However, if the first poll take this away, the second poll would get nothing, and this could lead to an error. \r\nJira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15897\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nRemove the first poll since it is not necessary. We can check the manager status with `rpcStats` without polling.\r\n\r\n## Test\r\ntest with `./gradlew clean core:test --tests ControllerRegistrationManagerTest` and passed\r\n\r\n### Committer

Test Plan\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n1. Create a topic with 1 partition and 2 RF\r\n2. Send some messages to the topic, wait for the segments to roll over, and upload them to remote storage.\r\n3. Ensure that the log-start-offset < local-log-start-offset\r\n4. Stop all the nodes where the replica is placed.\r\n5. Delete the replication-offset-checkpoint, recovery-point-offset-checkpoint, and kafka_cleanshutdown files on one node that is about to be started first.\r\n6. Start the remaining nodes\r\n7. The high-watermark will be set to log-start-offset and the leader will throw OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE errors for the follower fetch-requests and cannot accept the produce requests.\r\n\r\nCommands:\r\n\r\n```\r\n sh kafka-topics.sh --create --topic tieredTopic --partitions 1 --replication-factor 2 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \\\r\n    --config

for one option to fix the issue described in KAFKA-16514\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a hacky approach to introduce a backdoor solely for Kafka Streams to implement its special close semantics. But to be fair, that is exactly the same thing that happens right now, except that instead of a backdoor internal method we have a backdoor internal ConsumerConfig (ie \"leave.group.on.close\"). This just adds a way to modify that config so Kafka Streams operators can decide at close time whether they want to leave the group or not.\r\n\r\nFor example, a Streams application may want to scale in by permanently stopping some nodes, in which case the consumers should all immediately leave the group. However it may also want to simply bounce the node, in which case it makes sense to not leave the group when closed.

a case where we could generate useless PartitionChangeRecords on metadata versions older than 3.6-IV0. This could happen in the case where we had an ISR with only one broker in it, and we were trying to go down to a fully empty ISR. In this case, PartitionChangeBuilder would block the record to going down to a fully empty ISR (since that is not valid in these pre-KIP-966 metadata versions), but it would still emit the record, even though it had no effect.","created_at":"2024-04-25T21:09:00Z","updated_at":"2024-05-02T16:23:30Z","closed_at":"2024-05-02T16:23:26Z","merged_at":"2024-05-02T16:23:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"a3f24149905886ac719901eeab8dc6d7b3c79614","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":970614471,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzA2MTQ0NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/controller","name":"controller","color":"1602d1","default":false,"description":"Kafka

`KafkaAsyncConsumer` would occasionally fail to stop when `wakeup()` was invoked.

If the operation's `Future` is *already* completed by thread A when thread B invoke's `completeExceptionally()` inside `wakeup()`, the `WakeupException` will be ignored. We should use the return value from `completeExceptionally()` to determine if that call actually triggered completion of the `Future`. If that method returns `false`, that signals that the `Future` was already completed, and the exception we passed to `completeExceptionally()` was ignored.

Move all Kraft configs/docs/defaults into `KRaftConfigs`. \r\n- Note: We have already `RaftConfig` but it seems to contain limited amount of configs that only configure `controller` raft and shouldn't include configs shared by both broker/controller in KRAFT mode or only for broker in KRAFT mode.  \r\n    - `RaftConfig.QUORUM_VOTERS_CONFIG` is the only exception to this rule and I am not sure if it should be defined in `KRaftConfigs` and shared by `RaftConfig` or if it should be `RaftConfig`. Originally this config had an alias in KafkaConfig but most places where it referred to `KafkaConfig.QuorumVotersProp` has access to `RaftConfig.QUORUM_VOTERS_CONFIG`. \r\n    - I choice to use  `RaftConfig.QUORUM_VOTERS_CONFIG` everywhere as the prefix for defining this config is defined in `RaftConfig` if people prefer that we move this to `KRaftConfigs` (this might be tricky and we may need to move `KRaftConfigs` int `server-common` instead) or revert this [commit](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/15775/commits/6974959a1baf8e61cff372de2b2ba90774ebc34d) and keep the original

Part 1 introduced verification of transactions with the transaction coordinator on the `Produce` and `TxnOffsetCommit` paths. This introduced the possibility of new errors when responding to those requests. For backwards compatibility with older clients, a choice was made to convert some of the new retriable errors to existing errors that are expected and retried correctly by older clients.\r\n\r\n`NETWORK_EXCEPTION` was forgotten about and not converted, but can occur if, for example, the transaction coordinator is temporarily refusing connections. Now, we convert it to:\r\n * `NOT_ENOUGH_REPLICAS` on the `Produce` path, just like the other retriable errors that can arise from transaction verification.\r\n * `COORDINATOR_LOAD_IN_PROGRESS` on the `TxnOffsetCommit` path. This error does not force coordinator lookup on clients, unlike `COORDINATOR_NOT_AVAILABLE`. Note that this deviates from KIP-890, which says that retriable errors should be converted to `COORDINATOR_NOT_AVAILABLE`.\r\n\r\n Conflicts:\r\n\tcore/src/main/scala/kafka/server/ReplicaManager.scala\r\n\tgroup-coordinator/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/coordinator/group/GroupCoordinatorService.java\r\n\tgroup-coordinator/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/coordinator/group/GroupCoordinatorServiceTest.java\r\n\r\nThere were some conflicts in the how the code path changed. We have three paths. \r\n1. Produce -- In appendEntries we have the callback just for produce requests. I've included the error and the comment there.  \r\n2.
