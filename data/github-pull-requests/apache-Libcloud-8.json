storage: Fix hash computation performance on upload\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe storage base driver computes the hash of uploaded files: individual drivers use it to ensure the reported hash is correct. Before libcloud 2.x, this was done efficiently: the file was only read once, and we were using `hash.update()` to avoid keeping the whole file in memory. With the switch to the requests module, both of these optimizations were removed inadvertently. It turns out the important one is using `hash.update()`: computing the hash on the whole file in memory is orders of magnitude slower.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n###

Fix improper getresponse() uses\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDuring the migration from httplib to requests, a lot of driver code did not change because they use the high-level libcloud API which hid the change from httplib to requests with the HttpLibResponseProxy adapter. However, in some cases, driver code needs to access the actual response, and does this by calling getresponse().\r\n\r\nWhile this used to return an httlib.HTTPResponse instance, this now returns a requests.Response instance. All code covered by tests was fixed, but OVH and Brightbox common code is not fully covered. I don't have a subscription to either service and can't test the change, but the resulting code can only be more correct since it fixes the `getresponse() result comes from httplib` assumption.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code

Ensure RawResponse downloads don't consume RAM\r\n\r\nThe fix is general but the cause is very specific: since libcloud 2.0, `download_object()` in the S3 and GCS drivers first places the item in RAM, then writes it to a file. The main reason it broke is that accessing `body` in a requests Response consumes it entirely and loads it in RAM. To fix this, I moved `body` to a property: it is still accessibly, but loaded only if requested.\r\n\r\nTested this change by downloading a 38M file using this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom libcloud.storage.drivers.google_storage import GoogleStorageDriver\r\n\r\ndriver = GoogleStorageDriver(key=..., secret=...)\r\nobj = driver.get_object('container_name', 'object_name')\r\ndriver.download_object(obj, '/path/to/file')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe RAM usage

Description\r\n\r\nWhen calling destroy_node() on Azure ARM, several cloud calls happen. After successfully destroying the VM, the method tries to remove all NICs related to that VM. If one of these attempts fail, the VHD's life is spared.\r\nThe updates on this PR make destroy_node() continue with its task after a NIC cleanup fail, trying to remove the remaining NICs and the assigned VHD.\r\nAlso added tests for destroy_node(), modified the test suite a little to be able to simulate different HTTP response sequences.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for

pull request proposes to replace coveralls coverage reports with codecov.io coverage reports.\r\n\r\nMy main reasons for the proposed change of service are:\r\n\r\n* codecov.io has a much nicer and better UI.\r\n* Right now we have coverage comments enabled which means coveralls posts a comment on the pull request on every push. Imo, this adds a lot of noise, but very little value. It discourages people to push often (which is a good practice) and adds noise to the pull request which makes actual valuable review feedback harder to see / find.\r\n\r\nCodecov.io can be configured to add only a single comment which is then updated when code and coverage changes. Imo, that's much better than comment spam on every push.","created_at":"2017-09-10T20:42:23Z","updated_at":"2017-09-11T07:48:57Z","closed_at":"2017-09-11T07:48:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fca1429878fb0c22dedbc955345f04e253281879","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1109/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1109/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1109/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/67d6f912502e978536711334c04a388117037948","head":{"label":"Kami:codecov_experiment","ref":"codecov_experiment","sha":"67d6f912502e978536711334c04a388117037948","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.

know that the PR description said \"temporarily\", but such things are rarely temporary so we need to be careful when merging such things. Strict checking was enabled for a reason and disabling such automatic checks is rarely a good idea - root cause should be found and fixed instead.\r\n\r\n/cc @tonybaloney ","created_at":"2017-09-06T15:08:00Z","updated_at":"2017-09-10T19:52:08Z","closed_at":"2017-09-10T19:52:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f8c650db6e84044a7f3f30058a1acdca0f677077","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1105/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1105/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1105/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/2045c5b6854c785b6c907c3a797322906a67044d","head":{"label":"Kami:re_enable_sphinx_docs_strict_checks","ref":"re_enable_sphinx_docs_strict_checks","sha":"2045c5b6854c785b6c907c3a797322906a67044d","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.

[LIBCLOUD-930] Take advantage of AWS EC2 tag-on-create feature\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis small patch changes the way EC2 compute nodes are tagged when created, by adding the tags on the

This avoids eventual consistency issues that sometimes happen when an instance isn't created yet so it can't be tagged.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the AWS docs are here:

Changes Title (Update: LIBCLOUD-926 - [BUG Azure_ARM] in ex_create_public_ip function among other)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis suggested update fixes the condition that checks for parameter \"location\" being None. If the parameter is not None, the original code would still exit and raise ValueError exception.\r\n\r\nIn the file libcloud/compute/drivers/azure_arm.py.\r\nThere are some functions as ex_create_public_ip function that it needs a location parameter, when this parameter is send, a error happen: \"Location is required\".\r\nLooking at the code I found with the following:\r\n\r\n       if location is None and self.default_location:\r\n            location = self.default_location\r\n        else:\r\n            raise ValueError(\"location is required.\")\r\nThis does not evaluate a possible parameter, only if the value is None.\r\n\r\nI suggested the following change:\r\n\r\n        if location is None:\r\n            if self.default_location:\r\n                location = self.default_location\r\n            else:\r\n                raise ValueError(\"location is required.\")\r\nThe affected methods are:\r\n\r\n   ex_create_network_security_group\r\n   ex_delete_network_security_group\r\n   ex_create_public_ip\r\nThe same code has been used in several other places.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\ndone, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [ ] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n- [ ]

Fix Linode DNS records to have 'priority' in extra field\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nLinode DNS Record does not expose 'priority' value on its `extra` field, which is used in `DNSDriver._get_bind_record_line()`. It's required for MX/SRV records to be exported with `DNSDriver.export_to_bind_format()`.\r\n\r\nLinode DNS resources already have 'PRIORITY' field (see https://www.linode.com/api/dns/domain.resource.list and https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/trunk/libcloud/test/dns/fixtures/linode/resource_list.json), we can just copy it into the `extra` field.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code

Description\r\n\r\nThis fixes more issues flagged by lgtm.com code queries. Most were minor/style but a few were errors meaning the code did not have the intended effected (e.g. ```if x == a or b``` instead of ```if (x == a) or (x == b)```\r\n\r\nThe standard lgtm deep code analysis highlights dependencies, vulnerabilities ([3 found](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/apache/libcloud/vulnerabilities)) and currently flag [155 alerts](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/apache/libcloud/alerts/) - but you can investigate further by writing [your own custom queries](https://lgtm.com/docs/ql/about-ql) to explore your code base.\r\n\r\nI personally find lgtm alerts most useful when using [PR integration](https://lgtm.com/docs/lgtm/config/pr-integration) as it allows to check and deal with potential issues before they find their way into master - for instance I haven't looked into it yet but it seems that [2a450e4](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/apache/libcloud/rev/2a450e4072c0468440877ec3decf3b21eaf369fa) may have

Please use bytes input or XML fragments without declaration.` which was completely obstructed by reraise of `MalformedResponseError`.\r\n\r\nThis was already partially fixed in

debugging explanation here:\r\n[docker_tls.txt](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/files/1047835/docker_tls.txt)\r\n\r\n* With this pr I propose to add a new class DockertlsConnection in DockerContainerDriver, which\r\n   handles the tls connection and is a subclass of class KeyCertificateConnection (added in \r\n   libcloud/common/base.py). \r\n \r\n* I replaced key,secret default values with empty strings( previous None)\r\n  otherwise it's not possible to call \r\n  driver(host='https://198.61.239.128', port=4243, key_file='key.pem', cert_file='cert.pem')\r\n\r\n* I added ca_cert variable in DockerContainerDriver, in case of a user doesn't want to change\r\n  the environment's variables through libcloud.security.CA_CERTS_PATH\r\n  commit d5af021a92ef04ff42439f0e5ff7bd007de05015\r\n  commit e15e4a8346a121eb437c45b9f9c3c8812afd5ce5\r\n\r\n* I passed the real version and not a default one\r\n\r\nI have done seperated commits if you want to exclude anything.\r\n\r\nI tested this pr against all scenarios:\r\n- http \r\n- http basic authentication \r\n- tls\r\n- tls key_file & cert_file\r\n- tls verified key_file, cert_file, ca_cert\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [X] [Code

Handle Vultr API rate-limit\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nVultr API imposes a rate limit of 2 requests/sec (actually they provide some leeway, but let's stick with the official documentation). A typical workflow for a libcloud's client that wants to launch a Vultr node could involve something like the following:\r\n\r\n1. driver.list_locations()\r\n2. driver.list_sizes()\r\n3. driver.list_images()\r\n4. driver.list_key_pairs()\r\n5. driver.create_key_pair(name, key)\r\n6. driver.create_node(...)\r\n\r\nA client could easily exceed the rate limit in certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes Vultr compute driver handle rate-limiting in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. Minimize the likelihood of being rate-limited by not authenticating requests that don't require an api key. Such requests aren't rate-limited.\r\n2. If hit by the rate limit, retry the request. A `rate_limited` decorator is in charge of automatically retrying the request after a sleep period when a 503 Service Unavailable response is received.\r\n\r\nIn order to implement (1), this PR first updates the way the driver authenticates with Vultr. Now it uses an HTTP header (as described in current api docs: https://www.vultr.com/api/) instead of a query parameter.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick

Fix list_sizes() for new regions in EC2 compute driver\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCalls to driver.list_sizes() were broken for new EC2 regions, namely 'eu-west-2', 'ca-central-1' and 'cn-north-1'. There were two different problems:\r\n- The api name employed to scrape prices was incorrect in the case of 'eu-west-2' and 'ca-central-1'.\r\n- Pricing for the Beijing region doesn't seem to be available at the moment.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes these issues in the following way and closes #1045:\r\n1. Fix api names in `scrape-ec2-prices.py`\r\n2.

If the parameter is not None, the original code would still exit and raise ValueError exception.\r\n\r\nIn the file libcloud/compute/drivers/azure_arm.py.\r\nThere are some functions as ex_create_public_ip function that it needs a location parameter, when this parameter is send, a error happen: \"Location is required\".\r\nLooking at the code I found with the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n       if location is None and self.default_location:\r\n            location = self.default_location\r\n        else:\r\n            raise ValueError(\"location is required.\")\r\n```\r\nThis does not evaluate a possible parameter, only if the value is None.\r\n\r\nI suggested the following change:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        if location is None:\r\n            if self.default_location:\r\n                location = self.default_location\r\n            else:\r\n                raise ValueError(\"location is required.\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe affected methods are:\r\n```\r\n   ex_create_network_security_group\r\n   ex_delete_network_security_group\r\n   ex_create_public_ip\r\n```\r\nThe same code has been used in several other places.\r\n\r\n###

error:\r\n```\r\n/home/johnny/Documents/mylibcloud/libcloudfine/fork_libcloud/libcloud/libcloud/common/base.pyc in __init__(self, response, connection)\r\n    159         if not self.success():\r\n

\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/918/commits/2f9c3a3aa1b6654ede67a2a6e63dd3e59437c6de\r\n\r\nI extended the previous check with ``` 'fromImage' in self.request.url```, so to restrict that check which\r\nrefers to install_image and only. Because ```self.headers.get('transfer-encoding') == 'chunked'```  is valid in other cases too. This way everything seems to work fine!\r\n\r\n### done\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code
