SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR does two things, firstly it adds support for private gsheets as a dynamic form in the DatabaseConnection modal. Secondly, it refactors how we pass encrypted fields in said modal. \r\n\r\nPreviously this sections were very narrow. What this PR does is, during the onSave action after all parameters have been validated, goes through the dbModel or a new calculated column named parameters_schema and checks to see if each parameter is encrypted. It uses the 'x-encrypted-extra' field that is exposed through the /available endpoint. \r\n\r\nOne point of confusion that might arise from reading the code, we pass in encrypted fields as strings in the frontend, but then convert them to dictionaries in the backend, thus when fetching encrypted fields, the fields have to be serialized in order to be properly saved. \r\n\r\nCurrently the only other database that uses encrypted fields is Big Query, the previous logic used on creation and edit have been preserved and are applied to gsheets. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nadding a private sheet:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48933336/134589795-3fdc384d-9a97-47e6-9aa5-a88a08172f49.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadding a private sheet to a existing database that has only public sheets:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48933336/134589512-9446d172-0991-4370-b5e2-4db0946fd238.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nI am able to create any database that is able to be added dynamically. I tested this on Gsheets, BigQuery, and Postgres (using a very basic localhost postgres). \r\n\r\nI was able to add a private gsheet. Am able to go back and edit it, and still be able to connect and finish.\r\n\r\nCreate a database that only has public gsheets. \r\n\r\nCreate a database that only has public gsheets, and then when editing it add a private gsheet with a proper encrypted json. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nProgress on the Reports refactor in the ReportModal. When Arash and I last left off, in an effort to find where the extra GET was happening, we looked into redux and followed [dashboardState](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/actions/dashboardState.js) into the [DashboardBuilder](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/components/DashboardBuilder/DashboardBuilder.tsx) component and began searching around the redux state/actions in [DashboardHeader.jsx](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/containers/DashboardHeader.jsx) when we ran out of time.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nGo to the following file and observe the cleaner code:\r\n- `superset-frontend/src/components/ReportModal/HeaderReportActionsDropdown/index.tsx`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAdd the possibility to override `is_feature_enabled` instead of `get_feature_flags`, the later when using a feature flag management system, would force all feature flags to be evaluated when evaluating a single feature.\r\n\r\nIS_FEATURE_ENABLED_FUNC and GET_FEATURE_FLAGS_FUNC should be mutually exclusive (but not obligatory) has stated on the config comments, this is because `get_feature_flags` will call `is_feature_enabled` to make the API consistent and safe to get all feature flags and be sure that all gets applied on the override.\r\n\r\nIntroduces a new Config

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCurrently the temporal wrapper class used by the sqla model returns `Type[TypeEngine]`, although it should be returning an instantiated `TypeEngine`, which results in an incorrect string representation of the type object. This doesn't affect regular query generation (the types and instances can mostly be used interchangeably when writing SqlAlchemy code), but causes trouble in the Presto db engine spec here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/3fe2e6ec731529ae228904b9b5e39baec073ae8d/superset/db_engine_specs/presto.py#L385-L407\r\n\r\nand more specifically here (notice how the expected data type for `data_type` is `types.TypeEngine`, not `Type[types.TypeEngine]`):\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/3fe2e6ec731529ae228904b9b5e39baec073ae8d/superset/db_engine_specs/presto.py#L293-L303\r\n\r\nWithout this fix the new test fails with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>       assert str(new_type) == str(orig_type)\r\nE       assert \"<class 'supe...WrapperType'>\" == 'DATETIME'\r\nE         - DATETIME\r\nE         + <class 'superset.models.sql_types.base.literal_dttm_type_factory.<locals>.TemporalWrapperType'>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWindows users encounter problems running the `docker-compose` commands\r\n to run an instance of Superset.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is line-endings for the `*.sh` files that are\r\n mounted and used in the `command` sections for the superset images.\r\n\r\nMany Windows users will check the repository out with line endings set\r\n to `CRLF`. When mounted in to the *nix-based containers, these line\r\n endings are not understood, leading to errors such as:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n/usr/bin/env: bash\\r: No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe addition of a `.gitattributes` file resolves this issue by telling\r\n git to always resolve these files with `LF` line endings.\r\n\r\nfixes #10132\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ]

However, '<insert how UUIDs are generated>', the same db connection (same URI) might not have the same UUID on the export instance, and on the import one.

SUMMARY\r\nThis is my PR for issue Extra features for Range Filters #16582\r\n\r\nRange filters are fantastic, but there is no simple way to adjust the step size or the scale of the range. Scale is useful for large ranges, eg a log scale, so that you can easily select small and large values\r\n\r\n- Step Size is just an additional Advanced Config dropdown box with several pre-populated choices, as well as a free form option. The tricky part was getting it to properly work in the Native Filter Config modal, since they're expecting all parameters to be checkboxes.\r\n- Scale is a little trickier, but it could possibly be set up as multiple options (eg log, power, etc). Currently I implemented a log scale option, which would make zeros hard. I'm currently ignoring that :)\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nConfig Screen Usage\r\n![config screen use](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70416691/132033938-6d095135-698b-448c-aeb7-2ec359388038.gif)\r\n\r\nLog Scale with 0.01 step size\r\n![log-scale and 0 01 step](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70416691/132033942-06eda7eb-1f09-49c9-a3bf-847de4848a5e.gif)\r\n\r\nLinear Scale with 100k step size\r\n![linear-scale and 100k step](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70416691/132033945-2b592134-3614-4ac4-84eb-d6eb497e9e36.gif)\r\n\r\nConfig Screen Defaults\r\n![config screen defaults](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70416691/132033950-9f026b6b-b364-465a-81c1-c224869b4c65.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nGenerally top-level Pylint disable should be discouraged (except for a few necessary exceptions related to imports and number of lines) as they can mask a number of issues. This PR moves top-level Pylint disable messages to the relevant scope (and fixes a number of issues which surfaced by doing so).\r\n\r\nNote the bulk of the changes are in `superset/viz.py` which I gather could be slated for deprecation.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

SUMMARY\r\nDue to incorrect passing of props and setting state of FiltersBadge, we were rerendering the component multiple times. It's very expensive, as FiltersBadge calls `selectIndicatorsForChart` and `selectNativeIndicatorsForChart` functions, which traverse dashboard layout tree. Rerendering filters badge for every chart resulted in thousands of unnecessary traverses of dashboard layout tree, causing the performance to take a hit. This PR introduces caching and memoization for FiltersBadge, which reduces the amount of redundant rerenders.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nI measured the number of rerenders of FiltersBadge with whyDidYouRender library (https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render). It reports every rerender of a component that wasn't necessary and could've been avoided (e.g. by memoizing props or using PureComponent).\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/131681210-7fd4ff10-fd9d-49c3-b467-2448eb99f7c8.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/131681806-7f1da2f8-5ae5-416b-a3c3-6879ce4e4f7f.mov\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nDue to incorrect passing props to `DragDroppable` (i.e. passing inline functions and objects instead of memoizing them first), the component was being rerendered multiple times (1609 in the case of initial render of Sales Dashboard from sample data).\r\nThis PR improves that behaviour.\r\nThere's still a lot of room for improvement - in some cases it was problematic to memoize some functions without converting DragDroppable's parent from class to functional component. For that reason, there are still quite a lot of rerenders, especially in edit mode.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nI measured the number of rerenders of `DragDroppable` with `whyDidYouRender` library (https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render). It reports every rerender of a component that wasn't necessary and could've been avoided (e.g. by memoizing props or using PureComponent).\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/131513340-9b1d96fc-052b-4f80-a7ca-44d116074c71.mov\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/131513453-44973062-5a48-4ef9-ad43-a1ee9ad8a96a.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n###

Enhancements\r\n\r\nThis PR implements `Extra Control` on the area chart V2, and the chart's update mechanism is using `setControlValue` hook. There are some differences or improvements:\r\n- In explore the stack control will be updated if `Extra Control` is updated. But for NVD3, updating extra control does not update the stack control. \r\n- Here only keep  `Stack` and `Expend` two options (Stream Graph will come soon) and add a new `None` option, which can cancel the stack style.\r\n- Another UI difference is the extra control button which uses the same radio control as the control panel instead of NVD3 radio button.\r\n\r\n## explore\r\n\r\n### before\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/167296244-ea5d6bd5-f7b6-4abc-a058-d9fd9e894242.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### after\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/167295413-aa4379a8-8442-4342-90d6-fff81a638a4a.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## dashboard\r\n\r\n### before\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/167296261-d5450c9f-c00d-421c-ad7a-f29368e266cd.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### after\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/167296426-05a99519-fcf6-43df-8639-ec4692ea6442.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nSee #15109, SQL Lab show \"Refetch Results\" button while fetching large query results. The fix in #15109 works, but it introduce another issue so we had to revert it. This PR adds extra fix on top of it.\r\n\r\nSee the 2nd commit: in airbnb most users still using client side localStorage to store query history. it seems sometimes the queries data was broken or messed up (for example, after user clear localStorage or delete some queries from History Tab). When user tries to re-run a query and sql lab start polling, sql lab can not find query id in the Redux state, which will cause exception, and show offline status. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nIf `filter.controlValues` is `undefined` (the case of metadata from when native filters wasn't yet stable), the Filter Tab will crash. This ensures that the component doesn't crash if `controlValues` isn't defined. This was the only case of `controlValues` that I was able to find where we didn't check for `?`.\r\n\r\nCloses #16438\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a native value filter in version 1.1.0.\r\n2. Upgrade to 1.3.0.\r\n3. watch the Filter Tab crash when in Dashboard mode.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if

SUMMARY\r\nWhile working on an unrelated PR, I started getting weird linting errors from `pylint` that flip-flopped between\r\n\r\n```\r\npylint run-test: commands[0] | pylint superset\r\n************* Module superset.models.slice\r\nsuperset/models/slice.py:56:0: R0902: Too many instance attributes (10/8) (too-many-instance-attributes)\r\n************* Module superset.models.dashboard\r\nsuperset/models/dashboard.py:132:0: R0902: Too many instance attributes (9/8) (too-many-instance-attributes)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand later when those were disabled\r\n\r\n```\r\npylint run-test: commands[0] | pylint superset\r\n************* Module superset.models.slice\r\nsuperset/models/slice.py:56:0: I0021: Useless suppression of

'too-many-instance-attributes' (useless-suppression)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI figured this might have been fixed in the most recent 2.10.2 release of `pylint`, but sadly that wasn't the case (same flip-flop). However, since I already did the necessary corrections for 2.10, I figure we might just as well bump anyway.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently removing all owners from the datasets modal raises the following error:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130931659-a9ce9094-1d78-465c-a33e-43d582d16e95.png)\r\n\r\nThis makes the following changes to the endpoint:\r\n- When `OLD_API_CHECK_DATASET_OWNERSHIP` config is set to the default value (`True`), we both check ownership and make sure the user doesn't lock themselves out of the object. See #15149 for more details on how this works for Admin vs regular users\r\n- When the `OLD_API_CHECK_DATASET_OWNERSHIP` config flag is set to `False`, the behavior is unchanged (other than fixing the error when `datasource_dict[\"owners\"] == None`). Note that in this scenario, a user is able to both edit datasets that they don't own and also save without adding themselves to the list of owners. See #16461 for context on this FF.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130931505-fdba81db-f0ca-403b-8d9b-44aade90ff1c.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Login as Admin\r\n2. Open the dataset modal for a dataset you own\r\n3. Remove yourself as owner\r\n4. See the error\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nDuring migration of the Value filter to the new Select component, support for non-string based filter values (`number`, `boolean` and `null`) stopped working correctly. This fixes that\r\n\r\nKnown limitations: Even with this fix `null` values won't be supported in single select mode. This is due to how the native filter framework interprets the special case of a filter value being unset when the value is `null` (in the \"multiple select\" mode the filter value is `[null]` which is interpreted as being set). We have a potential fix for this, but it will require a slightly bigger refactor to be fully supported.\r\n\r\nTODO: update type declarations on `superset-ui` to get rid of the `@ts-ignore`s.\r\n\r\nDashboard with filters unset:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130928197-f49cb965-759d-41ad-8029-80ceb28edf33.png)\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130927234-d7d6ef39-58c9-4c0b-b1a9-2a38faf31160.png)\r\nThe query is now correctly issuing an `IS NULL` where clause:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130927964-ec05d849-c0ff-499c-9c1d-517f000e92e9.png)\r\n\r\nNow the values are also formatted correctly\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130927337-836054e3-4a80-4d7e-a073-a5a40dc9869a.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nNotice how `null` is interpreted as `false`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130927537-00f3d132-ae16-40c0-85b1-0efc5242a9aa.png)\r\nSame in the query:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130927612-3ef04039-56e9-499b-92e8-3486577b46f1.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nMore explicitly handle `Infinity` values in query results and improve type inference related to infinity values.\r\n\r\nPreviously we treat `Infinity` as `N/A` since JSON cannot handle infinity values. This PR explicitly retains infinity values in Pandas dataframes and adds two fields in data response (`infs` and `-infs`) to return to the client side which `null`s in the data records are actually infinities. The client side can then convert them back into JavaScript `Infinity/-Infinity` (not the scope of this PR).\r\n\r\nMore unit tests to come.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWe generate formData, which is passed through props to Chart, with a function `getFormDataWithExtraFilters`. The idea is to generate formData, save it in a cache object, and on each subsequent render use the cached version. However, due to incorrect equality checks, we never used the cached version and created a new formData object each time. That resulted not only in recalculating the same logic many times, but also triggered Chart's rerender, as formData object's reference was changing.\r\nMoreover, in Chart component's `shouldComponentUpdate` function we triggered rerender each time chart's visibility changed - in other words, we rerendered all charts every time we changed a tab.\r\nThis PR fixes both of those behaviours.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo changes\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nEverything should work as it did before.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the Explore view does not update the \"can_overwrite\" permission when the user updates the chart ownership, as it's populated from bootstrap data (rendered server-side when page is loaded). In addition, the \"Save\" button in the chart metadata modal is enabled when the owners array is initially empty, but after adding and removing a user the save button gets disabled.\r\n\r\nThis removes the `can_overwrite` property from the Explore bootstrap data and replaces it with state from Redux, making it possible to change the disabled state of the \"Save (Overwrite)\" button in the Save modal. In addition, the `slice.owners` property in bootstrap data is changed to provide numeric ids instead of \"firstname lastname\" (most other models were already returning owners in this format; it appears the \"firstname lastname\" results weren't being used anywhere in Explore). Also update some types and remove redundant `user_id` property from bootstrap data.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130752708-1ed4a830-f2d6-487d-a3d4-10a1fe283539.mp4\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130752813-aeaa593c-94e2-48a8-9705-397048386cc2.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Login as Admin\r\n2. Open the Charts page and edit the metadata of an example dataset that doesn't have any owners\r\n3. Add and remove yourself as owner and notice how the Save button goes from being enabled to disabled without the owners changing. Click cancel.\r\n4. Open an example chart in Explore that doesn't have any owners\r\n5. Add yourself as an owner\r\n6. Try to overwrite the chart - notice that the \"Save (Overwrite)\" radio button is disabled\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

SUMMARY\r\nIn DashboardComponent (a parent component of dashboard components such as ChartHolder, Tabs, Column etc.) we had a large mapStateToProps function, which maps redux state to props. A lot of those props were used only in some components, but since they were passed to every component, each change triggered a rerender of all components instead of the ones that actually use the changed prop. This PR decouples those props from components that don't need them.\r\nFor example - `directPathToChild` is used only by `ChartHolder` and `Tabs`, but any change of that prop triggered a rerender of all components on dashboard.\r\nThis PR is the first of a series of PRs that will come soon - all related to reducing dashboard rerenders.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo changes\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nEvery dashboard functionality should work as it did before\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:
