task with an upstream mapped task doesn't wait for the mapped upstream task instances to complete before attempting to run. This results in inconsistent behaviour. For example, if you have an upstream task with 3 mapped task, once any of the task instances finishes, the downstream task will try to run and will depend on the state with which the first finished task in the upstream finished. If the state is failed, then the downstream will be upstream failed. Also, if the state is successful, then the downstream trigger rule will evaluate using this success state of one of the upstream tasks. If eventually, other tasks in the upstream are completed with other states other than success, those are not used in the downstream mapped evaluation.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I had to check if all the upstreams were done and only proceed to evaluate the trigger rule if the upstreams were done.

draft implementing #32650\r\n\r\nAdd the boolean parameter `use_glob` to `GCSObjectExistenceSensor`. \r\n\r\nWhen set to `True` the sensor will use the `hook.list` method leveraging the newly introduced `match_glob` parameter to check if files are present, making it possible to define a`GCSObjectExistenceSensor` that checks if files that satisfy the given glob are present in a certain bucket.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/34132\r\n\r\nWhen creating the feature request I was only thinking of the Graph tab. However, while playing with this I realized that whenever `tab` is set, the user will expect to see the details panel and the requested tab.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 main scenarios where a user would navigate to a link with the `tab` query param set:\r\n1. User clicks on one of the pills on the DAG view (Graph, Gantt, Code). Imo, the user will expect to see the relevant tab in the details panel, even if they have hid it previously.\r\n2. User clicks on a link (e.g. from DAG runs, or someone sharing a link). Less clear cut than scenario 1, but still I think the most user friendly result is to show the requested tab (in the details panel).\r\n\r\nThe behavior is so that we do not change the user's setting, if they go back to the grid view the details panel will be hidden if that was their original setting.\r\n\r\nI think there is still room for improvement, the UI feels slightly inconsistent due to the different methods of achieving the same state. This PR is just a tiny change to (hopefully) make this a bit less confusing to the user.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Unfortunately there is currently no way for the schedulers to know if the QUEUED DagRun is its original scheduled run, or has been cleared from an already finished state.\r\n\r\nThe inability for Airflow or for users to distinguish between the original scheduled DagRun, and a cleared DagRun leads to difficulty in inferring meaningful information from reliability metrics. Some example reliability metrics that can be used as meaningful indicators of the Airflow cluster health, when monitoring periodic / scheduled Dags include:\r\n\r\n[dagrun.schedule_delay](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/5dfbbbbf5adf70a9814121de8706a7c36f241836/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job_runner.py#L1341)\r\n[dagrun.first_task_scheduling_delay](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/4037d79b5c3fe952b491a24ed99dea95c43e7666/airflow/models/dagrun.py#L954)\r\n\r\nEach of these metrics help engineers understand if the Airflow is scheduling DagRuns and tasks when they are meant to be scheduled. And if these metrics are published in a reliable way, we empower engineers to be able to set up alarms when these metrics spike. Unfortunately, these metrics spike in false-alarms when the DagRuns are cleared.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes that we persist the information that a DagRun was **cleared** as a boolean attribute in the DagRun table, when the DagRun is cleared to a 'QUEUED' state from a finished state ('SUCCESS' or 'FAILED').\r\n\r\nAdditional positive impact of introducing this boolean attribute, is that this also exposes this information to users who may be using their own custom operators to generate reliability metrics of their DagRuns/tasks. (e.g. Deferrable Operators that measure SLAs as suggested in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-57+Refactor+SLA+Feature and other discussions).\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty

to https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/33632, which only tested the relevant code in isolation (my bad)\r\n\r\nWhile verifying this behaviour in order to test the new release, I noticed a few things - \r\n\r\n1) The `sync_perm --include-dags` CLI command was ignoring DAGs with empty (but not None) `access_control`\r\n2) Empty access_control blocks were being overwritten with `None` during DAG initialization.\r\n3) Loading a serialized DAG from the DB replaces `access_control={}` with `access_control=None`, which appears to be intentional behaviour originating from this function:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/30ddfc578fa01d616c93beba6523f5e026ce5c55/airflow/serialization/serialized_objects.py#L610-L630\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, is there a preferred way to explicitly enable the serialization/deserialization of empty dicts in the `_access_control` field? For now I've just overridden the method in the SerializedDAG class, but this feels a bit messy.\r\n\r\nAlso added a test to replicate this issue.","created_at":"2023-09-05T18:55:11Z","updated_at":"2023-10-03T11:33:00Z","closed_at":"2023-09-07T00:57:32Z","merged_at":"2023-09-07T00:57:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"a61b5e893af83d3022aa8265f230b52c5b2ad93d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jhtimmins","id":4926004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjYwMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4926004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins","html_url":"https://github.com/jhtimmins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/

documented in #33323, we have frequent failures of the flaky triggerer job tests.\r\n\r\nThe flaky failures are about some errors when we close all the sessions in teardown of the test. It turns out that the tests had side-effect - they have not waited for the TriggererJob thread to complete, they merely marked them to be stopped, but they have not waited for those to complete - this is quite plausible explanation of the flaky test failures - since those threads have 1 second sleep, it's more than likely that the session has been created and used by the thread while the teardown has been attempting to close all the sessions.\r\n\r\nThis side effect could also have an effect for other tests that were run after - because in a busy test run machine, the side effects could propagate further than just to the teardown, so it could also explain why sometimes (very rarely) other job tests failed with similar errors.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to join the runner after marking it to be stopped.\r\n\r\nFixes: #33323 (Hopefully)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Unfortunately, this leads to issues when the same label is used twice, which can happen as described in the linked issue. With this change we switch to use `_.id` instead, which must be unique (otherwise parsing the DAG would lead to `DuplicateTaskIdFound`).\r\n\r\nNew behavior (compare with issue's gif):\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn-std.droplr.net/files/acc_1153680/2NYRwT\" alt=\"image\" width=\"50%\">\r\n\r\nI extended the existing tests for the grid view to check for the new behavior. However, it doesn't look like we have any tests for the new graph view yet. I can give it a shot and create some basic tests (also covering the task group toggle).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

I also added some additional docstrings so those constants would not appear in documentation added in #34059.

As a part of that PR, `get_user_name` was set to be `FirstName LastName` for FAB.\r\n\r\nThis is a poor choice. A username should be both invariant and unique; FirstName and LastName are self-configurable by all user roles by default (aside from `Public`) in the Airflow UI, and for users who configure a dirsync SSO to FAB and do not give permission to Edit My Profile, the user's display name is commonly self-configurable in those systems as well. Further, any sufficiently large system will eventually encounter a name clash between two concurrent users, essentially leaving a username (identifier) clash. As a result, in today's version of the code:\r\n\r\n- In the places where `get_user_name` is implemented (for example the Audit Log), the Audit Log cannot be used to establish an event chain if a user decides to change their name (which they can do by default without the aid of an administrator)\r\n- If two users share a First Name and Last Name, the Audit Log likewise cannot be used to identify the responsible user\r\n- In the worst case scenario, a malicious user could affect the ability for a security team to identify a chain of events by disguising themselves as a legitimate user, or by rapidly changing their name in between actions (again, a permission that does not require administrator intervention)\r\n\r\nHowever, the user's display name is still an important and useful tool to provide a better UX. As a result, we fix this by performing the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. Add a new abstract method, `auth_manager.get_user_display_name` to augment the original API as proposed in AIP-56\r\n2. Change `get_user_name` to have fallback values available for backwards compatibility, but choose values that are sufficiently unique and invariant (email is not a perfect choice but it is better than display name)\r\n3. Implement `get_user_display_name` as the original `FirstName LastName` and migrate UI elements to use this new method instead of `get_user_name`.\r\n4. To fix the resultant regression of apache/airflow#30185, a new field `friendly_owner` is added to the `Log` table which stores the user's Display Name for easier human-based audits of actions. (NOTE: This may be something to split out into a separate PR, which can be bundled with a minor version update. This is included in a separate commit to aid in this.)\r\n\r\nThis has a few implications:\r\n\r\n1. Audit logs now read the user's username (or email, or DB ID) instead of the user's full name to provide proper accountability. The `owner` field is also single-valued, which makes for easier queries and cross-analysis with other log sources.\r\n2. Though I don't see any place immediately this would happen, it's not unlikely that `get_auth_manager.get_user_name` will make its way into actual security code eventually. If it does, this type of clash leads into a simple and very dangerous privilege escalation.\r\n3. User display name is properly segmented out in the base class so that future developers of their own auth extensions can show the proper UI elements for a user's display name (instead of showing everything as the user identifier).\r\n\r\nAdditional ref: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-56+Extensible+user+management\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the

unit tests are run on local virtual env on macOS, a lot of them fail because mocks do not work as expected when they are used in subprocesses. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods \"Changed in version 3.8: On macOS, the spawn start method is now the default (...)\". On Unix systems \"fork\" is the default (so development with breeze is not affected).\r\n\r\nWhen you mock a method with patch() in unittest.mock, this mock will be accessible in subprocess only if the start command was \"fork\" and not \"spawn\".\r\nI don't know how many tests were affected by it, for me, it was a couple of tests in test_scheduler_job.py.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/33949\r\n\r\nAdded filter to exclude manual runs from triggering calculate_dagrun_date_fields method which was causing extra scheduled runs.\r\n\r\nBefore this change, manual runs were triggering re-calculating next_dagrun_create_after which was supposed to be calculated only after an automated (SCHEDULED or BACKFILL) run is over in order to help scheduler schedule the next DAG run. There is no reason for manual runs to affect scheduled runs so they were excluded with an extra condition.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR migrates Job's methods to Internal API. \r\nIt also adds some methods for JobPydantic to make it usable interchangebly with Job.\r\nHowever not all method are migrated - *JobRunner still operates on ORM Job object - and it is required, as  Job contains some \"callback\" methods, which can't be easily serialized and executed in Internal API. Instead they may simply do additional Internal API call.\r\nJobPydantic is mostly used as a transport object.\r\n\r\ncloses: #29315\r\nrelated: #30298\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line

#33949\r\n\r\nAdded filter to exclude manual runs from triggering `calculate_dagrun_date_fields` method which was causing extra scheduled runs.\r\n\r\nBefore this change, manual runs were triggering re-calculating `next_dagrun_create_after` which was supposed to be calculated only after an automated (SCHEDULED or BACKFILL) run is over in order to help scheduler schedule the next DAG run. There is no reason for manual runs to affect scheduled runs so they were excluded with an extra condition.\r\n\r\nAlso renamed some variables used when invoking this method to make it explicit that dag runs for this logic must be automated dag runs only - clarifying naming should make it less likely for maintainers to accidentally misuse this method again.\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
