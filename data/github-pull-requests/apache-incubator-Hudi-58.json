What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIn order to drop any metadata partition (index), we can reuse the DELETE_PARTITION operation in metadata table. Subsequent to this, we can support drop index (with table config update) for async metadata indexer.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add a new API in `HoodieTableMetadataWriter`\r\n  - Current only supported for Spark metadata writer\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test in TestHoodieBackedMetadata, which creates multiple metadata partitions and then drops one. Asserted that there are no file slice from the dropped partition.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- During rollback, we have a validation that only latest commit should be rolledback. Or the commit being rollbacked should be the latest one. If there was a pending clustering instant, our validation was failing. So, fixed the case in this patch. \r\n- Also, during restore, at the end, cleaning up completed rollback got missed. Fixed the same here. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fixed Rollback validation to ignore pending clustering\r\n- Fixed restore to clean up completed rollback instant as well.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added tests to TestHoodieClientOnCopyOnWriteStorage.testRolblackOfRegularCommitWithPendingReplaceCommitInTimeline\r\n- Manually tested the restore w/ hudi-cli. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAdding spark continuous ingestion tool. Users can provide a source directory which can contain sub-directories w/ data. This tool will consume one directory at a time and ingest into hudi. It also checkpoints the last consumed directory and so, its safe to crash and restart the job at any point in time. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- Verified by running a job locally to consume data from source in a continuous manner. Tested w/ and w/o checkpointing. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWhen reattempting a pending rollback and the instant to rollback does not exist in the active timeline anymore due to a failure just before the rollback was transitioned from inflight to complete, such rollback cannot successfully be completed.   This PR fixes the logic so that in such case the rollback can be reattempted successfully.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Changes how the rollback is executed in different scenarios in `BaseHoodieWriteClient`.\r\n- Adds unit tests in `TestClientRollback`.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests in `TestClientRollback` and is verified as follows:\r\n- Run deltastreamer continuous mode writing MOR table.  Fail the deltastreamer and a rollback before markers are deleted or just before the rollback is transitioned from inflight to complete.  Rerun the deltastreamer.  Verified that the same rollback can finish successfully (which was failing to retry before this change), markers are deleted, and the rollback metadata is correct.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or

file-size to 16Mb, while on disk i'm getting ~80Mb files.\r\n\r\nThe reason for that is that we rely on `ParquetWriter` to control the file size (`canWrite` method), that relies in turn on FileSystem to trace how much was actually written to FS.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this approach is that `ParquetWriter` is writing lazily: It creates instances of `ParquetWriter` which in turn cache the whole record group when `write` methods are invoked and only flushes the data to FS only when closing the Writer (ie when `close`) is invoked.\r\n\r\nThis PR instead rebases `canWrite` to rely on `ParquetWriter::getDataSize` which holistically reflects the size of the records both already written to FS as well as the ones kept in memory.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-25T02:57:23Z","updated_at":"2022-05-18T20:10:53Z","closed_at":"2022-03-26T21:51:36Z","merged_at":"2022-03-26T21:51:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"189d5297b8826f5345fcb132dc7318fc4253c94e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/5129/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/5129/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5129/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/dd1c5ba905eb898ae3fe65b900bdafec751e4e9f","head":{"label":"onehouseinc:ak/prq-fsz-fix","ref":"ak/prq-fsz-fix","sha":"dd1c5ba905eb898ae3fe65b900bdafec751e4e9f","user":{"login":"onehouseinc","id":79297158,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc5Mjk3MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79297158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc","html_url":"https://github.com/onehouseinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":378248722,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzgyNDg3MjI=","name":"hudi","full_name":"onehouseinc/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"onehouseinc","id":79297158,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc5Mjk3MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79297158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc","html_url":"https://github.com/onehouseinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/onehouseinc/hudi","description":"Upserts,

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nBefore this change, the sequence of changes in the rollback action are:\r\n(1) Get the instant (C1) to roll back.  If there is already a pending rollback (RB_C1) for the same instant (C1) in the active timeline, the same rollback instant (RB_C1) and the rollback plan are reused.  Otherwise, schedule a new rollback instant.\r\n(2) Transition C1 to inflight if completed.\r\n(3) Delete data files written by C1.\r\n(4) Delete instant files (C1) in the data table timeline.\r\n(5) Commit changes from the rollback (RB_C1) to metadata table\r\n(6) Transition the rollback instant (RB_C1) from inflight to complete on data table timeline.\r\n\r\nBy design, we should only change data table timeline after committing the changes to the metadata table.  This PR changes the order of timeline changes as below, switching the order of (4) and (5) above:\r\n(1) Get the instant (C1) to roll back.  If there is already a pending rollback (RB_C1) for the same instant (C1) in the active timeline, the same rollback instant (RB_C1) and the rollback plan is reused.  Otherwise, schedule a new rollback instant.\r\n(2) Transition C1 to inflight if completed.\r\n(3) Delete data files written by C1.\r\n***(4) Commit changes from the rollback (RB_C1) to metadata table***\r\n***(5) Delete instant files (C1) in the data table timeline.***\r\n(6) Transition the rollback instant (RB_C1) from inflight to complete on data table timeline.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Changes the order of timeline change in `BaseRollbackActionExecutor`, by first applying the rollback metadata to the metadata table, then deleting the instant files of the instant to rollback in the data table timeline, and finally transiting the inflight rollback to complete in the data table timeline.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests around rollbacks.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

used for the clean action and MDT is not expected to roll back the same deltacommit before committing the changes again.  This PR fixes the problem by looking at all instants on the active timeline of the metadata table, not just the completed instants, before starting a commit in metadata table.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fixes the commit starting logic in `SparkHoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter` and `FlinkHoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter`\r\n- Add new unit and functional tests for the behavior\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change adds new tests in `TestCleaner` and `TestCleanPlanExecutor` for the failure scenario mentioned above.  Before the fix, the tests fail.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIf there were multi-reader for a specific metadata table file slice, it would meet a concurrent read issue:\r\n**The HFile native reader or LogRecordScanner could be closed by other readers by accident.**\r\n\r\nWhen closed base file reader by accident, it will cause NPE.\r\nWhen closed log scanner by accident, it will cause empty result.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixed this issue through followed change:\r\n1. When reuse is false, it means no need for sharing readers, so that we let each reader holds their own HFiIe reader and log scanner.\r\n2. When reuse is true, we create and cache shared HFiIe reader/log scanner Pair and never close them which cause no damage during concurrent reading.\r\n\r\nAlso add a UT to verify this problem, without this patch, UT will failed and throw:\r\n```\r\n357  [main] WARN  org.apache.hadoop.util.NativeCodeLoader  - Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n`REPLACE_COMMIT_ACTION` is used for different write operations like clustering, insert_overwrite or insert_overwrite_table. However, there is a difference between whether requested/inflight replace commit metadata has any content or not depending on the write operation. This PR attempts to fix that and avoid NPE due to empty replacecommit metadata. We should ideally have a standard for replacecommit metadata as pointed out in HUDI-1739.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nTransformers such as `SqlQueryBasedTransformer` creates a temp view with a random name for every batch of incoming data, but they are never freed.\r\n\r\nThis causes a memory leak in SparkSession's HiveCatalog.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - In `Sql{File,Query}BasedTransformer` and `FlatteningTransformer`, drop the temp view before returning the transformed dataframe\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIn latest master, the unit tests in hudi-integ-test module are not executed in CI.  This PR adds a task in CI to run unit tests in hudi-integ-test.  This PR also fixes three issues causing test failures: (1) Fixes the generation of yaml file based on DAG because of new schema; (2) Set \"none\" if there is no dependency of a DAG node; (3) Fixes wrong logic in `TestDeleteConverter#testGenerateDeleteRecordsFromInputRecords()`; (4) Fixes wrong size in `TestGenericRecordPayloadEstimator#testSimpleSchemaSize()`.  The rest failed tests are disabled and going to be addressed by HUDI-3668.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Adds a task in CI to run unit tests of hudi-integ-test module in `azure-pipelines.yml`\r\n- Fixes the generation of yaml file based on DAG in `DagUtils`\r\n- Fixes a few unit tests: `TestDeleteConverter#testGenerateDeleteRecordsFromInputRecords()`, `TestGenericRecordPayloadEstimator#testSimpleSchemaSize()`\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests in hudi-integ-test module.\r\n\r\n##

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nBy default, for Deltastreamer and Spark datasource, if the key generator class is not configured by the user, the `SimpleKeyGenerator` is used by default.  However, the table upgrade from v2 to v3 still expects explicit key generator class config for Spark and fails if not set.  This PR sets the key generator class to `org.apache.hudi.keygen.SimpleKeyGenerator` for Spark client if it is not set in the write configs, so that the table upgrade can succeed without the following validation error.\r\n```\r\n22/03/14 12:28:10 ERROR HoodieDeltaStreamer: Shutting down delta-sync due to exception\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Missing config: Key: 'hoodie.table.keygenerator.class' , default: null description: Key Generator class property for the hoodie table since version: version is not defined deprecated after: version is not defined) or Key: 'hoodie.datasource.write.keygenerator.class' , default: null description: Key generator class, that implements `org.apache.hudi.keygen.KeyGenerator` extract a key out of incoming records. since version: version is not defined deprecated after: version is not defined)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Adds logic of setting default key generator class for Spark client in `TwoToThreeUpgradeHandler` \r\n- Adds tests in `TestTwoToThreeUpgradeHandler` (`hudi-client-common`) and `TestUpgradeDowngrade` (`hudi-spark-client`)\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change adds tests in `TestTwoToThreeUpgradeHandler` (`hudi-client-common`) and `TestUpgradeDowngrade` (`hudi-spark-client`) for spark client to verify the upgrade logic is expected.\r\n\r\nI also tested this PR by writing a MOR table with Hudi 0.9.0 deltastreamer without setting `hoodie.datasource.write.keygenerator.class` first, and then using the build from this PR to continue writing the same table with the same configs.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWith continuous mode deltastreamer, there is no way to trigger gracefull shutdown. This patch is adding a post write termination strategy giving an option to users to trigger shutdown if need be. For eg, if there is no new data to consume from source, users may wish to shutdown the continuous mode and restart the pipeline after sometime instead of having the pipeline running all the time. For instance, users can configure graceful shutdown if there is no new data from source for 5 consecutive times. Here is the interface for the termination strategy. \r\n\r\nAlso, this might help in bootstrapping new a new table. instead of doing one bulk load or bulk_insert leverage a large cluster for a large input of data, one could start deltastreamer on continuous mode and add a shutdown strategy to terminate once all data has been bootstrapped. this way, each batch could be smaller and may not need a large cluster to bootstrap data. \r\n\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * Post write termination strategy for deltastreamer in continuous mode.\r\n */\r\npublic interface PostWriteTerminationStrategy {\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Returns whether deltastreamer needs to be shutdown.\r\n   * @param scheduledCompactionInstantAndWriteStatuses optional pair of scheduled compaction instant and write statuses.\r\n   * @return true if deltastreamer has to be shutdown. false otherwise.\r\n   */\r\n  boolean shouldShutdown(Option<Pair<Option<String>, JavaRDD<WriteStatus>>> scheduledCompactionInstantAndWriteStatuses);\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding NoNewDataTerminationStrategy as one of the concrete impl.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added a postWriteTerminationStrategy to deltastreamer continuous mode. One can enable by setting the appropriate termination strategy using `DeltastreamerConfig.postWriteTerminationStrategyClass`. If not, continuous mode is expected to run forever. \r\n- Added one concrete impl for termination strategy as NoNewDataTerminationStrategy which shuts down deltastreamer if there is no new data to consume from source for N consecutive rounds. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added tests to

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the assert of `FileStatus::getAccessTime` which is flaky on rare occasions (the difference is in ms as shown below), since the access time can be changed when reading the file to get the file status for the expected and actual.  This only affects `testReadInlineFile()`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.hudi.common.fs.inline.TestInLineFileSystem.testReadInlineFile\r\n[ERROR]   Run 1:

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Added multi-writer test support to integ test framework. With this support, two jobs can concurrently run (1 deltastreamer and 1 spark datasource ) writing to same hudi table. Each job will do localized validation (for the data ingested by self). \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added a new job called HoodieMultiWriterTestSuiteJob, which can be used to trigger multiple concurrent jobs. \r\n- Fixed sparkdatasource test nodes integ test to de-couple from deltastreamer checkpointing. \r\n- Added properties and yamls for multi-writer tests \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- Verified by running a job locally\r\n```\r\nspark-submit --packages org.apache.spark:spark-avro_2.11:2.4.0 --conf spark.task.cpus=3 --conf spark.executor.cores=3 --conf

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdd a new module `hudi-metastore`\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nHoodieMetastoreBasedTimeline\r\nHoodieMetastoreFileSystemView\r\nMetaStore has three parts：\r\n- client, connects with server by Thrift\r\n- service, is divided into tableService, partitionService, timelineService and snapshotService\r\n- store, has a relation db based implementation with the power of MyBatis\r\n\r\nWriting a commit/deltacommit is available, but read is not ready.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\nFor test, metastore will start up with an embedded one. \r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- Add metastore client ut\r\n- Add metastore store ut\r\n- Add a case of cow writing based on metastore \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n- [ ] add a new section on website for introduction\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs
