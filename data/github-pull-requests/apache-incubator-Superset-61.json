This PR changes the removal logic so that all controls that start with the text `adhoc_filters` are cleaned from extra filters before saving. The logic is added both to the deprecated backend logic (set for removal in 3.0) and the new frontend logic which cleans the extra adhoc filters before sending the request to the v1 chart API.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nWith this fix the extra filters are removed from the second query of the mixed chart (notice there are no extra filters in the adhoc filter control):\r\n<img width=\"934\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/189840746-da6f01da-ecc0-447c-8fe9-75b52bd899cc.png\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously saving the mixed chart with an extra filter would persist the extra filters in the chart metadata:\r\n<img width=\"944\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/189840416-eb1edb37-77b1-480a-ae51-4051a7deed29.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, the new version of Charts especially Echart VIZs supported a Time or Categorical column as the X-Axis when the Feature Flag `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` was enabled. This feature would be disabled if FF was disabled, so the _Pivot Index_ in some `Post Processing operators` would be set to `__timestamp` for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to move related codes into a helper function and removed unused property: `is_timeseries` in query_object. The `is_timeseries` only was used for the legacy Viz endpoint rather than the V1 Viz endpoint, so it's a safe refactor.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the default timeout set in the cache config is not respected in v1 chart data requests. Notice specifically how the following lines in `viz.py` are missing in `query_context_processor.py`: https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/79cb2682796aeb6848f807ac898195d2aec1cfce/superset/viz.py#L434-L435\r\n\r\nIn addition, `custom_cache_timeout` was missing from the chart data request schema, making it impossible to override the defaults. This PR fixes both errors and adds tests to cover default timeout, cache config timeout and custom timeout.\r\n\r\nFinally, it appears we've been running the unit tests every time we run integration tests (this can be confirmed by looking at integration CI workflows which execute unit tests after integration tests). This changes the integration test script so that only the integration tests are executed.\r\n\r\nSee CI output after (1732 items):\r\n<details>\r\nRunning tests\r\n============================= test session starts ==============================\r\nplatform linux -- Python 3.8.13, pytest-6.2.4, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1\r\nrootdir: /home/runner/work/superset/superset, configfile: pytest.ini\r\nplugins: pyfakefs-4.5.6, cov-2.12.1, mock-3.6.1\r\ncollected 1732 items\r\n\r\ntests/integration_tests/access_tests.py .....................

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR is a proof of concept for dashboard virtualization.\r\nDue to a performance issues on large dashboards (60+ charts in a single tab/view), this PR introduces virtualization in an attempt to reduce the number of elements (DOM nodes) rendered at once.\r\nIn the initial state, we render only the charts in current viewport and charts max 1 view height away from current viewport.\r\nWhen user scrolls down, charts that cross the 1 view height margin get rendered too.\r\nWe remove charts from DOM tree when they are at least 4 view heights away from current viewport.\r\nThose values were chosen arbitrarily/experimentally to provide good middle-ground between memory efficiency and good user experience when scrolling up/down.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up: if chart is not rendered and it's less than 1 view height away from viewport - render it; if chart is rendered and it's more than 4 view heights away from viewport - remove it from DOM\r\n\r\nRerendering charts do NOT trigger new queries - we reuse data fetched on dashboard mount and only redraw the charts.\r\n\r\nAs of now, this feature is in proof-of-concept faze and should be considered as experimental. It's hidden behind a feature flag `DASHBOARD_VIRTUALIZATION`\r\n\r\nVirtualization is disabled for bot workers (like Celery) to ensure that reports and alerts work correctly\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/194769147-c8060f15-6ea9-403b-aaf0-8270227b94a1.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0. Enable FF `DASHBOARD_VIRTUALIZATION`\r\n1. Open a dashboard with a lot of charts\r\n2. Scroll up and down - verify that only the charts in current viewport (or close to it - 100% margin) are rendered. The rest of them displays a spinner and loads only when user scroll them into view\r\n4. Verify that charts render when user scrolls, but do not send new queries to the backend\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently the drag preview of `react-dnd` was broken since we introduce `position: 'fixed'` inside the drag container from   [#21198](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21198/files#diff-ea949f68550922078a8f7fb0b3d73d166697eaa03d01d6b0178cfa66feb1ac06L114). To fix this, we use `createPortal` to ensure that the parent container is not affected and that the dropdown is also displayed properly.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### before\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/189573591-61756ae5-ab2d-4944-add2-fd7408c29ee0.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n#### after\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/189573411-91bb0976-37b7-4a38-9b4a-340ba19efccf.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

ability for Explore to fallback to default Explore form state (based on chart id or datasource id) had cached form data expires. But this feature is not working for Explore from SQL Lab---because of inconsistent URL parameter names. The `/explore` API expects `dataset_id=xxx`, but SQL Lab page added `datasource_id=xxx`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue and added some backward compatibility so that both `datasource_id` and `dataset_id` works.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nWhen visiting Explore from SQL Lab, You will get `missing_datasource` if your explore form data has expired.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1116\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/189445944-36425bc1-1221-4576-a0ac-12717a7461d4.png\">\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\nExplore should load as long as a valid `dataset_id` is provided\r\n\r\n<img width=\"918\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/189447544-f2196672-6346-4271-a770-46ecef7eba29.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Open Explore from SQL Lab query results\r\n2. Change the `form_data_key` to an invalid string to simulate expired form data key. For example: http://localhost:9000/explore/?form_data_key=invalid&datasource_id=45&datasource_type=query\r\n3. The Explore page should still load.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWindows does not have a bold version of `Lucida Console` installed by default. [[1]](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2074#:~:text=Lucida%20Console%20is%20a%20preinstalled%20font%20in%20Windows.%20It%20does%20not%20have%20a%20built%20in%20bold%20version.%20Compare%20with%20Courier%20New%3A) [[2]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/fonts/windows_10_font_list#:~:text=5.05-,Lucida%20Console,-Lucida%20Console)\r\nInstead, Windows creates a fake bold version of the font, which is slightly wider. [[3]](https://forums.allroundautomations.com/ubb/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=29702#:~:text=issue%20with%20in%20the%20font)\r\n\r\nIn the SQL lab editor this leads to the cursor alignment issues linked below.\r\n\r\n`Consolas` and `Courier New` both come with bold monospaced version pre-installed on Windows [[2]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/fonts/windows_10_font_list#:~:text=5.05-,Lucida%20Console,-Lucida%20Console) and cause no issues with cursor alignment. That is why I am proposing to change the order of the fonts.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nAvailable in any of the linked issues\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nRequirement: Windows machine with standard fonts, meaning `Menlo` is not installed, `Lucida Console` is installed, but missing the bold version.\r\n\r\nThen just type any SQL keyword the SQL lab editor, such as `SELECT * FROM table_name`.\r\nThe cursor is no longer aligned over the word table_name. \r\nThis is fixed when the font order is changed via the browser's development tools\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, The Time Offset can't be used in SQLite as datasouce, it's because the Pandas + SQLAlchemy query from SQLite will return `datetime` column as `object` rather than `datetime`.\r\n\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n... from sqlalchemy import create_engine\r\n... import pandas as pd\r\n\r\n... sqlite_engine = create_engine(\"sqlite:////some-path/examples_sqlite.db\")\r\n... sql_sqlite = '''\r\nSELECT * FROM main.birth_names_sqlite\r\nlimit 1\r\n'''\r\n... df = pd.read_sql(sql_sqlite, sqlite_engine)\r\n... df.dtypes\r\n...\r\nds        object\r\ngender    object\r\nname      object\r\nnum        int64\r\nstate     object\r\ndtype: object\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR uses the original `normalize_dttm_col` function but adds a new argument for it. the `normalize_dttm_col` will convert the old `__timestamp` column or the new `BASE_AXIS` to the Timestamp series in pandas.\r\n\r\nIn addition, added a new unit test for Time Grain and Time Offset in the QueryObject.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### After\r\nFF

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIf the data section (results/samples) is collapsed, user can still drag the icon/object between chart and data section header to resize the chart. This behavior is confusing as in this case the data section remains collapsed and empty.\r\n\r\nSo we remove drag indicator/feature if the data section is collapsed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### before\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/189017103-24c2c272-2fba-42dd-8b56-0fd87108395c.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n#### after\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/189016760-60e1de08-8d63-408a-9c8f-2903137a7366.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR does some code cleanup, adds/updates testing, and extends support for Drill to Detail to additional edge cases.\r\n\r\n- **Code DRYing for right-click and chart header dropdown Drill to Detail menus.**  Right-click menu and chart header dropdown menu currently relies on some duplicated code between the `SliceHeaderControls` and `Chart` components.  This PR combines/moves all Drill to Detail code to `Chart/DrillDetail`.\r\n- **Tests for menu items.**  Drill to Detail menu items currently lacks unit tests.  This PR adds some.\r\n- **Basic fallback support for right-click Drill to Detail menus for all viz plugins.**  Right-click Drill to Detail support is currently limited to viz plugins that have been updated to handle the `contextmenu` event.  This PR adds a fallback `contextmenu` event handler to the `ChartRenderer` chart wrapper that allows access to Drill to Detail without any filters, just like what's currently possible from the chart header menu.\r\n- **Updated menu hierarchy.**  The right-click menu currently shows all items as a flat list.  This PR updates the right-click menu to have a top-level \"Drill to detail\" menu item that opens the D2D modal with no filters and a \"Drill to detail by\" submenu that contains \"Drill to detail by XXX\" menu items that open the D2D modal with filters.\r\n- **Support for additional states.**: This PR updates the right-click menu and header dropdown menus to behave as follows in the following situations:\r\n  - **Viz plugin has not been updated to handle the `contextmenu` event:** right-click menu has enabled \"Drill to detail\" and enabled \"Drill to detail by\" submenu containing just a message noting the lack of support.  Header dropdown menu has enabled \"Drill to detail\".\r\n  - **Viz plugin has been updated, but the chart doesn't group data by dimension:** right-click menu has disabled \"Drill to detail\" with an explanatory tooltip and disabled \"Drill to detail by\" submenu.  Header dropdown menu has disabled \"Drill to detail\" with an explanatory tooltip.\r\n  - **Viz plugin has been updated and the chart groups data by dimension:** right-click menu has enabled \"Drill to detail\" and enabled \"Drill to detail by\" submenu.  If you right-clicked on a valid dimension value, it'll contain \"Drill to detail by\" options.  If you didn't, it'll contain an explanatory message.  Header dropdown menu has enabled \"Drill to detail\".\r\n\r\n#### Notes for adding/improving Drill to Detail support for viz plugins\r\n- If a plugin hasn't been updated to explicitly support Drill to Detail, header dropdown menu and right-click menu Drill to Detail will work, but the \"Drill to detail by\" submenu will contain a message saying the chart doesn't have support.\r\n- To update a plugin to support Drill to Detail, handle the `contextmenu` event such that the `onContextMenu` chart hook gets called with filters corresponding to whatever dimension(s) the user right-clicked on.\r\n- To mark a plugin as supported, add the `Behavior.DRILL_TO_DETAIL` behavior to the plugin's `ChartMetadata` instance.  The Drill to Detail menu component checks for this behavior whenever `onContextMenu` is called without filters to determine if it should show the \"not yet supported\" message or the \"you didn't select a dimension\" message.  Therefore, if you add the `Behavior.DRILL_TO_DETAIL` behavior, you can let the fallback handler catch right-clicks to parts of the chart that don't correspond to dimension values and the menu will correctly interpret these clicks as clicks not corresponding to a dimension rather than clicks to an unsupported chart.\r\n- Drill to Detail should be disabled in situations when a viz plugin is not grouping data by dimension, as there aren't any aggregations to de-aggregate.  To indicate when this is the case for a viz plugin, add a `noAggregations` function to the viz plugin's `ChartMetadata` instance that receives `formData` as a param and returns `true` if the chart contains only atomic data.\r\n\r\ncc: @kasiazjc @michael-s-molina \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n1.

[this](https://apache-superset.slack.com/archives/G013HAE6Y0K/p1662183800347719) Slack thread Airbnb ran into an issue where a regression in the FAB API resulted in us deleting almost all our metrics in the metadata database rather than those associated with the table we believed we were filtering by.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't remedy said issue, however it exposes the `table_id` column as a listable column for the SqlMetricInlineView and TableColumnInlineView classes so we can validate that the response payload is correct, i.e., if we have a query like `/tablecolumninlineview/api/read?_flt_0_table_id=1` we can then assert that all the `table_id`s match the specified filter.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nTested the two API read endpoints locally and confirmed the `table_id` column was included.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR is part of a tech debt initiative. It proposes several enhancements to the Cypress suite and runtime improvements, as follows:\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances the `dashboard`, `dashboard list`, `chart list`,  `dataset`, `alerts_and_reports` and `database`  suites.\r\n\r\n- It reduces the time of execution of about 10 minutes\r\n- It reduces to the minimum the number of page reloads\r\n- Introduces a new pattern to create sample charts and dashboards on the fly via fixtures\r\n- It introduces certain Cypress best standards, such as preferring `data-test` and provides utils such as `getBySel` \r\n- It creates several util functions that can be used across the entire suite or for specific areas\r\n- It adds the `_skip` prefix to those files that had all their tests skipped so that it is easier to spot them\r\n- It reorganizes the directory structure and places tests that fall under the same category within the same test files\r\n- It increases test coverage for the dashboards and charts lists\r\n\r\n### WHAT'S NEXT\r\n- All the `_skip` files should be fixed and their tests enhanced following the new patterns\r\n- All the tests that are skipped within any file should be fixed or removed\r\n- Implement the same patterns for the remaining tests, such as directories `explore`, `sqllab`\r\n- Should we remove the support/directories file? I disagree that's a good way to keep Cypress organized\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nAll tests should pass and quicker\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required

SUMMARY\r\nWe are adding four methods inside superset/db_engine_specs/bigquery.py\r\n\r\nFor now only Postgres and Presto had cost estimation capabilities. For that they used the **cursor** object. \r\nBigquery needs to use a **dry run** to get the query cost estimation. Sadly, you can't use the cursor to execute dry runs (I have tried). And that's why there is a need to override the two functions. **estimate_statement_cost** and **estimate_query_cost**. The other two methods **get_allow_cost_estimate**  and **query_cost_formatter** are just added because the base class doesn't have functionality or gives a False. \r\n\r\nAlso the QueryEditor.py object doesn't have sqlEditorId anymore in it's variables and the Cost Estimation Reducer is looking for it, thus giving error, that is also changed. \r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

It's the same PR as #20366. However, there were some issues with formatting and the pipelines (mainly because of lacking understanding on my side). So for this few-lines change, I guess it is easier I open a new PR and close the old one, rather than trying to fix the messed up old one...\r\n\r\n## SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThere should be padding between rows in a dashboard. Before, this did not work when the rows where within tabs. This is fixed here.\r\nSee this issue: #20303\r\n\r\n## BEFORE SCREENSHOT\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1052\" alt=\"173444283-a448a1d8-4217-44ef-998a-64bab1ee42b5\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16560193/188325508-ac895e15-274a-4656-9435-ec97d6d45457.png\">\r\n\r\n## AFTER SCREENSHOT\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1052\" alt=\"173444094-e4447879-64d1-494f-bcf3-6ee67ca5ce9a\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16560193/188325522-752601e9-ed14-484f-82c8-a41ede07c067.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n* Insert two charts into a new dashboard\r\n* Add a filter. When hovering over a filter, the selection box shows some space between the plots\r\n* When you move the charts into tabs, there is no space between plots any more (see first screenshot) \r\n* AFTER APPLYING CHANGES FROM PR:\r\n* Now there is also some space when the charts are within tabs (see second screenshot).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-04T17:19:09Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T18:30:17Z","closed_at":"2022-09-05T06:14:38Z","merged_at":"2022-09-05T06:14:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"d994babe754a0a8fcf54d239cb4c558ccdf84b23","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329183122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MTgzMTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XS","name":"size/XS","color":"E2D8FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6575674535,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABh_DUpw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%9A%A2%202.1.0","name":"üö¢

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWe want add snowflake in superset, but our snowflake is using SSO authentication so we can't add it with built-in snowflake connector, we found we can connect it with snowflake keypair authentication. so I modified connector file to support keypair authentication. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this

SUMMARY\r\nThis is a new feature where we can have a shared switchboard singleton instance available. The idea is to be able to send the interactions happening from the embedded dashboard back to the parent loading the iframe. Another thing is to be able to send any details or data like what filters are selected by the user back to the parent loading the iframe. Now for that we need to have a shared state maintained which can be accessed from the plugins which are actually rendered into the dashboards. For this, a singleton instance of Switchboard which can be lazily initialised has been added. Now the embedded dashboard will use this singleton instance instead of initialising its own.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nEmbedded dashboards should render without any issue like before.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing
