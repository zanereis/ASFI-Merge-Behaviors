is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13309).\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9139, we added backward iterator on SessionStore. But there is a bug that  when fetch/backwardFetch the key range, if there are multiple records in the same session window, we can't return the data in the correct order.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nWe have a session window inactivity gap with 10 ms, and the records:\r\n\r\nkey: \"A\", value: \"AA\", timestamp: 0 --> with SessionWindow(0, 0)\r\nkey: \"B\", value: \"BB\", timestamp: 0 --> with SessionWindow(0, 0)\r\nkey: \"C\", value: \"CC\", timestamp: 0 --> with SessionWindow(0, 0)\r\nkey: \"D\" value: \"DD\", timestamp: 100 --> with SessionWindow(100, 100)\r\n\r\nSo, when fetch(\"A\" /*key from*/, \"D\" /*key to*/), we expected to have [A, B, C, D], but we'll have [C, B A, D ]\r\n\r\nAnd the reason is that we pass \"false\" in the \"is forward\" parameter for `fetch` method, and \"true\" for \"backwardFetch\" method, which obviously is wrong.\r\n\r\nSo, why does the tests can't find this issue? \r\nIt's because the test data we provided doesn't have multiple data in the same

[11231](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11231) we fixed a bug in which the consumer would reset its state unnecessarily, and fixed up the tests accordingly. Unfortunately this also wiped out the test coverage for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12983 that was added in [10986](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10986).\r\n\r\nI noticed this when cherrypicking that fix back to the 2.7 branch and hitting merge conflicts in the test.

the changes for topic IDs, we have a different flow. When a broker receives a request, it uses a map to convert the topic ID to topic names. If the topic ID is not found in the map, we return a top level error and close the session. This decision was motivated by the difficulty to store “unresolved” partitions in the session. In earlier iterations we stored an “unresolved” partition object in the cache, but it was somewhat hard to reason about and required extra logic to try to resolve the topic ID on each incremental request and add to the session. It also required extra logic to forget the topic (either by topic ID if the topic name was never known or by topic name if it was finally resolved when we wanted to remove from the session.)\r\n\r\nOne helpful simplifying factor is that we only allow one type of request (uses topic ID or does not use topic ID) in the session. That means we can rely on a session continuing to have the same information. We don’t have to worry about converting topics only known by name to topic ID for a response and we won’t need to convert topics only known by ID to name for a response.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a change to store the \"unresolved partitions\" in the cached partition object. If a version 13+ request is sent with a topic ID that is unknown, a cached partition will be created with that fetch request data and a null topic name. On subsequent incremental requests, unresolved partitions may be resolved with the new IDs found in the metadata cache. When handling the request, getting all partitions will return a TopicIdPartition object that will be used to handle the request and build the response. Since we can rely on only one type of request (with IDs or without), the cached partitions map will have different keys depending on what fetch request version is being used. \r\n\r\nThis PR involves changes both in FetchSessionHandler and FetchSession. Some major changes are outlined below.\r\n\r\n1. FetchSessionHandler: Forgetting a topic and adding a new topic with the same name -  We may have a case where there is a topic foo with ID 1 in the session. Upon a subsequent metadata update, we may have topic foo with ID 2. This means that topic foo has been deleted and recreated. When sending fetch requests version 13+ we will send a request to add foo ID 2 to the session and remove foo ID 1. Otherwise, we will fall back to the same behavior for versions 12 and below\r\n\r\n2. FetchSession: Resolving in Incremental Sessions - Incremental sessions contain two distinct sets of partitions. Partitions that are sent in the latest request that are new/updates/forgotten partitions and the partitions already in the session. If we want to resolve unknown topic IDs we will need to handle both cases.\r\n    * Partitions in the request  - These partitions are either new or updating/forgetting previous partitions in the session. The new partitions are trivial. We either have a resolved partition or create a partition that is unresolved. For the other cases, we need to be a bit more careful. \r\n        * For updated partitions we have a few cases – keep in mind, we may not programmatically know if a partition is an update:\r\n            1. partition in session is resolved, update is resolved: trivial \r\n            2. partition in session is unresolved, update is unresolved: in code, this is equivalent to the case above, so trivial as well \r\n            3. partition in session is unresolved, update is resolved: this means the partition in the session does not have a name, but the metadata cache now contains the name –  to fix this we can check if there exists a cached partition with the given ID and update it both with the partition update and with the topic name. \r\n            4. partition in session is resolved, update is unresolved: this means the partition in the session has a name, but the update was unable to be resolved (ie, the topic is deleted) – this is the odd case. We will look up the partition using the ID. We will find the old version with a name but will not replace the name. This will lead to an UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION or INCONSISTENT_TOPIC_ID error which will be handled with a metadata update. Likely a future request will forget the partition, and we will be able to do so by ID. \r\n            5. Two partitions in the session have IDs, but they are different: only one topic ID should exist in the metadata at a time, so likely only one topic ID is in the fetch set. The other one should be in the toForget. We will be able to remove this partition from the session. If for some reason, we don't try to forget this partition — one of the partitions in the session will cause an inconsistent topic ID error and the metadata for this partition will be refreshed — this should result in the old ID being removed from the session. This should not happen if the FetchSessionHandler is correctly in sync. \r\n        * For the forgotten partitions we have the same cases:\r\n            1. partition in session is resolved, forgotten is resolved: trivial \r\n            2. partition in session is unresolved, forgotten is unresolved: in code, this is equivalent to the case above, so trivial as well \r\n            3. partition in session is unresolved, forgotten is resolved: this means the partition in the session does not have a name, but the metadata cache now contains the name –  to fix this we can check if there exists a cached partition with the given ID and try to forget it before we check the resolved name case. \r\n            4. partition in session is resolved, update is unresolved: this means the partition in the session has a name, but the update was unable to be resolved (ie, the topic is deleted) We will look up the partition using the ID. We will find the old version with a name and be able to delete it. \r\n            5. both partitions in the session have IDs, but they are different: This should be the same case as described above. If we somehow do not have the ID in the session, no partition will be removed. This should not happen unless the Fetch Session Handler is out of sync. \r\n    * Partitions in the session - there may be some partitions in the session already that are unresolved. We can resolve them in forEachPartition using a method that checks if the partition is unresolved and tries to resolve it using a topicName map from the request.

https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10112\r\n\r\nReplaces the current batch-based logic for offset commits with a dynamic, non-blocking approach outlined in discussion on #10112 [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10112#issuecomment-910510910), [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10112#issuecomment-910540773), [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10112#issuecomment-914348989), [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10112#issuecomment-914547745), and [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10112#issuecomment-915350922).\r\n\r\nEssentially, a deque is kept for every source partition that a source task produces records for, and each element in that deque is a `SubmittedRecord` with a flag to track whether the producer has ack'd the delivery of that source record to Kafka yet. Periodically, the worker (on the same thread that polls the source task for records and transforms, converts, and dispatches them to the producer) polls acknowledged elements from the beginning of each of these deques and collects the latest offsets from these elements, storing them in a snapshot that is then committed on the separate source task offset thread.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of the `offset.flush.timeout.ms` property is retained, but essentially now only applies to the actual writing of offset data to the internal offsets topic (if running in distributed mode) or the offsets file (if running in standalone mode). No time is spent during `WorkerSourceTask::commitOffsets` blocking on the acknowledgment of records by the producer.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that memory exhaustion may occur if, for example, a single Kafka partition is offline for an extended period. In cases like this, the collection of deques in the `SubmittedRecords` class may continue to grow indefinitely until the partition comes back online and the `SubmittedRecord`s in those deques that targeted the formerly-offline Kafka partition are acknowledged and can be removed. Although this may be suboptimal, it is no worse than the existing behavior of the framework in these cases.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

ReplicaManager, LogManager, and KafkaApis class all have many\r\nconstructor parameters. It is often difficult to add or remove a\r\nparameter, since there are so many locations that need to be updated. In\r\norder to address this problem, we should use named parameters when\r\nconstructing these objects from Scala code. This will make it easy to\r\nadd new optional parameters without modifying many test cases.  It will\r\nalso make it easier to read git diffs and PRs, since the parameters will\r\nhave names next to them.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, this PR updates the Scala code to use named parameters.\r\nSince Java does not support named parameters, this PR adds several Builder\r\nclasses which can be used to achieve the same effect from Java code.\r\n\r\nReplicaManager also had a secondary constructor, which this PR removes.\r\nThe function of the secondary constructor was just to provide some\r\ndefault parameters for the main constructor. However, it is simpler to just\r\nuse default

3.6.0 changed the default configuration for JUTE_MAXBUFFER from 4 MB to 1 MB.\r\nThis causes a regression if Kafka tries to retrieve a large amount of data across many\r\nznodes – in such a case the ZooKeeper client will repeatedly emit a message of the form\r\n\"java.io.IOException: Packet len <####> is out of range\".\r\n\r\nWe restore the 3.4.x/3.5.x behavior unless the caller has set the property (note that ZKConfig\r\nauto configures itself if certain system properties have been set).\r\n\r\nI added a unit test that fails without the change and passes with it.\r\n\r\nI also refactored the code to streamline the way we handle parameters passed to\r\nKafkaZkClient and ZooKeeperClient.\r\n \r\nSee https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/1129 for the details on why the behavior\r\nchanged in 3.6.0.\r\n\r\nCredit to @rondagostino for finding and reporting this issue.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

(kafka.server.ReplicaFetcherThread)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is due to a race condition in `ReplicaManager#applyLocalFollowersDelta`. The `InitialFetchState` is created and populated before the partition is removed from the fetcher threads. This means that the fetch offset of the `InitialFetchState` could be outdated when the fetcher threads are re-started because the fetcher threads could have incremented the log end offset in between.\r\n\r\nThe patch fixes the issue by removing the partitions from the replica fetcher threads before creating the `InitialFetchState` for them.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

introducing backward iterator for WindowStroe in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9138, we forgot to make \"each segment\" in reverse order (i.e. in `descendingMap`) in `InMemoryWindowStore`. Fix it and add integration tests for it.\r\n\r\nCurrently, in Window store, we store records in [segments -> [records] ].\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nwindow size = 500,\r\ninput records:\r\n\r\nkey: \"a\", value: \"aa\", timestamp: 0 ==> will be in [0, 500] window\r\nkey: \"b\", value: \"bb\", timestamp: 10 ==> will be in [0, 500] window\r\nkey: \"c\", value: \"cc\", timestamp: 510 ==> will be in [500, 1000] window\r\n\r\nSo, internally, the \"a\" and \"b\" will be in the same segment, and \"c\" in another segments.\r\nsegments: [0 /* window start */, records], [500, records].\r\nAnd the records for window start 0 will be \"a\" and \"b\".\r\nthe records for window start 500 will be \"c\".\r\n\r\nBefore this change, we did have a reverse iterator for segments, but not in \"records\". So, when doing backwardFetchAll, we'll have the records returned in order: \"c\", \"a\", \"b\", which should be \"c\", \"b\", \"a\" obviously.\r\n\r\nSo, back to the question: why did the original test cases not catch this issue?\r\nIt's because the test input are all in different window start timestamp, which will have different different segments:\r\n\r\n```\r\n private void putFirstBatch(final WindowStore<Integer, String> store,\r\n                               @SuppressWarnings(\"SameParameterValue\") final long startTime,\r\n                               final InternalMockProcessorContext context) {\r\n        context.setRecordContext(createRecordContext(startTime));\r\n        store.put(0, \"zero\", startTime);\r\n        store.put(1, \"one\", startTime + 1L);\r\n        store.put(2, \"two\", startTime + 2L);\r\n        store.put(3, \"three\", startTime + 2L);  // <-- this is the new record I added, to test multiple records in the same segment case\r\n\r\n        store.put(4, \"four\", startTime + 4L);\r\n        store.put(5, \"five\", startTime + 5L);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI added an additional record for `AbstractWindowBytesStoreTest` test. `InWindowStoreFetchTest`, we will produce records in timestamp:0, 1, 500, 501, 502, which will be put into window: [0, 500] * 2 and [500, 1000] * 3. And we try to fetch them forward/backward, to see if the results are as expected, i.e.: in reverse order should be 502, 501, 500, 1, 0.\r\n\r\nThe behavior works as expected in RocksDBWindowStore.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

task is to provide a concrete implementation of the interfaces defined in KIP-255 to allow Kafka to connect to an OAuth/OIDC identity provider for authentication and token retrieval. While KIP-255 provides an unsecured JWT example for development, this will fill in the gap and provide a production-grade implementation.\r\n\r\nThe OAuth/OIDC work will allow out-of-the-box configuration by any Apache Kafka users to connect to an external identity provider service (e.g. Okta, Auth0, Azure, etc.). The code will implement the standard OAuth clientcredentials grant type.\r\n\r\nThe proposed change is largely composed of a pair of AuthenticateCallbackHandler implementations: one to login on the

rewrite of [KAFKA-12886](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11042) and including [KAFKA-13142](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11141) since it shares code with KAFKA-12886. \r\n\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n\r\n1. Enables request forwarding to the controller by default for zookeeper mutation protocols in `IBP >= 3.1`.\r\n2. Only the broker that a dynamic config applies to can validate its config update. This pr validates the configs from {Alter, IncrementalAlter}ConfigsRequest on the broker that the configs are for before they are forwarded to the active controller. If the validation fails, the proxy broker will send a response to the client with an ApiError. Otherwise they are forwarded to the active controller or persisted if the broker that did the validation is a pre-KRaft broker and is also the active controller. This PR introduces this new dynamic broker config behavior to both pre-KRaft and KRaft clusters. \r\n3. Refactor tests that did not expect pre-KRaft brokers to forward requests.\r\n\r\nTested new dynamic config behavior manually for both pre-KRaft and KRaft clusters.\r\n\r\nSTATUS: Design and major functionality done\r\nTODO: \r\n\r\n- Write new tests.\r\n- Refactor remaining failing tests that are not expecting pre-KRaft brokers to forward requests.\r\n- Find out where to validate Config Policy? where to validate topic configs? on broker before forwarding or on the controller? The KRaft controller only authorizes and validates the ConfigResource but not the actual configs. This PR only validates broker configs before the request is forwarded. It may be good to also validate topic configs on the brokers so that api behavior is consistent with before (send both a TOPIC and BROKER ConfigResource.Type alteration in one {Alter,IncrementalAlter}ConfigsRequest and get api errors for both if both configs are invalid instead of just an error for the broker

new topics are created through the admin interface, the Kafka controller creates the partition assignments for these topics according to the algorithm defined in `AdminUtils.assignReplicasToBrokers`. All (alive) brokers in the cluster become candidates for hosting partitions.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes cluster administrators don't want certain brokers to host partitions for newly created topics. This can be for a variety of reasons, e.g.:\r\n- a broker may be on a host that is slated for retirement and about to be shut down\r\n- a broker may be acting as a canary of a new Kafka version and is being tested with a controlled set of topic-partitions, and should be restricted from hosting any other topics\r\n- similarly, a broker may in use for administrative operations, such as dumping log segments, and consequently may be unstable and ideally as little-used as possible\r\n\r\nOne solution is for the cluster admins to not give out CREATE permissions to clients, and instead provide a service/abstraction for creating new topics with explicit partition assignments. Unfortunately, in a world with Kafka Streams applications, this is too restrictive: Kafka Streams clients expect to use the Kafka tooling to create topics when their topology changes, or when they need to reset their apps.\r\n\r\nSince there is currently there is no way to control which brokers are eligible to be assigned newly created partitions, I am proposing a new configuration parameter, `create.topic.broker.filter.policy.class.name` to allow cluster administrators to provide a pluggable class to control whether a broker should be allowed to host new partitions. The class implements a simple interface to give a binary yes/no verdict on each broker:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nboolean isAllowedToHostPartitions(Broker broker);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis follows a pattern similar to `create.topic.policy.class.name` and `alter.topic.policy.class.name`, which also provide cluster-level control over other aspects of topic creation.\r\n\r\nThis contribution is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project's open source license.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

configs that are read and used by Streams today originate from the properties passed in to the KafkaStreams constructor, which means they get applied universally across all threads, tasks, subtopologies, and so on. The only current exception to this is the `topology.optimization` config which is parsed from the properties that get passed in to `StreamsBuilder#build`. However there are a handful of configs that could also be scoped to the topology level, allowing users to configure each NamedTopology independently of the others, where it makes sense to do so.\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the handling of these configs by interpreting the values passed in via KafkaStreams constructor as the global defaults, which can then be overridden for individual topologies via the properties passed in when building the NamedTopology. More topology-level configs may be added in the future, but this PR covers the following:\r\n\r\n1. `max.task.idle.ms`\r\n2. `task.timeout.ms`\r\n3. `buffered.records.per.partition`\r\n4. `default.timestamp.extractor.class`\r\n5.

backport of #11248 broke the 2.8 build due to usage of the `EmbeddedKafkaCluster#stop` method, which used to be private. It seems we made this public when we upgraded to JUnit5 on the 3.0 branch and had to remove the ExternalResource that was previously responsible for calling `start()` and `stop()` for this class using the no-longer-available `@ClassRule` annotation. \r\n\r\nRather than adapt this test to the 2.8 style by migrating it to use `@ClassRule` as well, I opted to just make the `stop() method public as well (since its analogue `start()` has always been public anyways). This should hopefully prevent any future backports that include integration tests from having to manually go in and adapt the test, or accidentally break the build as happened

may expect `broker.id` to exist as a key in the config's various originals()-related maps, but with KRaft we rely solely on `node.id` for the broker's ID, and with the Zk-based brokers we provide the option to specify `node.id` in addition to (or as a full replacement for) `broker.id`.  There are multiple problems related to this switch to `node.id`:\r\n\r\n- We do not enforce consistency between explicitly-specified `broker.id` and `node.id` properties in the config – it is entirely possible right now that we could set `broker.id=0` and also set `node.id=1`, and the broker will use 1 for it's ID. This is confusing at best; the broker should detect this inconsistency and fail to start with a ConfigException.\r\n- When `node.id` is set, both that value and any explicitly-set `broker.id` value will exist in the config's **originals()-related maps**. Downstream components are often configured based on these maps, and they may ask for the `broker.id`, so downstream components may be misconfigured if the values differ, or they may fail during configuration if no `broker.id` key exists in the map at all.\r\n- The config's **values()-related maps** will contain either the explicitly-specified `broker.id` value or the default value of -1. When `node.id` is set, both that value (which cannot be negative) and the (potentially -1) `broker.id` value will exist in the config's values()-related maps. Downstream components are often configured based on these maps, and they may ask for the `broker.id`, so downstream components may be misconfigured if the `broker.id` value differs from the broker's true ID.\r\n\r\nThe broker should detect inconsistency between explicitly-specified `broker.id` and `node.id` values and fail startup accordingly.

What\r\nThe controller can skip sending `updateMetadataRequest` during the broker failure callback if there are offline partitions and the deleted brokers don't host any partitions. Looking at the logic, I'm not sure why the if check is checking for partitionsWithOfflineLeader. This seems like a bug which may also result in sending additional `updateMetadataRequests` on broker shutdowns.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAdded an integration test for the failure scenario that fails without the code change. The controller integration test suite passes locally with my change.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

Scalafix, a linter with some rewrite capabilities on\r\ntop (https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/)\r\n\r\nBy running the `checkScalafix` gradle tasks a report is printed with all\r\nbroken rules.\r\n\r\nRunning `scalafix` gradle task will apply some rewrites on the files,\r\nfor example: import ordering, and annotating return types.\r\nThis change uses the official gradle plugin for Scalafix, and Scalafix\r\nitself is maintained by the Scala Center.\r\n\r\nCurrent rules checked:\r\n- Do not allow `final var`\r\n- Explicit return types for public and protected methods (for public\r\n  `val` and `var` the change was too big. This can be done at a later\r\ntime)\r\n- Avoid procedure syntax in Scala\r\n- Avoid use of val in for comprehensions (it's a deprecated feature)\r\n\r\n*Known limitations*: when automatically inferring the return types,\r\nScalafix might fail and pick a \"too wide\" type, i.e. `Any` instead of\r\nthe correct one. After letting Scalafix fix the files, contributors\r\nshould still look at the changes done and validate they are correct.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

is an alternative approach in parallel to #11235. After several unsuccessful trials to improve its efficiency i've come up with a larger approach, which is to use a kv-store instead as the shared store, which would store the value as list<v>. The benefits of this approach are:\r\n\r\n1) Only serde once that compose <timestamp, byte, key>, at the outer metered stores, with less byte array copies.\r\n2) Deletes are straight-forward with no scan reads, just a single call to delete all duplicated <timestamp, byte, key> values.\r\n3) Using a KV store has less space amplification than a segmented window store.\r\n\r\nThe cons though:\r\n\r\n1) Each put call would be a get-then-write to append to the list; also we would spend a few more bytes to store the list (most likely a singleton list, and hence just 4 more bytes).\r\n2) It's more complicated definitely.. :)\r\n\r\nThe main idea is that since the shared store is actively GC'ed by the expiration logic, not based on time retention, and since that the key format is in <timestamp, byte, key>, the range expiration query is quite efficient as well.\r\n\r\nAdded testing covering for the list<value> stores (since we are still use kv-store interface, we cannot leverage on the get() calls in the stream-stream join, instead we use putIfAbsent and range only). Another minor factoring piggy-backed is to let `toList` to always close iterator to avoid leaking.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and
