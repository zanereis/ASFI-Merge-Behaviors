What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to replace `pyspark-connect` to `pyspark_connect` for its output name.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`setuptools` from 69.X.X changes the output name. It replaces dash in package name to underscore (`pyspark_connect-4.0.0.dev1.tar.gz` vs `pyspark-connect-4.0.0.dev1.tar.gz`), I think it is https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4214.\r\n\r\n###

PR backports https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46706 to branch 3.5.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR cleans up `mapIdToMapIndex` when the corresponding mapstatus is unregistered in three places:\r\n* `removeMapOutput`\r\n* `removeOutputsByFilter`\r\n* `addMapOutput` (old mapstatus overwritten)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere is only one valid mapstatus for the same `mapIndex` at the same time in Spark. `mapIdToMapIndex` should also follows the same rule to avoid chaos.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nExpression definitions should apply to the entire `With` child contains internally nested `WITH`, so refactor `RewriteWithExpression` logic.\r\nRewrite `With` consists of two steps:\r\n1. Convert defs into `Project` of inputPlans\r\n2. Replace the references in inputPlans and child then output the new child\r\n\r\n`With` support nestd, defs and child can all contain sub-With, the `Alias` generated by\r\nthe current `With` acts on the child and the child's internal `With`, so generate `Project` order is：\r\n1. internally nested with of main expression definitions\r\n2. main expression\r\n4. internally nested with of main expression\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOptimize `WITH` nested to apply to more scenarios, such as push down predicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRefactor data type json parse\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nthe `_all_atomic_types` causes confusions:\r\n\r\n- it is only used in json parse, so it should use the `jsonValue` instead of `typeName` (and so it causes the `typeName` not consistent with Scala, will fix in separate PR);\r\n- not all atomic types are included in it (e.g. `YearMonthIntervalType`);\r\n- not all atomic types should be placed in it (e.g. `VarcharType` which has to be excluded here and there)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nString titlecase conversion under UTF8_BINARY_LCASE and other ICU collations now work using the appropriate ICU default locale for character mapping, and uses ICU BreakIterator.getWordInstance to locate boundaries between words.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSimilar Spark expressions such as Lower & Upper use the same interface (UCharacter) to perform collation-aware string transformation, and InitCap should offer a consistant way to titlecase strings across the collation space.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, InitCap should now work properly for all collations other than UTF8_BINARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew and existing unit tests, as well as existing e2e sql tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-24T07:45:41Z","updated_at":"2024-06-10T16:18:21Z","closed_at":"2024-06-10T16:18:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4dd657cd61fc7e99e51acb0c2b69703752d5d856","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dbatomic","id":150942779,"node_id":"U_kgDOCP80Ow","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150942779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic","html_url":"https://github.com/dbatomic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46732/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46732/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46732/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/39285ba2c996f754baa5910480ceac71284792d6","head":{"label":"uros-db:initcap-icu","ref":"initcap-icu","sha":"39285ba2c996f754baa5910480ceac71284792d6","user":{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":755209418,"node_id":"R_kgDOLQOUyg","name":"spark","full_name":"uros-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db/spark","description":"Apache

this pull request?\r\nEnable collation support for hash join on complex types.\r\n\r\n- Logical plan is rewritten in analysis to (recursively) replace all non-binary strings with CollationKey\r\n- CollationKey is a unary expression that transforms StringType to BinaryType\r\n- Collation keys allow correct & efficient string comparison under specific collation rules\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove JOIN performance for complex types containing collated strings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Unit tests for `CollationKey` in `CollationExpressionSuite`\r\n- E2e SQL tests for `RewriteCollationJoin` in `CollationSuite`\r\n- Various queries with JOIN in existing TPCDS collation test suite\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nString lowercase/uppercase conversion in UTF8_BINARY_LCASE now works using ICU default locale, similar to how other ICU collations currently work in Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAll collations apart from UTF8_BINARY should use the same interface (UCharacter) that utilizes ICU toLowerCase/toUpperCase implementation, rather than mixing JVM & ICU implementations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests and e2e sql tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor FileFormatDataWriter we currently record metrics of \"task commit time\" and \"job commit time\" in `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.BasicWriteJobStatsTracker#metrics`:\r\n```\r\n      TASK_COMMIT_TIME -> SQLMetrics.createTimingMetric(sparkContext, \"task commit time\"),\r\n      JOB_COMMIT_TIME -> SQLMetrics.createTimingMetric(sparkContext, \"job commit time\"),\r\n```\r\nWe may also record the time spent on \"data write\" (together with the time spent on producing records from the iterator), which is usually one of the major parts of the total duration of a writing operation. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe find that the write duration is very helpful for us to identify the bottleneck and time skew during the data write, and it also helps on the generic performance tuning.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, in the SQL page of the Spark History Server (and live UI), a new \"data write time\" metric is shown on the data write command/operation nodes. For example, a `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand` node with the newly added `data write time` metric:\r\n<img width=\"492\" alt=\"image\"

authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-05-23T06:27:49Z","updated_at":"2024-09-12T00:22:57Z","closed_at":"2024-09-12T00:22:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d7e7bc11bac4d652303af68f88c3b3acac7c3ab8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46714/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46714/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46714/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/faa9901fc0923aebc392ab95836fa42ebb51932b","head":{"label":"jiwen624:duration_metrics","ref":"duration_metrics","sha":"faa9901fc0923aebc392ab95836fa42ebb51932b","user":{"login":"jiwen624","id":14141331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTQxMzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14141331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624","html_url":"https://github.com/jiwen624","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":800257984,"node_id":"R_kgDOL7L3wA","name":"spark","full_name":"jiwen624/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiwen624","id":14141331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTQxMzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14141331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624","html_url":"https://github.com/jiwen624","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiwen624/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nA new session level config `spark.sql.execution.coresLimitNumber` to configure the maximum number of cores can be used by SQL.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen there is a long-running shared Spark SQL cluster, there always be a situation where a large SQL occupies all the cores of the cluster, affecting the execution of other SQLs. Therefore, it is hoped that there is a configuration that can limit the maximum cores used by SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nyes, add new config `spark.sql.execution.coresLimitNumber`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI will add test unit later\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently if a property file is provided as argument to Spark submit, the `spark-defaults.conf` is ignored. This PR changes the behavior such that `spark-defaults.conf` is still loaded in this scenario, and any Spark configurations that are in the file but not in the input property file will be loaded.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently if a property file is provided as argument to Spark submit, the `spark-defaults.conf` is ignored. This causes inconveniences for users who want to split Spark configurations into the two. For example, in Spark on K8S users may want to store system wide default settings in `spark-defaults.conf`, while user specified configurations that are more dynamic in an property file and pass to Spark applications via `--properties-file` parameter. Currently this is not possible. See also https://github.com/kubeflow/spark-operator/issues/1321.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, now when a property file is provided via `--properties-file`, `spark-defaults.conf` will also be loaded. However, those configurations specified in the former will take precedence over the same configurations in the latter.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests and a new test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nin Spark SQL, add 'WITH OPTIONS' syntax to support dynamic relation options.   \r\n\r\nThis is a continuation of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41683 based on @cloud-fan's nice suggestion.\r\nThat was itself a continuation of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34072.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis will allow Spark SQL to have equivalence to DataFrameReader API.  For example, it is possible to specify options today to DataSources as follows via the API:\r\n\r\n```\r\n spark.read.format(\"jdbc\").option(\"fetchSize\", 0).load()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis pr allows an equivalent Spark SQL syntax to specify options:\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM jdbcTable WITH OPTIONS(`fetchSize` = 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test in DataSourceV2SQLSuite\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR cleans up `mapIdToMapIndex` when the corresponding mapstatus is unregistered in three places:\r\n* `removeMapOutput`\r\n* `removeOutputsByFilter`\r\n* `addMapOutput` (old mapstatus overwritten)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere is only one valid mapstatus for the same `mapIndex` at the same time in Spark. `mapIdToMapIndex` should also follows the same rule to avoid chaos.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nString comparison and hashing in UTF8_BINARY_LCASE is now context-unaware, and uses ICU root locale rules to convert string to lowercase at code point level, taking into consideration special cases for one-to-many case mapping. For example: comparing \"ΘΑΛΑΣΣΙΝΟΣ\" and \"θαλασσινοσ\" under UTF8_BINARY_LCASE now returns true, because Greek final sigma is special-cased in the new comparison implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. UTF8_BINARY_LCASE should use ICU root locale rules (instead of JVM)\r\n2. comparing strings under UTF8_BINARY_LCASE should be context-insensitive\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, comparing strings under UTF8_BINARY_LCASE will now give different results in two kinds of special cases (Turkish dotted letter \"i\" and Greek final letter \"sigma\").\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests in `CollationSupportSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-22T08:04:25Z","updated_at":"2024-06-06T19:05:32Z","closed_at":"2024-06-06T19:05:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"80a2cfef50af9bace85088c2b0a0cf474ae97687","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dbatomic","id":150942779,"node_id":"U_kgDOCP80Ow","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150942779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic","html_url":"https://github.com/dbatomic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46700/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46700/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46700/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9081478465d111cfe064cb57c16993721e53f5f9","head":{"label":"uros-db:lcase-casing","ref":"lcase-casing","sha":"9081478465d111cfe064cb57c16993721e53f5f9","user":{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":755209418,"node_id":"R_kgDOLQOUyg","name":"spark","full_name":"uros-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db/spark","description":"Apache

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThrough code tracking, I found that the folder corresponding to the partition on HDFS is generated by the 'AlterTableAddPartitionCommand' command, and whether the command is executed depends on whether the partition already exists in the metastore, which is the root cause of the non-idempotence. So we need to drop the updated part of the partitions from the metastore to initialize its state.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to replace `JVM assert` with `JUnit Assert` in tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nassert() statements do not produce

committedTaskPath\r\n`${outputpath}/_temporary//${appAttempId}/${taskId}`\r\nSo in #36564 's case, since before #38980, each task's job id's date is not the same,  when the task writes data success but fails to send back TaskSuccess RPC, the task rerun will commit to a different committedTaskPath then causing data duplicated.\r\n\r\nAfter #38980, for the same task's different attempts, the TaskId is the same now, when re-run task commit, will commit to the same committedTaskPath, and hadoop CommitProtocol will handle such case then data won't be duplicated.\r\n\r\nNote: The

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to exclude `io.netty:netty-tcnative-boringssl-static` from `zookeeper`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1.According to:\r\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty-tcnative/blob/c9b4b6ab62cdbfb4aab6ab3efb8dd7cf73f353ad/boringssl-static/pom.xml#L970-L982\r\nthe `io.netty:netty-tcnative-boringssl-static` is composed of:\r\n`io.netty:netty-tcnative-boringssl-static:linux-aarch_64`\r\n`io.netty:netty-tcnative-boringssl-static:linux-x86_64`\r\n`io.netty:netty-tcnative-boringssl-static:osx-aarch_64`\r\n`io.netty:netty-tcnative-boringssl-static:osx-x86_64`\r\n`io.netty:netty-tcnative-boringssl-staticwindows-x86_64`\r\nand our `common/network-common/pom.xml` file already explicitly depends on them.\r\n\r\n2.Their versions are different in `dev/deps/spark-deps-hadoop-3-hive-2.3`\r\n<img width=\"975\" alt=\"image\"

`netty` related exclusions, eg:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/pom.xml#L1838-L1842\r\n<img width=\"673\" alt=\"image\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46683#discussion_r1608527529 comment within Python, by using ID at the plan instead of DataFrame itself.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause the DataFrame holds the relation ID, if DataFrame B are derived from DataFrame A, and DataFrame A is garbage-collected, then the cache might not exist anymore. See the example below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndf = spark.range(1).localCheckpoint()\r\ndf2 = df.repartition(10)\r\ndel df\r\ndf2.collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.connect.SparkConnectGrpcException: (org.apache.spark.sql.connect.common.InvalidPlanInput) No DataFrame with id a4efa660-897c-4500-bd4e-bd57cd0263d2 is found in the session cd4764b4-90a9-4249-9140-12a6e4a98cd3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the main change has not been released out yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, and added a unittest.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCreate a new error class START_OFFSET_DOES_NOT_MATCH_ASSIGNED. When partition mismatch is found in KafkaOffsetReader between start offsets and assigned partitions, throw this exception.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn KafkaOffsetReader, we assert startOffsets have the same topic partition list as assigned. However, if the user changes topic partition while the query is running, they will see the assertion. Instead, they should see an exception.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a new unit test in KafkaOffsetReaderSuite to make sure the exception case is thrown correctly.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-21T22:56:52Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T03:54:23Z","closed_at":"2024-06-03T03:54:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"26459546c9a81717e966e9f5c1d535bfe9beee88","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis simple PR adds a parameter `batchSize` to the underlying `javaToPython` function.  This parameter is already available on `pairRDDToPython`.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWith this, pyspark program can decide to use a different batch size when the default AutoBatchPickler ends up with 2GB exceeded error as in the JIRA ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48380\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis introduces a new way to access python RDD from python DataFrame:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# python\r\n# The existing way to convert dataframe to RDD with auto batching (NO CHANGES)\r\ndf.rdd\r\n# The new way to convert dataframe to RDD with batchSize of 1 (New API)\r\ndf._jdf.javaToPython(1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmvn test\r\n(still testing)\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-05-21T18:57:12Z","updated_at":"2024-05-22T03:51:07Z","closed_at":"2024-05-22T03:51:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3e63c60336a18911514377ff088d380827bc4fcc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46691/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46691/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46691/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2a2f070c4b9c668c676d6a6f10f81a9c7840ded6","head":{"label":"zshao9:dev/zshao/SPARK-48380","ref":"dev/zshao/SPARK-48380","sha":"2a2f070c4b9c668c676d6a6f10f81a9c7840ded6","user":{"login":"zshao9","id":150957854,"node_id":"U_kgDOCP9vHg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150957854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9","html_url":"https://github.com/zshao9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":803995593,"node_id":"R_kgDOL-v_yQ","name":"spark","full_name":"zshao9/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zshao9","id":150957854,"node_id":"U_kgDOCP9vHg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150957854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9","html_url":"https://github.com/zshao9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshao9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zshao9/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUsers will no longer get an error if they pass a length-1 list or tuple of StructType as the schema argument to createDataFrame()\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn Python code it is easy to accidentally create a length-1 tuple of `StructType` instead of just a `StructType` if you leave a trailing comma at the end of a line.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt prevents an unhelpful error message in this case.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI modified one of the existing tests to test this.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-05-21T13:11:17Z","updated_at":"2024-05-22T10:58:57Z","closed_at":"2024-05-22T10:58:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e1af17ede41c1cfa9c3da126fc8f9139f535e7f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46687/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46687/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46687/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/62af1ee8a1962ecc38ab1037a8a5def3eb8a3c56","head":{"label":"ianmcook:SPARK-48373","ref":"SPARK-48373","sha":"62af1ee8a1962ecc38ab1037a8a5def3eb8a3c56","user":{"login":"ianmcook","id":280509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook","html_url":"https://github.com/ianmcook","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":771149486,"node_id":"R_kgDOLfbOrg","name":"spark","full_name":"ianmcook/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ianmcook","id":280509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook","html_url":"https://github.com/ianmcook","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ianmcook/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr is following up https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46679.\r\nThe pr aims to replace `keywords` (from `Requires formatting` to `Unformatted files found`) that identify `lint-scala` detection results.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAccording to the discussion and analysis of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46679#issuecomment-2122142979, with the upgrade of `org.antipathy:mvn-scalafmt_*` version, it seems more general to use `Unformatted files found` as the keyword, because it directly comes from `the prompt of error level output`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Manually test\r\n```\r\n(base) ➜  spark-community git:(SPARK-48367_FOLLOWUP) ✗ dev/lint-scala\r\nScalastyle checks passed.\r\nScalafmt checks passed.\r\n```\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nString searching in UTF8_BINARY_LCASE now works on character-level, rather than on byte-level. For example: `replace(\"İ\", \"i\")`; now returns \"İ\", because there exists no `start, len` such that `lowercase(substring(\"İ\", start, len)) == \"i\"`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix functions that give unusable results due to one-to-many case mapping when performing string search under UTF8_BINARY_LCASE (see example above).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, behaviour of `replace` expression is changed for edge cases with one-to-many case mapping.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests for StringReplace and FindInSet in `CollationSupportSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-21T09:41:00Z","updated_at":"2024-06-28T01:06:14Z","closed_at":"2024-06-28T01:06:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"af4c19d46603b2552c9f40e270fe072a5bf18761","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46682/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46682/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46682/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4f3fd2d27f7e32a264dc5f14315b9dc8763313cf","head":{"label":"uros-db:alter-lcase-vol3","ref":"alter-lcase-vol3","sha":"4f3fd2d27f7e32a264dc5f14315b9dc8763313cf","user":{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":755209418,"node_id":"R_kgDOLQOUyg","name":"spark","full_name":"uros-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to enable `spark.sql.sources.v2.bucketing.pushPartValues.enabled` by default for Apache Spark 4.0.0 while keeping `spark.sql.sources.v2.bucketing.enabled` is `false`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`spark.sql.sources.v2.bucketing.pushPartValues.enabled` was added at Apache Spark 3.4.0 and has been used as one of the datasource v2 bucketing feature. This PR will help the datasource v2 bucketing users use this feature more easily. \r\n\r\nNote that this change is technically no-op for the default users because `spark.sql.sources.v2.bucketing.enabled` is `false` still.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSome users are using UDFs for Zstd compression and decompression, which results in poor performance. If we provide native functions, the performance will be improved by compressing and decompressing just within the JVM.\r\n\r\nNow, we are introducing three new built-in functions:\r\n\r\n```\r\nzstd_compress(input: binary [, level: int [, steaming_mode: bool]])\r\n\r\nzstd_decompress(input: binary)\r\n\r\ntry_zstd_decompress(input: binary)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n* `input`: The binary value to compress or decompress.\r\n* `level`: Optional integer argument that represents the compression level. The compression level controls the trade-off between compression speed and compression ratio. The default level is 3. Valid values: between 1 and 22 inclusive\r\n* `streaming_mode`: Optional boolean argument that represents whether to use streaming mode to compress. \r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> SELECT base64(zstd_compress(repeat(\"Apache Spark \", 10)));\r\n  KLUv/SCCpQAAaEFwYWNoZSBTcGFyayABABLS+QU=\r\n> SELECT base64(zstd_compress(repeat(\"Apache Spark \", 10), 3, true));\r\n  KLUv/QBYpAAAaEFwYWNoZSBTcGFyayABABLS+QUBAAA=\r\n> SELECT string(zstd_decompress(unbase64(\"KLUv/SCCpQAAaEFwYWNoZSBTcGFyayABABLS+QU=\")));\r\n  Apache Spark Apache Spark Apache Spark Apache Spark Apache Spark Apache Spark Apache Spark Apache Spark Apache Spark Apache Spark\r\n> SELECT zstd_decompress(zstd_compress(\"Apache Spark\"));\r\n  Apache Spark\r\n> SELECT try_zstd_decompress(\"invalid input\")\r\n  NULL\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese three built-in functions are also available in Python and Scala.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUsers no longer need to use UDFs for Zstd compression and decompression; they can directly use built-in SQL functions to run within the JVM.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, three SQL functions - `zstd_compress`, `zstd_decompress`, and `try_zstd_decompress` are introduced.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UT and E2E tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI am proposing additional optimizer rules for conditionals (`If` and `CaseWhen` expressions) whose branches are themselves predicates. These could be written as Boolean logic and would thus allow filters containing such expressions to be pushed to a data source. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe primary motivation is to allow filters to be pushed and thus potentially handled by a datasource.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests have been added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

cast that are supported on spark, are not supported on external database.\r\nFor example, spark supports casting from float to timestamp, but many other databases does not support that.\r\n\r\nAdd new cast suite that can be reused by any connector (even non JDBC connectors)\r\nAdd suites for MySQL and Postgres.\r\nFix found issues for MySQL, Postgres and Snowflake.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo avoid exception because illegal cast was tried on remote data source.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, type mapping is a little bit changed for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `QueryTest` to no longer depend on `RemoteSparkSession`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis allows the tests for Spark Connect plugin to provide their version of `RemoteSparkSession` (which depends on some idiosyncrasies of how Spark is built).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests to ensure that nothing breaks. Manually tested that this allows a plugin to use `QueryTest`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes changes to SQL parser to introduce support for SQL scripting statements:\r\n- Introduces `BEGIN` keyword to the lexer.\r\n- Changes grammar to support compound statements.\r\n- Exposes new `parseScript` method in `ParserInterface`.\r\n- Implements visitor functions for new nodes in the syntax tree in `AstBuilder`.\r\n- Introduces new logical operators in `SqlScriptingLogicalOperators` for compound statements that are created by visiting functions and that will be used during interpretation phase.\r\n\r\nIn order to simplify the process, in this PR we only introduce the support for compound statements to the SQL parser.\r\nFollow-up PRs will introduce interpreter, further statements, support for exceptions thrown from parser/interpreter, etc.\r\nMore details can be found in [Jira item](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48342) for this task and its parent (where the design doc is uploaded as well).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe intent is to add support for SQL scripting (and stored procedures down the line). It gives users the ability to develop complex logic and ETL entirely in SQL.\r\n\r\nUntil now, users had to write verbose SQL statements or combine SQL + Python to efficiently write the logic. This is an effort to breach that gap and enable complex logic to be written entirely in SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\nThis PR is a first in series of PRs that will introduce changes to `sql()` API to add support for SQL scripting, but for now, the API remains unchanged.\r\nIn the future, the API will remain the same as well, but it will have new possibility to execute SQL scripts.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThere are tests in `SqlScriptingParserSuite` that test the newly introduced parser changes.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-05-20T10:34:30Z","updated_at":"2024-06-18T07:55:35Z","closed_at":"2024-06-18T07:55:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b3dd0b904c0c0b731e2d5c2884305b6bd93ac97c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46665/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46665/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46665/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/53666a11a56ab8689ad9b3b6eb2be7e303a44f16","head":{"label":"davidm-db:sql_batch_parser","ref":"sql_batch_parser","sha":"53666a11a56ab8689ad9b3b6eb2be7e303a44f16","user":{"login":"davidm-db","id":163021185,"node_id":"U_kgDOCbeBgQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163021185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db","html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":775065390,"node_id":"R_kgDOLjKPLg","name":"spark","full_name":"davidm-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davidm-db","id":163021185,"node_id":"U_kgDOCbeBgQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163021185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db","html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db/spark","description":"Apache

this pull request?\r\nFollowing up on the introduction of AbstractMapType (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46458) and changes that introduce collation awareness for RaiseError expression (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46461), this PR should add the appropriate type casting rules for AbstractMapType.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix the CI failure for the `Support RaiseError misc expression with collation` test when ANSI is off.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, type casting is now allowed for map types with collated strings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExtended suite `CollationSQLExpressionsANSIOffSuite` with ANSI disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-20T07:53:52Z","updated_at":"2024-05-22T12:24:45Z","closed_at":"2024-05-22T12:21:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"30e574469cd0c2992fa90c8c5e2e028272740df3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46661/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46661/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46661/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d3938600cd6a08beea3f38b0fc371140fbd2ae57","head":{"label":"uros-db:fix-abstract-map","ref":"fix-abstract-map","sha":"d3938600cd6a08beea3f38b0fc371140fbd2ae57","user":{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":755209418,"node_id":"R_kgDOLQOUyg","name":"spark","full_name":"uros-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db/spark","description":"Apache
