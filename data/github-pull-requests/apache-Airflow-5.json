#45966 \r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate: Modifying the description only for create API and simplifying use case.\r\n\r\nThe XCom creation API fills a critical gap by enabling dynamic updates to workflows.\r\nCurrent XComs are tied to task execution, limiting flexibility for long-running workflows.\r\nThe API allows dynamic creation of XCom values during execution, This is needed mostly for the use case of fixing manually recover from problems with workflows.\r\nAvoid placeholder tasks just to generate XComs.\r\n\r\nWe will also have the edit XCom API as part of #45966 coming soon.

Add the following Dag.\r\n\r\n_This Airflow DAG demonstrates how to use XComs for passing data between tasks. The first task (wait_and_not_push) waits for 1 minute but does not push any XCom. The second task (pull_and_print) attempts to pull an XCom value with the key outbound_key1 from the first task, logs it if found, or warns if absent._\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.providers.standard.operators.python import PythonOperator\r\nimport time\r\nimport logging\r\nimport pendulum\r\n\r\n# Default arguments for the DAG\r\ndefault_args = {\r\n    'owner': 'airflow',\r\n    'retries': 1\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Initialize the DAG\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"xcom_pull_example_dag\",\r\n    default_args=default_args,\r\n    description=\"A DAG demonstrating XCom pull with key 'outbound_key1'\",\r\n    start_date=pendulum.datetime(2025, 1, 1, tz=\"UTC\"),\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n    tags=[\"xcom\", \"example\"],\r\n) as dag:\r\n\r\n    def wait_and_not_push_xcom(**kwargs):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Task to wait for 1 minute.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        logging.info(\"Waiting for 1 minute...\")\r\n        time.sleep(60)  # Wait for 1 minute\r\n\r\n    def pull_and_print_xcom(**kwargs):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Task to pull an XCom entry with key 'outbound_key1' and print its value.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        ti = kwargs[\"ti\"]\r\n        xcom_value = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids=\"wait_and_not_push\", key=\"outbound_key1\")\r\n\r\n        if xcom_value:\r\n            logging.info(f\"Retrieved XCom value for key 'outbound_key1': {xcom_value}\")\r\n        else:\r\n            logging.warning(\"No XCom value found for key 'outbound_key1'!\")\r\n\r\n    # First task: Wait for 1 minute\r\n    wait_and_not_push = PythonOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"wait_and_not_push\",\r\n        python_callable=wait_and_not_push_xcom\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    # Second task: Pull the XCom entry and print its value\r\n    pull_and_print = PythonOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"pull_and_print\",\r\n        python_callable=pull_and_print_xcom\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    # Define the task dependencies\r\n    wait_and_not_push >> pull_and_print\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.

pull request introduces the following updates to the `XCom` and `XComEntry `components, improving the functionality and user experience when viewing XCom entries within a DAG run:\r\n\r\n### Changes Made:\r\n1.` XComEntry.tsx:`\r\n\r\n- Error Handling: Added error handling to display error messages when the XCom value fetch fails.\r\n- Clipboard Copy Feedback: Implemented a toast notification that alerts the user when an XCom value has been successfully copied to the clipboard.\r\n- Loading Skeleton: Added a loading skeleton that appears while the XCom value is being fetched.\r\n- Fallback for Missing Data: Displayed a fallback message (\"No XCom data available\") when no value is present for a given XCom entry.\r\n\r\n2. `XCom.tsx:`\r\n\r\n- Pagination Handling: Integrated pagination functionality to fetch and display paginated XCom entries for the selected DAG run and task.\r\n- Error Alert: Added an `ErrorAlert `component to handle and display any errors that occur during the XCom entries fetch.\r\n- Table State Management: Enhanced the state management of the table (pagination, sorting) via `useTableURLState`, ensuring consistency when navigating between pages.\r\n- `DataTable` Integration: Updated the `DataTable` component to display XCom entries with appropriate loading and pagination states.\r\n\r\n### Why this is needed:\r\n\r\n- **Error Handling**: To ensure users are informed when data fetching fails.\r\n- **Clipboard Copying**: To provide an easy way for users to copy XCom values to their clipboard for further use.\r\n- **UI/UX Improvement**: To improve the user experience with skeleton loaders and toast notifications, providing visual cues for ongoing actions.","created_at":"2025-01-25T15:28:19Z","updated_at":"2025-01-26T04:16:51Z","closed_at":"2025-01-25T20:44:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2ca70950f2229c6e4006cab01d10ce6a0fa9321f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jscheffl","id":95105677,"node_id":"U_kgDOBasyjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95105677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl","html_url":"https://github.com/jscheffl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related

big change here (other than just moving code around) is to introduce a\r\nconceptual separation between Definition/Execution time and Scheduler time.\r\n\r\nThis means that the expansion of tasks (creating the TaskInstance rows with\r\ndifferent map_index values) is now done on the scheduler, and we now\r\ndeserialize to different classes. For example, when we deserialize the\r\n`DictOfListsExpandInput` it gets turned into an instance of\r\nSchedulerDictOfListsExpandInput. This is primarily designed so that DB access\r\nis kept 100% out of the TaskSDK.\r\n\r\nSome of the changes here are on the \"wat\" side of the scale, and this is\r\nmostly designed to not break 100% of our tests, and we have #45549 to look at\r\nthat more holistically.\r\n\r\nTo support the \"reduce\" style task which takes as input a sequence of all the\r\npushed (mapped) XCom values, and to keep the previous behaviour of not loading\r\nall values in to memory at once, we have added a new HEAD route to the Task\r\nExecution interface that returns the number of mapped XCom values so that it\r\nis possible to implement `__len__` on the new LazyXComSequence class.\r\n\r\nI have deleted a tranche of tests from tests/models that were to do with\r\nruntime behavoir and and now tested in the TaskSDK instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing:\r\n\r\nI have been testing this with Celery Executor and the example_dynamic_task_mapping dag, which is this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith DAG(dag_id=\"example_dynamic_task_mapping\", schedule=None, start_date=datetime(2022, 3, 4)) as dag:\r\n    @task\r\n    def add_one(x: int):\r\n        return x + 1\r\n\r\n    @task\r\n    def sum_it(values):\r\n        total = sum(values)\r\n        print(f\"Total was {total}\")\r\n\r\n    added_values = add_one.expand(x=[1, 2, 3])\r\n    sum_it(added_values)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt now works, and the sum_it tasks logs show:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"timestamp\":\"2025-02-04T14:24:05.264679Z\",\"level\":\"info\",\"event\":\"Total was 9\",\"chan\":\"stdout\",\"logger\":\"task\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCloses #44360\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

this wasn't a problem before, having `ti.run` in the dagrun tests makes\nporting code to the TaskSDK much more complicated. It also arguably makes them\nmore of integration tests than unit tests, which is no bad thing in and of\nitself, but `ti.run()` can't work on SerializedDAG, so it means that the tests\nare not quite representative of what the Scheduler will actually be doing.\n\nMost of this change is to swap from calling run to setting the state (and\nsometimes adding a TaskMap row) and then checking the scheduling decisions\nresult.\n\nI have added the need_serialized_dag marker to the tests I touched. In the\nnext PR I create (that I extracted this out of) I apply this marker to all the\nentire file, but that also needs porting manny of the dynamic task mapping\ntests, and since I will be moving those soon I didn't touch them here too.\n\nThe test_prev_dagrun_dep file has been removed as it was only used in two\nspecific tests in this file, so it's better to inline it directly there.\n\nHow is this change deleting so many files? By removing duplicated or\nalmost-duplicated tests, namely these pairs. There were too many tests that\nhad almost identical bodies.\n\nFor example, testing that reducing a map length to zero isn't noticably\ndifferent to testing that a map length reduces by 2.\n\n<!--\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n or more contributor license agreements.

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\ncloses: #45969\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nTasks can be defined with inlet and outlet events in it definition. For cases when `inactive` assets are defined either in inlets, outlets or both, `_validate_inlet_outlet_assets_activeness` is a function defined that checks for this scenario and fails those tasks. This was added as part of https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/44600.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour needs to be ported into the task sdk to maintain synchronisation with the legacy DAGs written prior to Airflow 3.\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\n\r\nThis was done like this earlier: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/4cab641fbe00601ac736f19f4a56adbcc7848e1b/airflow/models/taskinstance.py#L3718-L3729.\r\n\r\n- The function gets all the unique keys of all the possible assets defined in a conjunction of inlets + outlets of the task\r\n- Once this is retrieved, the `AssetUniqueKey` is constructed for above\r\n- We define another function that gets the inactive keys by querying the database: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/4cab641fbe00601ac736f19f4a56adbcc7848e1b/airflow/models/taskinstance.py#L3732\r\n- If any inactive assets, raise an exception.\r\n\r\nChallenge with doing similar things for task sdk:\r\n1. `inlets` and `outlets` are runtime parameters for tasks, so we can only get them at runtime.\r\n2. These need to be sent to the execution API server, which can make a decision whether these validation succeed or not.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, these lead to two possible approaches:\r\n\r\n### Approach 1: Performing these checks while starting a `task` ie. in the `/run` endpoint.\r\nThis seemed like the most natural approach but there were a few challenges around here.\r\n\r\nThis is our start() in supervisor:\r\n```\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def start(  # type: ignore[override]\r\n        cls,\r\n        *,\r\n        what: TaskInstance,\r\n        dag_rel_path: str | os.PathLike[str],\r\n        bundle_info,\r\n        client: Client,\r\n        target: Callable[[], None] = _subprocess_main,\r\n        logger: FilteringBoundLogger | None = None,\r\n        **kwargs,\r\n    ) -> Self:\r\n        \"\"\"Fork and start a new subprocess to execute the given task.\"\"\"\r\n        proc: Self = super().start(id=what.id, client=client, target=target, logger=logger, **kwargs)\r\n        # Tell the task process what it needs to do!\r\n        proc._on_child_started(ti=what, dag_rel_path=dag_rel_path, bundle_info=bundle_info)\r\n        return proc\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe do super().start which starts the child process's entrypoint / target but it doesnt run it until a startup is recveived. And in _on_child_started , we do this:\r\n```\r\n    def _on_child_started(self, ti: TaskInstance, dag_rel_path: str | os.PathLike[str], bundle_info):\r\n        \"\"\"Send startup message to the subprocess.\"\"\"\r\n        try:\r\n            # We've forked, but the task won't start doing anything until we send it the StartupDetails\r\n            # message. But before we do that, we need to tell the server it's started (so it has the chance to\r\n            # tell us \"no, stop!\" for any reason)\r\n            ti_context = self.client.task_instances.start(ti.id, self.pid, datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc))\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n        msg = StartupDetails.model_construct(\r\n            ti=ti,\r\n            dag_rel_path=os.fspath(dag_rel_path),\r\n            bundle_info=bundle_info,\r\n            requests_fd=self._requests_fd,\r\n            ti_context=ti_context,\r\n        )\r\n\r\n        # Send the message to tell the process what it needs to execute\r\n        log.debug(\"Sending\", msg=msg)\r\n\r\n        try:\r\n            self.stdin.write(msg.model_dump_json().encode())\r\n            self.stdin.write(b\"\\n\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe tell the server to `self.client.task_instances.start` and then send the startup message to the task runner when it actually starts.\r\n\r\nThe option would be to send the task outlets and inlets (defined as ti.task.inlets or ti.task.outlets) to the execution API. Challenge that makes it hard is that the ti_context comes from the run endpoint and we need that for startup details.\r\n\r\nMaybe this can be a later optimisation with fewer network calls but require good amount of refactoring, so parking for now.\r\n\r\n### Approach 2: Introduce a new endpoint at the execution API that can perform runtime checks and is called after startup and during run from task runner.\r\n\r\n- Introduced a new endpoint: `/{task_instance_id}/runtime-checks`. Generic endpoint that can perform runtime checks for a TI. Right now limited to `_validate_inlet_outlet_assets_activeness` but easily extendable. Returns 200 if all ok, 204 if not applicable and 400 for failed checks.\r\n- Called from task runner after the task has been fetched: `ti.task = ti.task.prepare_for_execution()` through the supervisor and the client.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details:\r\n\r\n### Execution API Server\r\n- New API: `runtime_checks` introduced on task instance, right now limited to checking behaviour assosiated with `_validate_inlet_outlet_assets_activeness` but can be extended.\r\n- Returns 200 if all ok with (`{\"message\": \"Runtime checks passed successfully.\"}`), 204 if not applicable and 400 for failed checks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Client side\r\n\r\n#### Comms\r\n- `RuntimeCheckOnTask` payload introduced, this one is an extension of payload:\r\n```\r\nclass TIRuntimeCheckPayload(BaseModel):\r\n    \"\"\"Payload for performing Runtime checks on the TaskInstance model as requested by the SDK.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n    inlet: list[AssetProfile] | None = None\r\n    outlet: list[AssetProfile] | None = None\r\n```\r\n- The response from the server is translated to a simple `OKresponse`: `True` indicates that runtime checks passed from server, `False` is otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### HTTP Client\r\n- Simple POST call to the server API: `self.client.post(f\"task-instances/{id}/runtime-checks\", content=body.model_dump_json())` and translates the response to `OKResponse`\r\n- For a non 400 status code in failure, raises exception.\r\n\r\n#### Task Runner\r\n- Right after preparation for execution of a task, we check if inlets or outlets are defined on a task, if yes, construct the structure to call the API and send it to the supervisor.\r\n- If supervisor returns a message indicating the runtime checks didnt pass on server, fail the task.\r\n\r\n#### Supervisor\r\n```\r\n        elif isinstance(msg, RuntimeCheckOnTask):\r\n            runtime_check_resp = self.client.task_instances.runtime_checks(id=self.id, msg=msg)\r\n            resp = runtime_check_resp.model_dump_json().encode()\r\n            if not runtime_check_resp.ok:\r\n                log.debug(\"Runtime checks failed on task %s, marking task as failed..\", self.id)\r\n                self.client.task_instances.finish(\r\n                    id=self.id, state=TerminalTIState.FAILED, when=datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc)\r\n                )\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Calls the runtime checks API, if the response is not OK, immediately calls the `finish` endpoint with failed state.\r\n- This optimises the flow as much as possible by having no need to communicate with the task runner.\r\n\r\n#### Models/taskinstance.py\r\n- Modified the `_validate_inlet_outlet_assets_activeness` to a structure that can accomodate the task sdk.\r\n```\r\nvalidate_inlet_outlet_assets_activeness(\r\n        inlets: list[AssetProfile], outlets: list[AssetProfile], session: Session\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe signature now accepts the inlets and outlets directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing results\r\nDAG defined:\r\n```\r\nfrom airflow.models.dag import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.empty import EmptyOperator\r\nfrom airflow.sdk.definitions.asset import Asset\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"asset_dag\",\r\n    start_date=None,\r\n    schedule=None,\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n):\r\n\r\n    outlet = EmptyOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"outlet\",\r\n        outlets=[Asset(name=\"outlet\", uri=\"something-uri\"), Asset(name=\"outlet-new-name\", uri=\"something-uri\")],\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    inlet = EmptyOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"inlet\",\r\n        outlets=[Asset(name=\"outlet\", uri=\"something-uri\"), Asset(name=\"outlet-new-name\", uri=\"something-uri\")],\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    outlet >> inlet\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue with the DAG is that the same assets are present in the outlets and inlets and changed name with same URI. Hence once of them is inactive in `outlets`\r\n\r\n#### Legacy\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2e614dc-cfda-4b2b-8e60-bdc0ca9e33e7)\r\n\r\nLogs:\r\n```\r\nbe976385dc7e\r\n ▶ Log message source details\r\n[2025-01-27, 09:19:41 UTC] {local_task_job_runner.py:120} ▼ Pre task execution logs\r\n[2025-01-27, 09:19:41 UTC] {taskinstance.py:2384} INFO - Dependencies all met for dep_context=non-requeueable deps ti=<TaskInstance: asset_dag.outlet manual__2025-01-27T09:19:35.134947+00:00 [queued]>\r\n[2025-01-27, 09:19:41 UTC] {taskinstance.py:2384} INFO - Dependencies all met for dep_context=requeueable deps ti=<TaskInstance: asset_dag.outlet manual__2025-01-27T09:19:35.134947+00:00 [queued]>\r\n[2025-01-27, 09:19:41 UTC] {taskinstance.py:2625} INFO - Starting attempt 1 of 1\r\n[2025-01-27, 09:19:41 UTC] {taskinstance.py:2648} INFO - Executing <Task(EmptyOperator): outlet> on 2025-01-27 09:19:35.134947+00:00\r\n[2025-01-27, 09:19:41 UTC] {standard_task_runner.py:131} INFO - Started process 557 to run task\r\n[2025-01-27, 09:19:41 UTC] {standard_task_runner.py:147} INFO - Running: ['***', 'tasks', 'run', 'asset_dag', 'outlet', 'manual__2025-01-27T09:19:35.134947+00:00', '--raw', '--subdir', 'DAGS_FOLDER/producer_and_consumer.py', '--cfg-path', '/tmp/tmpocu3qfya']\r\n[2025-01-27, 09:19:41 UTC] {standard_task_runner.py:148} INFO - Subtask outlet\r\n[2025-01-27, 09:19:41 UTC] {task_command.py:474} INFO - Running <TaskInstance: asset_dag.outlet manual__2025-01-27T09:19:35.134947+00:00 [running]> on host be976385dc7e\r\n[2025-01-27, 09:19:41 UTC] {taskinstance.py:3119} ERROR - Task failed with exception\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/opt/airflow/airflow/models/taskinstance.py\", line 274, in _run_raw_task\r\n    TaskInstance.validate_inlet_outlet_assets_activeness(inlets, outlets, session=session)\r\n  File \"/opt/airflow/airflow/models/taskinstance.py\", line 3744, in validate_inlet_outlet_assets_activeness\r\n    raise AirflowInactiveAssetInInletOrOutletException(inactive_asset_unique_keys)\r\nairflow.exceptions.AirflowInactiveAssetInInletOrOutletException: Task has the following inactive assets in its inlets or outlets: Asset(name=\"outlet-new-name\", uri=\"something-uri\")\r\n[2025-01-27, 09:19:41 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1130} INFO - Immediate failure requested.

What it does\r\nSimilarly to the `POST backfills` in dry_run mode. This adds a dry_run mode endpoint for the patch task instances and patch  mapped task instances. Removed the `dry_run` param of the default patch TI and mapped TI endpoint, because it was only affecting the `state`, still mutating the note, which is a little bit weird.\r\n\r\n## Why\r\nWhile working on the front-end to mark task instances as success or failed, I realized that there wasn't a way to see affected task instances for a specific set state with settings (past / future / etc...). Legacy front-end was relying on a custom UI endpoint `/confirm`, I don't think we need yet another private endpoint to handle this, I think any user can be intersted before setting a task_state to something to see side effects on other affected tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe could also just improve the existing patch endpoint to fully support a dry_run mode, but for the same reasons as we did for backfill, different endpoint is just clearer. (Same endpoint would have different return type based on the `dry_run` value. `dry_run: False`  would return a TI, but `dry_run: True` would return a list of affected tasks. That's confusing on the client side, and force manual casting or overloading. Also code path for dry_run and non dry_run would be intertwined in the same endpoint making it even more complex).","created_at":"2025-01-24T16:42:06Z","updated_at":"2025-01-28T10:22:39Z","closed_at":"2025-01-28T10:22:37Z","merged_at":"2025-01-28T10:22:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"825df6db600fd3ba81f708e60c12be8e2b515a2f","assignee":{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jscheffl","id":95105677,"node_id":"U_kgDOBasyjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95105677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl","html_url":"https://github.com/jscheffl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbud

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR enables the task.scheduled_duration metric.  It is already described here:\r\nhttps://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/administration-and-deployment/logging-monitoring/metrics.html#timers\r\nSearch for \"task.scheduled_duration\"\r\nThe metric is not working at the moment as the scheduled_dttm field is missing in the task_instance table.\r\n\r\nI hope I catched all points in the code were the task_instance is set to scheduled state to collect the right time and that I understood the metric in the right way.\r\nIdea of this PR to keep it as simple as possible to enable this metric.\r\n\r\n# Details of changes:\r\n* Add scheduled_dttm field to the task_instance table.\r\n* Setting scheduled_dttm field if task is set to scheduled state.\r\n* Enable metric calcuation.\r\n* Update the api to

were a number of issues with clearing a run or task:\r\n\r\n- we were calling PATCH run/task to update the note even if the note didnt change\r\n- we were calling dry run when the button mounted even if the modal was never opened, which on the table of task instances could be 25 different API calls\r\n- we weren't caching any of the dry_runs so we needed a new request any time the user toggled any options\r\n\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n- check if the note has changed before adding that mutation\r\n- Make custom hooks to turn the dry run mutations into queries which we can cache\r\n- Pass `enabled: open` to only run the query when the modal is active\r\n- react query allows us to cache dry run results\r\n- Removed `useEffect` which is usually a bad practice\r\n- Also default the accordions to show the affected tasks because thats more relevant for most users\r\n- Updated DataTable to not show pagination when totalEntries === # of rows and the page would only ever be 1\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more

one also adds some missing steps in provider migration script. improves the output and instructions and make it more robust for various variations of provider features and usage of

In maintenance mode, the worker is alive, but cannot consume any jobs.\r\nThe maintenance mode can be triggered by a button from the edge worker status page. It writes the state \"maintenance request\" directly to the database as worker state. Then the worker will go to maintenance pending if there are running jobs, and maintenance mode if all jobs have finished.\r\n\r\nWhen exiting maintenance mode, maintenance exit is written to the database. Then the worker will switch to running state if it was in state maintenance pending, and to idle if it was in maintenance mode.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47c2b5f4-7f67-40b9-b5f9-0540898fb318)\r\n\r\nWhy do we need the state maintenance exit?\r\nIf the user requested maintenance, so the

testing \"standard\" provider move to the new structure it turned out, that \"providers\" package used now to keep tests in the new providers is problematic - while it solves the ambiguity of \"from celery import\", it introduces another ambiguity when trying to import internal utility classes in tests. For example when trying to import BasePythonTest in standard operatori currently we refer to the import from root directory of Airflow::\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom providers.tests.standard.operators.test_python\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if we change the package structure to have `providers` as subpackage of `tests` and trying to import it from `tests` as root folder to tests, we have:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom providers.standard.operators.test_python\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it can ambiguously attempt to import\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom airflow.providers.standard.operators.test_python\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis confuses IDEs and attempts to run multiple tests together, because pytest modifies PYTHONPATH while running tests - and PYTHONPATH modification can be different, depending on which tests are selected to run.\r\n\r\nChanging the sub-package to provider_tests makes it unambiguous and we can now import:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom provider_tests.standard.operators.test_python\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is unambiguous and allows to import the tests inside the provider package, without importing from root of Airlfow package - making provider package tests \"standalone\" inside provider.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

of the uses cases of `send_request` are also followed by `get_message` --\nso lets do that for users -- this makes it closer to an HTTP request too,\nwhere you send a request and get a request.\n\nSome message types don't have a response, so in order to know if we should\ncall `get_message` or not we define a \"marker\" class of `NoResponseMessage`,\nand if we subclass that then we don't expect, and don't read anything back.\n\nThe other option I considered was to have the supervisor always send a message\nback (i.e. send an empty line when there is otherwise no response to send) and\nhave `get_message()` typed to be `ToTask | None`. It felt marginally better to\nhave `get_message()` typed and behave to always expect a messsage.\n\n<!--\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n or more contributor license agreements.

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\ncloses: #45752\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nWhen a task completed (moves into success) state, asset related events for that particular task should be stores into the metadata DB. Currently it is done like this: [airflow/airflow/models/taskinstance.py](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/051e617e0d7d0ebb995cb98063709350f279963c/airflow/models/taskinstance.py#L359).\r\n\r\nThis does a few things:\r\n1. It extracts outlets from the task\r\n2. For every outlet and its asset events, it creates record in the database in various tables:\r\n`asset`\r\n`asset_alias`\r\n`asset_alias_asset`\r\n`asset_alias_asset_event`\r\n`asset_event`\r\n3. The support is not limited to Asset type only, it also works with AssetAliases and refs for Assets like name ref and uri ref.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour needs to be ported into the task sdk.\r\n\r\n### Approach\r\n\r\nThe idea is to implement this logic in the `patch` ti state endpoint in the execution API server. The reasoning is so that we needn't make an additional API call but when \"finishing\" a task from the task runner, we can send in the relevant details like the task outlets, the outlet events and take care of the rest in `ti_update_state` endpoint.\r\n\r\n#### Interface changes\r\n- We have a new payload: `TISuccessStatePayload` to mark a state as success from the task runner in the execution API -> reason being, we do not want to coagulate the `TITerminalStatePayload` with additional information slowing down the API request for no need.\r\n- The structure contains:\r\n`task_outlets`: translates to `ti.task.outlets` at execution time sent from the task runner\r\n`outlet_events`: these are the events for a `outlet` object. For example, for `Assets` it translates to `context[\"outlet_events\"][Asset Object]`\r\n`asset_type`: we send the type of object (class name) the exeuction API has to deal with. This is to avoid any additional mental gymnastics on the server side to find the kind of object we are dealing with as it will be serialised.\r\n\r\n#### Server Side\r\n- In the `ti_update_state` added an additional branch for success state where we call `register_asset_changes` which is a similar function to https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/051e617e0d7d0ebb995cb98063709350f279963c/airflow/models/taskinstance.py#L359 but adjusted for the execution API.\r\n- This function does a few things: for every `task_outlet`, it registers the events for different types:\r\n1. For Asset, it receives events from the task runner, so it just registers those.\r\n2. For AssetNameRef and AssetUriRef, it find the relevant Asset for those and registers the events.\r\n3. For AssetAlias, it creates a map of number of events to be registered on the basis of unique pairs of `tuple[asset uri, extra]`, and generates events for those by handling some cases. Docs: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/authoring-and-scheduling/datasets.html#how-to-use-datasetalias\r\n\r\n#### Execution side\r\n\r\n##### Task Runner\r\nThe task runner runs the task as usual and before finishing, checks for task outlets defined. If task outlets are defined, it populates the `task_outlets`, `outlet_events` and `asset_type` for the outlets present. \r\n\r\nFor `Asset`:\r\n1. Populates the `task_outlets` and `outlet_events` as `events[obj]` where `events = context[\"outlet_events\"]`\r\n\r\nFor `AssetNameRef` and `AssetUriRef`:\r\n1. Populates the `task_outlets` as needed and populates all the events possible as we cannot access the DB to get the model being referenced\r\n\r\nFor `AssetAlias`:\r\nWe dont care about the `task_outlets`, we only care about the `asset_alias_events`, so those are populated in `outlet_events`\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, a `SucceedTask` is sent to supervisor.\r\n\r\n##### Supervisor\r\nSupervisor starts treating the success state as `STATES_SENT_DIRECTLY` from now.

the auth manager is used both in the Flask application (Airflow 2 UI) and the Fastapi application (Airflow 3 UI). We introduced some methods in the interface that were needed for Airflow 3 use cases while keeping some that are only needed for Airflow 2.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the auth manager interface `base_auth_manager` should deprecate and not make abstract the methods only needed in Airflow 2. When Airflow 3 is released, if a user wants to implement a custom auth manager, they should not have to implement methods specific to Airflow 2.\r\n\r\nI deprecate them and not remove them because the auth manager is still used in Airflow 2. We will be able to delete them when the legacy UI is gone. Some other methods from the auth manager interface might be deprecated/deleted later but since they are not abstract, that will not be a breaking change. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

the current implementation of FileTrigger, the trigger fires and exits immediately upon detecting the file. This behavior works well in Airflow 2 because triggers are exclusively used for deferrable operators, which are designed to fire only once (as the trigger is deleted after firing).\r\n\r\nIn Airflow 3, however, triggers are also used to schedule DAGs based on events, and in this context, triggers are long-running, remaining active even after firing. For `FileTrigger`, this creates a scenario where multiple events can be sent simultaneously because the trigger exits immediately after detecting the file. Pausing before exiting gives some breathing room between checks (and potentially give some time for other system to delete the file to avoid other DAG executions).\r\n\r\nThis has no consequence for deferrable operators. The trigger will just leave `self.poke_interval` seconds more in the triggerer. Since it is an async operation, there is no harm.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR re-uses the Context dict from the Task SDK in `models/taskinstance.py`.\r\n\r\nOnce, CeleryExecutor & KubernetesExecutor are ported over to Task SDK, we can remove all of this code. This PR unifies some of that code.\r\n\nThis also uncovered flawed logic where a Task/TI is in running state but DagRun is in Queued or None state!!!\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
