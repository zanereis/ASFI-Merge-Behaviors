Description of PR\r\n\r\nThis enables auto-refreshing of the keystore and truststore configured in nifi.properties using Jetty's SSLContextFactory.reload(...) method.  This functionality is disabled by default, but can be configured using the following new properties in nifi.properties:\r\n\r\nnifi.security.autorefresh.enabled=true\r\nnifi.security.autorefresh.interval=10 secs\r\n\r\nIf enabled, the keystore and truststore files will be monitored at the refresh interval specified.  If any changes are detected in either one, a refresh of the SSLContextFactory is attempted, which essentially allows trusted certificates to be added to the trust store on the fly, or certificates to be updated in the keystore for expiration purposes.\r\n\r\nIf a reload is to be attempted, the code first performs a security check by verifying that there are no new aliases in the keystore, that the subject and issuer DN have not changed in the keystore, and if the issuer cert was provided in the certificate chain, that its serial number is the same as upon startup.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nThis adds a property \"Enable TLS\" to the RedisStateProvider (see state-management.xml for further documentation).  This allows a secured NiFi instance to use its own SSL context in the Redis connection provided by the RedisStateProvider.  If set to \"false\" (the default), an insecure Redis connection will be used, regardless of whether the NiFi instance is TLS-enabled itself.  If this property is set to \"true\" on an insecure NiFi instance, the state provider's validation will fail (since there is no SSL context to use), preventing the instance from starting up.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nAdding autogeneration of self-signed certificate in a default keystore/truststore when applicable.  Conditions for autogeneration are as follows:\r\n\r\n**nifi.properties contains the following configuration:**\r\n```\r\nnifi.web.https.port=<value> // Must be set\r\nnifi.security.keystore=<value> // Recommend testing with ./conf/keystore.p12\r\nnifi.security.truststore=<value> // Recommend testing with ./conf/truststore.p12\r\n```\r\nAdditionally, the keystore and truststore files as configured must not exist on the file system at those locations in order for them to be autogenerated.  The code will not attempt to generate these files if one or both of them is present in the configured locations. \r\n\r\n**The results will be:**\r\n\r\n- A self-signed certificate (CN=localhost) is generated with an expiration of 60 days.  The cert will be configured with Subject Alternative Names for the localhost hostname and address, as well as any values found in the following nifi.properties: nifi.remote.input.host, nifi.web.https.host, nifi.web.proxy.host, nifi.cluster.load.balance.address\r\n- A keystore containing the corresponding private key is placed at the path configured in nifi.security.keystore\r\n- A truststore containing the trusted certificate entry is placed at the path configured in nifi.security.truststore\r\n- Passwords generated with a secure random are used to protect the keystore/truststore\r\n- The following properties are populated appropriately in nifi.properties:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnifi.security.keystoreType=PKCS12\r\nnifi.security.keystorePassword=<generated password>\r\nnifi.security.keyPassword=<same as keystore password>\r\nnifi.security.truststoreType=PKCS12\r\nnifi.security.truststorePassword=<generated password>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-7468 Corrects an edge case with `SSLSocketChannelSender` where SSL Socket resources were being closed after the underlying socket resources were closed.  This does not appear to cause problems when using TLSv1.2, however, when using TLSv1.3 with `PutTCP` and configuring a connection per FlowFile, this can result in `java.io.IOException: Connection reset by peer` when interfacing with `ListenTCP`.  Closing SSL Socket resources allows for proper completion of the TLS handshake prior to closing the socket connection.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-5541 Adds a Maven build profile that can be used to generate an OWASP dependency vulnerability report using the OWASP dependency-check plugin.  The following Maven command can be used to generate `dependency-check-report.html` in the `target` directory:\r\n\r\n`mvn clean verify -P owasp`\r\n\r\nThe build profile also references a default suppression configuration that excludes warnings for Apache NiFi packages.  This suppression configuration is necessary since vulnerability analysis can produce false positives for NiFi packages that contain the names of other projects.\r\n\r\nAs noted in the build profile comments, results of this report require detailed analysis to determine whether the vulnerability impacts the application.  The purpose of this build profile and associated report is to provide contributors with an initial snapshot of potential issues for further investigation.  Report results do not necessarily imply actual vulnerabilities and upgrading dependencies requires careful usage evaluation.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-6714 Corrects OSUtils to use the `java.lang.Process` interface `pid()` method instead of the implementation class `pid()` method, which avoids illegal reflective access warnings during startup on Java 11, and allows NiFi to be started on Java 13.  The `getProcessId()` method retains the platform-specific logic to determine a child Process ID on macOS, Linux, and Windows for Java 8.  This update introduces a unit test for `getProcessId()` that succeeds on currently supported platforms, and also removes the unused `getJavaVersion()` method.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8363 Implements a Single User `LoginIdentityProvider` and `Authorizer` as an incremental step toward a default secure standalone installation of NiFi.  The `LoginIdentityProvider` class includes the following features:\r\n\r\n- Reads and writes username and hashed password in `login-identity-providers.xml`\r\n- Generates random username using `java.util.UUID.randomUUID()`\r\n- Generates random password of using `java.security.SecureRandom` with Base64 encoding\r\n- Writes generated password hash using bcrypt\r\n\r\nThe implementation is not intended for production use, but provides a basic level of security for standalone installations.  Future changes will incorporate updates to default configuration files so that this implementation can be reviewed independently.  Verifying runtime behavior requires the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Copy `login-identity-providers.xml` from the test resources directory to the NiFi `conf` directory\r\n2. Create an `authorizer` definition in `conf/authorizers.xml` with the following elements:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<authorizer>\r\n    <identifier>single-user-authorizer</identifier>\r\n    <class>org.apache.nifi.authorization.single.user.SingleUserAuthorizer</class>\r\n</authorizer>\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Set `nifi.security.user.login.identity.provider=single-user-provider` in `nifi.properties`\r\n4. Set `nifi.security.user.authorizer=single-user-authorizer` in `nifi.properties`\r\n5. Set `nifi.web.https.port` and `nifi.security` keystore and truststore properties to enable HTTPS\r\n6. Start NiFi and search `nifi-app.log` for `Generated Username` and `Generated Password`\r\n7. Login with NiFi using the generated credentials\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/guava-announce/zHZTFg7YF3o/rQNnwdHeEwAJ\">Guava types can no longer be sent over GWT-RPC.</a> To <em>temporarily</em> reenable support, set the <code>guava.gwt.emergency_reenable_rpc</code> system property to <code>true</code>. (5214a10b1e)\n<ul>\n<li>This is the only breaking change in this release, and it affects only users of the <code>guava-gwt</code> artifact, not people who use only the <code>guava</code> artifact. This release contains no changes that break <em>binary compatibility</em> for any users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>API documentation for Guava classes is now easier to reach. For example, for <code>ImmutableList</code>, visit <a href=\"https://guava.dev/ImmutableList\">guava.dev/ImmutableList</a>. Also, more easily access the index at <a href=\"https://guava.dev/api\">guava.dev/api</a>.</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Annotated <code>FluentIterable.from(FluentIterable)</code> with <code>@DoNotCall</code>. (b1c77b7df3)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made <code>ceiling</code>, <code>floor</code>, <code>headSet(E, boolean)</code>, and <code>tailSet(E, boolean)</code> methods available in the GWT-emulated <code>ImmutableSortedSet</code>. (7e0fe90ca8, 5f2fbf27b2)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Made it possible to set a stable incident edge order by calling the newly added method <code>[Value]Graph.Builder.incidentEdgeOrder(ElementOrder.stable())</code>. (70164025a8)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Added <code>incidentEdgeOrder()</code> to the <code>[Value]Graph</code> interfaces. (cde576ec00)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>Duration</code>-based <code>default</code> methods to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. (931e83f969)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>immediateVoidFuture</code>. (9f3bae5853)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Removed <code>@Beta</code> from <code>Service</code> and related classes. (dc46627fea)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the 1-arg overload of <code>ServiceManager.addListener</code>. (86e3620125)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed the return type of <code>ServiceManager.servicesByState()</code> to <code>ImmutableSetMultimap</code> (but also retained a method with the old signature for binary compatibility). (31999ae6f5)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Made it safe to load the <code>AbstractFuture</code> class from a <code>ForkJoinPool</code> thread under a security manager.

href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/guava-announce/zHZTFg7YF3o/rQNnwdHeEwAJ\">Guava types can no longer be sent over GWT-RPC.</a> To <em>temporarily</em> reenable support, set the <code>guava.gwt.emergency_reenable_rpc</code> system property to <code>true</code>. (5214a10b1e)\n<ul>\n<li>This is the only breaking change in this release, and it affects only users of the <code>guava-gwt</code> artifact, not people who use only the <code>guava</code> artifact. This release contains no changes that break <em>binary compatibility</em> for any users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>API documentation for Guava classes is now easier to reach. For example, for <code>ImmutableList</code>, visit <a href=\"https://guava.dev/ImmutableList\">guava.dev/ImmutableList</a>. Also, more easily access the index at <a href=\"https://guava.dev/api\">guava.dev/api</a>.</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Annotated <code>FluentIterable.from(FluentIterable)</code> with <code>@DoNotCall</code>. (b1c77b7df3)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made <code>ceiling</code>, <code>floor</code>, <code>headSet(E, boolean)</code>, and <code>tailSet(E, boolean)</code> methods available in the GWT-emulated <code>ImmutableSortedSet</code>. (7e0fe90ca8, 5f2fbf27b2)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Made it possible to set a stable incident edge order by calling the newly added method <code>[Value]Graph.Builder.incidentEdgeOrder(ElementOrder.stable())</code>. (70164025a8)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Added <code>incidentEdgeOrder()</code> to the <code>[Value]Graph</code> interfaces. (cde576ec00)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>Duration</code>-based <code>default</code> methods to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. (931e83f969)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>immediateVoidFuture</code>. (9f3bae5853)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Removed <code>@Beta</code> from <code>Service</code> and related classes. (dc46627fea)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the 1-arg overload of <code>ServiceManager.addListener</code>. (86e3620125)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed the return type of <code>ServiceManager.servicesByState()</code> to <code>ImmutableSetMultimap</code> (but also retained a method with the old signature for binary compatibility). (31999ae6f5)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Made it safe to load the <code>AbstractFuture</code> class from a <code>ForkJoinPool</code> thread under a security manager. (6e0c5b5d50)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>28.2</h2>\n<h3>Maven</h3>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.guava&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;guava&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;28.2-jre&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;!-- or, for Android: --&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;28.2-android&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/guava-announce/zHZTFg7YF3o/rQNnwdHeEwAJ\">Guava types can no longer be sent over GWT-RPC.</a> To <em>temporarily</em> reenable support, set the <code>guava.gwt.emergency_reenable_rpc</code> system property to <code>true</code>. (5214a10b1e)\n<ul>\n<li>This is the only breaking change in this release, and it affects only users of the <code>guava-gwt</code> artifact, not people who use only the <code>guava</code> artifact. This release contains no changes that break <em>binary compatibility</em> for any users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>API documentation for Guava classes is now easier to reach. For example, for <code>ImmutableList</code>, visit <a href=\"https://guava.dev/ImmutableList\">guava.dev/ImmutableList</a>. Also, more easily access the index at <a href=\"https://guava.dev/api\">guava.dev/api</a>.</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Annotated <code>FluentIterable.from(FluentIterable)</code> with <code>@DoNotCall</code>. (b1c77b7df3)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made <code>ceiling</code>, <code>floor</code>, <code>headSet(E, boolean)</code>, and <code>tailSet(E, boolean)</code> methods available in the GWT-emulated <code>ImmutableSortedSet</code>. (7e0fe90ca8, 5f2fbf27b2)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Made it possible to set a stable incident edge order by calling the newly added method <code>[Value]Graph.Builder.incidentEdgeOrder(ElementOrder.stable())</code>. (70164025a8)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Added <code>incidentEdgeOrder()</code> to the <code>[Value]Graph</code> interfaces. (cde576ec00)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>Duration</code>-based <code>default</code> methods to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. (931e83f969)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>immediateVoidFuture</code>. (9f3bae5853)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Removed <code>@Beta</code> from <code>Service</code> and related classes. (dc46627fea)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the 1-arg overload of <code>ServiceManager.addListener</code>. (86e3620125)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed the return type of <code>ServiceManager.servicesByState()</code> to <code>ImmutableSetMultimap</code> (but also retained a method with the old signature for binary compatibility). (31999ae6f5)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Made it safe to load the <code>AbstractFuture</code> class from a <code>ForkJoinPool</code> thread under a security manager.

href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/guava-announce/zHZTFg7YF3o/rQNnwdHeEwAJ\">Guava types can no longer be sent over GWT-RPC.</a> To <em>temporarily</em> reenable support, set the <code>guava.gwt.emergency_reenable_rpc</code> system property to <code>true</code>. (5214a10b1e)\n<ul>\n<li>This is the only breaking change in this release, and it affects only users of the <code>guava-gwt</code> artifact, not people who use only the <code>guava</code> artifact. This release contains no changes that break <em>binary compatibility</em> for any users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>API documentation for Guava classes is now easier to reach. For example, for <code>ImmutableList</code>, visit <a href=\"https://guava.dev/ImmutableList\">guava.dev/ImmutableList</a>. Also, more easily access the index at <a href=\"https://guava.dev/api\">guava.dev/api</a>.</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Annotated <code>FluentIterable.from(FluentIterable)</code> with <code>@DoNotCall</code>. (b1c77b7df3)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made <code>ceiling</code>, <code>floor</code>, <code>headSet(E, boolean)</code>, and <code>tailSet(E, boolean)</code> methods available in the GWT-emulated <code>ImmutableSortedSet</code>. (7e0fe90ca8, 5f2fbf27b2)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Made it possible to set a stable incident edge order by calling the newly added method <code>[Value]Graph.Builder.incidentEdgeOrder(ElementOrder.stable())</code>. (70164025a8)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Added <code>incidentEdgeOrder()</code> to the <code>[Value]Graph</code> interfaces. (cde576ec00)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>Duration</code>-based <code>default</code> methods to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. (931e83f969)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>immediateVoidFuture</code>. (9f3bae5853)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Removed <code>@Beta</code> from <code>Service</code> and related classes. (dc46627fea)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the 1-arg overload of <code>ServiceManager.addListener</code>. (86e3620125)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed the return type of <code>ServiceManager.servicesByState()</code> to <code>ImmutableSetMultimap</code> (but also retained a method with the old signature for binary compatibility). (31999ae6f5)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Made it safe to load the <code>AbstractFuture</code> class from a <code>ForkJoinPool</code> thread under a security manager.

href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/guava-announce/zHZTFg7YF3o/rQNnwdHeEwAJ\">Guava types can no longer be sent over GWT-RPC.</a> To <em>temporarily</em> reenable support, set the <code>guava.gwt.emergency_reenable_rpc</code> system property to <code>true</code>. (5214a10b1e)\n<ul>\n<li>This is the only breaking change in this release, and it affects only users of the <code>guava-gwt</code> artifact, not people who use only the <code>guava</code> artifact. This release contains no changes that break <em>binary compatibility</em> for any users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>API documentation for Guava classes is now easier to reach. For example, for <code>ImmutableList</code>, visit <a href=\"https://guava.dev/ImmutableList\">guava.dev/ImmutableList</a>. Also, more easily access the index at <a href=\"https://guava.dev/api\">guava.dev/api</a>.</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Annotated <code>FluentIterable.from(FluentIterable)</code> with <code>@DoNotCall</code>. (b1c77b7df3)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made <code>ceiling</code>, <code>floor</code>, <code>headSet(E, boolean)</code>, and <code>tailSet(E, boolean)</code> methods available in the GWT-emulated <code>ImmutableSortedSet</code>. (7e0fe90ca8, 5f2fbf27b2)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Made it possible to set a stable incident edge order by calling the newly added method <code>[Value]Graph.Builder.incidentEdgeOrder(ElementOrder.stable())</code>. (70164025a8)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Added <code>incidentEdgeOrder()</code> to the <code>[Value]Graph</code> interfaces. (cde576ec00)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>Duration</code>-based <code>default</code> methods to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. (931e83f969)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>immediateVoidFuture</code>. (9f3bae5853)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Removed <code>@Beta</code> from <code>Service</code> and related classes. (dc46627fea)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the 1-arg overload of <code>ServiceManager.addListener</code>. (86e3620125)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed the return type of <code>ServiceManager.servicesByState()</code> to <code>ImmutableSetMultimap</code> (but also retained a method with the old signature for binary compatibility). (31999ae6f5)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Made it safe to load the <code>AbstractFuture</code> class from a <code>ForkJoinPool</code> thread under a security manager. (6e0c5b5d50)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>28.2</h2>\n<h3>Maven</h3>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.guava&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;guava&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;28.2-jre&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;!-- or, for Android: --&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;28.2-android&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/guava-announce/zHZTFg7YF3o/rQNnwdHeEwAJ\">Guava types can no longer be sent over GWT-RPC.</a> To <em>temporarily</em> reenable support, set the <code>guava.gwt.emergency_reenable_rpc</code> system property to <code>true</code>. (5214a10b1e)\n<ul>\n<li>This is the only breaking change in this release, and it affects only users of the <code>guava-gwt</code> artifact, not people who use only the <code>guava</code> artifact. This release contains no changes that break <em>binary compatibility</em> for any users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>API documentation for Guava classes is now easier to reach. For example, for <code>ImmutableList</code>, visit <a href=\"https://guava.dev/ImmutableList\">guava.dev/ImmutableList</a>. Also, more easily access the index at <a href=\"https://guava.dev/api\">guava.dev/api</a>.</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Annotated <code>FluentIterable.from(FluentIterable)</code> with <code>@DoNotCall</code>. (b1c77b7df3)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made <code>ceiling</code>, <code>floor</code>, <code>headSet(E, boolean)</code>, and <code>tailSet(E, boolean)</code> methods available in the GWT-emulated <code>ImmutableSortedSet</code>. (7e0fe90ca8, 5f2fbf27b2)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Made it possible to set a stable incident edge order by calling the newly added method <code>[Value]Graph.Builder.incidentEdgeOrder(ElementOrder.stable())</code>. (70164025a8)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Added <code>incidentEdgeOrder()</code> to the <code>[Value]Graph</code> interfaces. (cde576ec00)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>Duration</code>-based <code>default</code> methods to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. (931e83f969)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>immediateVoidFuture</code>. (9f3bae5853)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Removed <code>@Beta</code> from <code>Service</code> and related classes. (dc46627fea)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the 1-arg overload of <code>ServiceManager.addListener</code>. (86e3620125)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed the return type of <code>ServiceManager.servicesByState()</code> to <code>ImmutableSetMultimap</code> (but also retained a method with the old signature for binary compatibility). (31999ae6f5)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Made it safe to load the <code>AbstractFuture</code> class from a <code>ForkJoinPool</code> thread under a security manager.

href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/guava-announce/zHZTFg7YF3o/rQNnwdHeEwAJ\">Guava types can no longer be sent over GWT-RPC.</a> To <em>temporarily</em> reenable support, set the <code>guava.gwt.emergency_reenable_rpc</code> system property to <code>true</code>. (5214a10b1e)\n<ul>\n<li>This is the only breaking change in this release, and it affects only users of the <code>guava-gwt</code> artifact, not people who use only the <code>guava</code> artifact. This release contains no changes that break <em>binary compatibility</em> for any users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>API documentation for Guava classes is now easier to reach. For example, for <code>ImmutableList</code>, visit <a href=\"https://guava.dev/ImmutableList\">guava.dev/ImmutableList</a>. Also, more easily access the index at <a href=\"https://guava.dev/api\">guava.dev/api</a>.</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Annotated <code>FluentIterable.from(FluentIterable)</code> with <code>@DoNotCall</code>. (b1c77b7df3)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made <code>ceiling</code>, <code>floor</code>, <code>headSet(E, boolean)</code>, and <code>tailSet(E, boolean)</code> methods available in the GWT-emulated <code>ImmutableSortedSet</code>. (7e0fe90ca8, 5f2fbf27b2)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Made it possible to set a stable incident edge order by calling the newly added method <code>[Value]Graph.Builder.incidentEdgeOrder(ElementOrder.stable())</code>. (70164025a8)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Added <code>incidentEdgeOrder()</code> to the <code>[Value]Graph</code> interfaces. (cde576ec00)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>Duration</code>-based <code>default</code> methods to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. (931e83f969)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>immediateVoidFuture</code>. (9f3bae5853)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Removed <code>@Beta</code> from <code>Service</code> and related classes. (dc46627fea)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the 1-arg overload of <code>ServiceManager.addListener</code>. (86e3620125)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed the return type of <code>ServiceManager.servicesByState()</code> to <code>ImmutableSetMultimap</code> (but also retained a method with the old signature for binary compatibility). (31999ae6f5)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Made it safe to load the <code>AbstractFuture</code> class from a <code>ForkJoinPool</code> thread under a security manager.

href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/guava-announce/zHZTFg7YF3o/rQNnwdHeEwAJ\">Guava types can no longer be sent over GWT-RPC.</a> To <em>temporarily</em> reenable support, set the <code>guava.gwt.emergency_reenable_rpc</code> system property to <code>true</code>. (5214a10b1e)\n<ul>\n<li>This is the only breaking change in this release, and it affects only users of the <code>guava-gwt</code> artifact, not people who use only the <code>guava</code> artifact. This release contains no changes that break <em>binary compatibility</em> for any users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>API documentation for Guava classes is now easier to reach. For example, for <code>ImmutableList</code>, visit <a href=\"https://guava.dev/ImmutableList\">guava.dev/ImmutableList</a>. Also, more easily access the index at <a href=\"https://guava.dev/api\">guava.dev/api</a>.</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Annotated <code>FluentIterable.from(FluentIterable)</code> with <code>@DoNotCall</code>. (b1c77b7df3)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made <code>ceiling</code>, <code>floor</code>, <code>headSet(E, boolean)</code>, and <code>tailSet(E, boolean)</code> methods available in the GWT-emulated <code>ImmutableSortedSet</code>. (7e0fe90ca8, 5f2fbf27b2)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Made it possible to set a stable incident edge order by calling the newly added method <code>[Value]Graph.Builder.incidentEdgeOrder(ElementOrder.stable())</code>. (70164025a8)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Added <code>incidentEdgeOrder()</code> to the <code>[Value]Graph</code> interfaces. (cde576ec00)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>Duration</code>-based <code>default</code> methods to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. (931e83f969)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>immediateVoidFuture</code>. (9f3bae5853)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Removed <code>@Beta</code> from <code>Service</code> and related classes. (dc46627fea)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the 1-arg overload of <code>ServiceManager.addListener</code>. (86e3620125)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed the return type of <code>ServiceManager.servicesByState()</code> to <code>ImmutableSetMultimap</code> (but also retained a method with the old signature for binary compatibility). (31999ae6f5)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Made it safe to load the <code>AbstractFuture</code> class from a <code>ForkJoinPool</code> thread under a security manager.

href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/guava-announce/zHZTFg7YF3o/rQNnwdHeEwAJ\">Guava types can no longer be sent over GWT-RPC.</a> To <em>temporarily</em> reenable support, set the <code>guava.gwt.emergency_reenable_rpc</code> system property to <code>true</code>. (5214a10b1e)\n<ul>\n<li>This is the only breaking change in this release, and it affects only users of the <code>guava-gwt</code> artifact, not people who use only the <code>guava</code> artifact. This release contains no changes that break <em>binary compatibility</em> for any users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>API documentation for Guava classes is now easier to reach. For example, for <code>ImmutableList</code>, visit <a href=\"https://guava.dev/ImmutableList\">guava.dev/ImmutableList</a>. Also, more easily access the index at <a href=\"https://guava.dev/api\">guava.dev/api</a>.</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Annotated <code>FluentIterable.from(FluentIterable)</code> with <code>@DoNotCall</code>. (b1c77b7df3)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made <code>ceiling</code>, <code>floor</code>, <code>headSet(E, boolean)</code>, and <code>tailSet(E, boolean)</code> methods available in the GWT-emulated <code>ImmutableSortedSet</code>. (7e0fe90ca8, 5f2fbf27b2)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Made it possible to set a stable incident edge order by calling the newly added method <code>[Value]Graph.Builder.incidentEdgeOrder(ElementOrder.stable())</code>. (70164025a8)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Added <code>incidentEdgeOrder()</code> to the <code>[Value]Graph</code> interfaces. (cde576ec00)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>Duration</code>-based <code>default</code> methods to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. (931e83f969)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>immediateVoidFuture</code>. (9f3bae5853)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Removed <code>@Beta</code> from <code>Service</code> and related classes. (dc46627fea)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the 1-arg overload of <code>ServiceManager.addListener</code>. (86e3620125)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed the return type of <code>ServiceManager.servicesByState()</code> to <code>ImmutableSetMultimap</code> (but also retained a method with the old signature for binary compatibility). (31999ae6f5)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Made it safe to load the <code>AbstractFuture</code> class from a <code>ForkJoinPool</code> thread under a security manager.

href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/guava-announce/zHZTFg7YF3o/rQNnwdHeEwAJ\">Guava types can no longer be sent over GWT-RPC.</a> To <em>temporarily</em> reenable support, set the <code>guava.gwt.emergency_reenable_rpc</code> system property to <code>true</code>. (5214a10b1e)\n<ul>\n<li>This is the only breaking change in this release, and it affects only users of the <code>guava-gwt</code> artifact, not people who use only the <code>guava</code> artifact. This release contains no changes that break <em>binary compatibility</em> for any users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>API documentation for Guava classes is now easier to reach. For example, for <code>ImmutableList</code>, visit <a href=\"https://guava.dev/ImmutableList\">guava.dev/ImmutableList</a>. Also, more easily access the index at <a href=\"https://guava.dev/api\">guava.dev/api</a>.</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Annotated <code>FluentIterable.from(FluentIterable)</code> with <code>@DoNotCall</code>. (b1c77b7df3)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made <code>ceiling</code>, <code>floor</code>, <code>headSet(E, boolean)</code>, and <code>tailSet(E, boolean)</code> methods available in the GWT-emulated <code>ImmutableSortedSet</code>. (7e0fe90ca8, 5f2fbf27b2)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Made it possible to set a stable incident edge order by calling the newly added method <code>[Value]Graph.Builder.incidentEdgeOrder(ElementOrder.stable())</code>. (70164025a8)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Added <code>incidentEdgeOrder()</code> to the <code>[Value]Graph</code> interfaces. (cde576ec00)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>Duration</code>-based <code>default</code> methods to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. (931e83f969)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>immediateVoidFuture</code>. (9f3bae5853)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Removed <code>@Beta</code> from <code>Service</code> and related classes. (dc46627fea)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the 1-arg overload of <code>ServiceManager.addListener</code>. (86e3620125)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed the return type of <code>ServiceManager.servicesByState()</code> to <code>ImmutableSetMultimap</code> (but also retained a method with the old signature for binary compatibility). (31999ae6f5)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Made it safe to load the <code>AbstractFuture</code> class from a <code>ForkJoinPool</code> thread under a security manager.

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nFlowFiles logged in logger Object[] param are now parsed and added to Bulletins.\r\n\r\n**JIRA:** https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-8385\r\n\r\n- Extended LogMessage with FlowFile attribute. Created LogMessage builder to avoid excessive method overloading in StandardLogRepository. Extended the classes with the new method implementing this interface: _rules.handlers.MockComponentLog, util.MockComponentLog, MockComponentLogger, NopComponentLog, SimpleProcessLogger, TerminationAwareLogger_.\r\n- Extended LogRepository with new method to use LogMessage as parameter.\r\n- In StandardLogRepository each method gets the flow file from the logger Object[] argument or from the LogMessage object.\r\n- Created Bulletin builder to avoid excessive method overloading in BulletinFactory\r\n- Removed Bulletin descendants: _SystemBulletin, MockBulletin, ComponentBulletin_\r\n- Removed nifi-mock/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/reporting/BulletinFactory\r\n- Changed factory to builder in: _MockReportingContext, StandardRemoteProcessGroup, BulletinAdapter, ControllerServiceLogObserver, ProcessorLogObserver, ReportingTaskLogObserver, TestNodeBulletinStrategy, StandardPublicPort, TestSiteToSiteBulletinReportingTask_\r\n- Extracted ID generation from BulletinFactory to BulletinIdProvider (used by Bulletin.Builder too)\r\n- Moved LogMessage to nifi-api\r\n- Code cleanup: _ReportingContext, TestAlertHandler, ScriptedActionHandlerTest, SiteToSiteBulletinReportingTask_\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nRemoves the call to `isAfterLast()` in favor of catching SQLFeatureNotSupportedException in `getArray()` instead, since such an exception can be thrown on either method call.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

would be my proposal to add some useful feature for working with records: the PR contains three processors, similar to the `ScriptedTransformRecord`. Other than adding an abstract implementation with the common behaviour, the changes should not effect existing features. The new processors:\r\n- ScriptedValidateRecord: validates records using an user-defined script, and routing them to valid or invalid relationship accordingly.\r\n- ScriptedFilterRecord: filters out records from incoming flow file based on script\r\n- ScriptedPartitionRecord: split the incoming records into partitions using a script and then routing them into relationships defined by the user.\r\n\r\nAlso, [here](https://gist.github.com/simonbence/e2e059b906f635e8c5eb7b5bb8a84341) is a template which might help testing or trying out the processors.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\nThis provides an enhancement to the AMQP Processors to allow multiple hosts to be specified in a broker list. By specifying multiple hosts, a connection is made to one of the hosts, errors are only thrown if none of the hosts in the list are reachable. This property should only be used to specify amqp nodes in the same cluster. By specifying 2 nodes from 2 different clusters, only one cluster will be interacted with by NiFi.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ Yes] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [Yes] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ Yes] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ Yes] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ Yes] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [Yes] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ Yes] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ Yes] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ N/A] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ N/A] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ N/A] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ No, the other properties in the existing processor do not make use of a displayName ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ N/A] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-26T12:35:49Z","updated_at":"2021-04-09T15:42:56Z","closed_at":"2021-04-09T15:42:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c7200058cabed2fd80e97e75c50bf7d8938f856","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4939/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4939/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4939/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/46999b91699f8807741b5761c37ac04862da20e7","head":{"label":"nabmoh123:nifi-8341","ref":"nifi-8341","sha":"46999b91699f8807741b5761c37ac04862da20e7","user":{"login":"nabmoh123","id":78485878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NDg1ODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78485878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123","html_url":"https://github.com/nabmoh123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":351736027,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTE3MzYwMjc=","name":"nifi","full_name":"nabmoh123/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nabmoh123","id":78485878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NDg1ODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78485878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123","html_url":"https://github.com/nabmoh123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabmoh123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nabmoh123/nifi","description":"Apache

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nCopies the code from nifi-minifi master branch to a module of nifi. Bumps NiFi dependency version to latest (1.14.0-SNAPSHOT), replaces some MiNiFi components with their NiFi counterparts, moved MiNiFi \"common\" libraries back into the individual NARs rather than dumping them all into lib/. The size is still large (188MB), a follow-up PR could do some additional refactor to reduce the overall size of the MiNiFi binary. This PR is to produce a functioning MiNiFi binary from inside the NiFi codebase.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nThis pull requests builds upon the original PR https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4065 from @gerdansantos.\r\n(a new fork/branch was created due to lack of permissions and original commits were cherrypicked)\r\n\r\nTogether with my colleague @mathiasbosman, I evaluated the original code. We observed a couple of things:\r\n- Java best practices not always followed\r\n- Resources not optimal closed\r\n- Sometimes poor exception handling\r\n- Few bugs (e.g. inside decode logic for complex messages)\r\n- No tests\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes many of those things and is targeted at 1.14.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\nThere's still room for lots of improvements but that would take us to far. We just started using NiFi (and are not Postgres experts either)...\r\n\r\nSome things which are still questionable:\r\n- initial snapshot is loaded entirely in memory (so not to be used for large tables)\r\n- motivation/decisions behind message formats (and their differences: snapshot vs simple vs complex)\r\n\r\nAnother important observation, the MySQL CDC has a concept of sequence ID (which can be used by an EnforceOrder processor). This is missing in this Postgres implementation. If order of events is important, are there other NiFi options to guarantee this (in a cluster) or will such a concept also be mandatory?\r\n\r\nIdeally both the MySQL CDC and Postgres CDC should use the same canonical message model. But that's out of scope for us.\r\n\r\nOur main wish is to have a (minimal) Postgres CDC processor which is part of the official NiFi distribution, hence our intent to move the original PR forward.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character. **--> existing JIRA NIFI-4239**\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? **--> partially, commits of original author left as individual commits**\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder? **--> with -skipTests but Github actions builds pass**\r\n- [x]  Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes? **--> integration test**\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?  **--> PostgreSQL JDBC Driver**\r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered? **--> there wasn't any... no additional added...**\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Exception (resulting in an ABORT_TRANSACTION status code) when attempting to add received FlowFiles to the FlowFile queue, if the node is not currently connected to cluster. In this case, ensure that we remove the received FlowFiles from the FlowFile Repository and emit a DROP event to the repository (with appropriate details) to coincide with the already-committed Provenance events. Also ensure that when a node is disconnected that we don't keep sending to that node until it reconnects. While testing the fixes via LoadBalancedQueueIT, also noticed that unit test logging was not working properly in nifi-framework-core because of the (erroneous) dependency on logback-class; removed this dependency and updated unit tests that were created that depended on its existence.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8304-4 Replaces `HttpsURLConnection` with `OkHttpClient` in `TestListenHTTP` in an effort to provide a more reliable approach to making requests over HTTP and HTTPS.  Each test method creates a new instance of `OkHttpClient` and avoids reusing connections.  `TestListenHTTP` did not call `disconnect()` on `HttpsURLConnection` and could have failed to close the connection output stream in certain conditions.  Use of `OkHttpClient` also includes setting a 10 second call timeout to avoid extended waits for failing requests.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
