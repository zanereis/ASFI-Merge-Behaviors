If any of the objects were missing, downstream tasks would fail so we needed a sensor that would only resolve to `True` if all keys were accounted for.\r\n\r\nHere is the proposed API:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntask = S3MultiKeySensor(\r\n  task_id='task_id',\r\n  bucket_name='bucket'\r\n  bucket_keys=[\r\n    'key1',\r\n    'key2',\r\n    'key3'\r\n  ]\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm sharing the solution we came up with in case it might prove useful to others with similar use cases. I don't have a clear picture of the broader community's preferred dev ergonomics, so if the code needs to be made more robust or if the Airflow team would prefer that I also add support for multiple buckets, full s3:// urls, etc. please just let me know and I'm happy to update this PR.","created_at":"2022-04-05T23:04:02Z","updated_at":"2022-04-06T17:20:12Z","closed_at":"2022-04-06T17:20:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc08d9df45698e87fc763f8a321fb378b7f5e85f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

the task instance is executed it fetches variables accessed in template and during variable access calls `mask_secret` add filter for secret variables. It also creates new `RenderedTaskInstanceFields` where the masked values are stored by calling `redact`. Subsequent rendering of executed tasks use `RenderedTaskInstanceFields` and redacted values. \r\n\r\nWhen the task instance is not executed and when we try to render then `RenderedTaskInstanceFields` is not created and rendering template calls `mask_secret` to add filters but the output itself is not masked. So we have to use `RenderedTaskInstanceFields` where initialization does template rendering and also masks secrets.\r\n\r\ncloses: #22738\r\nrelated: #22738\r\n\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

`S3PrefixSensor` and use `S3KeySensor` instead.\r\n\r\n## Why deprecating `S3PrefixSensor`?\r\n`S3PrefixSensor` and `S3KeySensor` are doing pretty much the same thing so to avoid duplicates, we should deprecate one.\r\nAlso `S3PrefixSensor` does not behave the way it is described by the documentation in comments and the way you expect by the name. `S3PrefixSensor` does not wait for a given prefix in S3 to exist but it waits for a given folder in S3 to exist (given the delimiter is `/`). Here are some examples I ran for testing.\r\n- `prefix=\"test\"`. `true` when directory `test` exists\r\n- `prefix=\"test\"`. `false` when directory `test` does not exist and file `test` exists\r\n- `prefix=\"test\"`. `false` when directory `test` does not exist and file `test2` exists\r\n- `prefix=\"tes\"`. `false` when directory `test` exists\r\n\r\nThis misalignment between expected behavior and actual one is confusing for users. [Example of thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71511535/s3prefixsensor-in-mwaa?noredirect=1#comment126395890_71511535) where a user does not understand why `S3PrefixSensor` behave this way.\r\n\r\n## Why updating `S3KeySensor`?\r\nIn order to be backward compatible we want to use `S3KeySensor` instead. `S3PrefixSensor` accept a list of files as input, so `S3KeySensor` should be too\r\n\r\n## What is `default_check_fn` and why do we need it?\r\n`S3KeySizeSensor` works this way: you can provide a custom function to this sensor to apply an additional check layer. If you dont provide one, `default_check_fn` is used instead. We will need it to be backward compatible and keep the current behavior of `S3KeySizeSensor` as it is today.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-04T20:32:52Z","updated_at":"2022-04-14T08:44:43Z","closed_at":"2022-04-12T05:22:51Z","merged_at":"2022-04-12T05:22:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"dffb0d27f25b9a1f2497535cb87de3b889aae9d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

is a review and clean-up for all the parameters and\r\ncommands for Breeze2 in order to prepare it for being\r\nused by the contribugors.\r\n\r\nThere are various small fixes here and there, removal\r\nof duplicated code, refactoring and moving code around\r\nas well as cleanup and review all the parameters used\r\nfor all implemented commands.\r\n\r\nThe parameters, default values and their behaviours were\r\nupdated to match \"new\" life of Breeze rather than old\r\none.\r\n\r\nSome improvements are made to the autocomplete and\r\nclick help messages printed.  Full list of choices is\r\nalways displayed, parameters are groups according to\r\ntheir target audience, and they were sorted according\r\nto importance and frequency of use.\r\n\r\nVarious messages have been colourised according to their\r\nmeaning - warnings as yellow, errors as red and\r\ninformational messages as bright_blue.\r\n\r\nThe `dry-run` option has been added to just show what\r\nwould have been run without actually running some\r\npotentially \"write\" commands (read commands are still\r\nexecuted) so that you can easily verify and manually\r\ncopy and execute the commands with option to modify\r\nthem before. The `dry_run` and `verbose` options are\r\nnow used for all commands.\r\n\r\nThe \"main\" command now runs \"shell\" by default similarly\r\nas the original Breeze.\r\n\r\nAll \"shortcut\" parameters have been standardized - i.e\r\ncommon options (verbose/dry run/help) have one and all\r\ncommon flags that are likely to be used often have an\r\nassigned shortcute.\r\n\r\nThe \"stop\" and \"cleanup\" command have been added\r\nas they are necessary for average user to complete the\r\nregular usage cycle.\r\n\r\nDocumentation for all the important methods have been\r\nupdated.\r\n\r\nThis one is based on #22695 so check only last commit\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

log level was set to `warning` but it raises and `AirflowException`. I believe it should be `error` level. Code snippet:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif ti.state == State.RUNNING:\r\n            fqdn = get_hostname()\r\n            same_hostname = fqdn == ti.hostname\r\n            if not same_hostname:\r\n    -->          self.log.warning(\r\n                    \"The recorded hostname %s does not match this instance's hostname %s\",\r\n                    ti.hostname,\r\n                    fqdn,\r\n                )\r\n                raise AirflowException(\"Hostname of job runner does not match\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe warning message misleads the actual error (in my case, it was due to Azure dynamic DNS changing the hostname). If it was an error (as it raises an exception), my team would have found the culprit earlier.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR re-arranges tags int GitHub actions to be more explicit in\r\nthe pull/build/push steps on which tag of the image is currently\r\npulled/pushed/built.\r\n\r\nPreviously the actual configuration of those steps was determined\r\nby combining \"top\", \"job\" and \"step\" variables, but that gave\r\nlittle insight on what combinations of evn variables was used in\r\nthe step eventually. After this change, in all the pull/push/build\r\nsteps you can see what environment is used for that build.\r\n\r\nAlso, since we often build and push and then pull the same image in\r\nthe same workflow, the PUSH tag was sometimes used in PULL\r\nvariable as input. We change it now by introducing single\r\n`IMAGE_TAG_FOR_THE_BUILD` which will be used as PUSH and PULL\r\ntag as needed.\r\n\r\nThis one also fixes failure of PROD cache builds which did not\r\npull the right CI image.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR fixes the cleanup procedures of the `DAGFileProcessor`s being spawned by the `DagFileProcessorManager` instance. Thus, this PR closes #22191.\r\n\r\nWe came across this bug when encountering a timeout triggering the forceful killing of these `DAGFileProcessor`s.\r\n\r\nWe have had somewhat lengthy discussion on an issue (#22191) which we encourage anyone to read for some more insight into the cause, discovery and posterior fix. People on that thread were extremely helpful! 😸\r\n\r\nWe **have not** included tests because we're unsure of how to test a behaviour such as this one. If pointed in the right direction we would be more than happy to add them. We can say however that we applied these changes on our own production Airflow instance and we haven't encountered the issue ever since.\r\n\r\nOn top of that we would be more than welcome if you made any suggestions to the code: for instance, when cleaning up a dictionary we're iterating over we decided to take note of the problematic `DAGFileProcessor`s to then remove them on a second `for` loop. Our background in programming is much stronger on some other languages and so we feel really uncomfortable pushing Python 'to the limit' in terms of relying on its implementation to make design choices. If there's anything that can be done better by all means say so.\r\n\r\nAnother fertile topic for discussion is how to `wait()` for the processes being killed through the `SIGKILL` signal. This has been brought up by @dlesco on #22191 and we agree with him on adding an optional timeout to the operation to avoid blocking in very bizarre circumstances (which the current solution would do). However, we decided to contribute our initial approach and then iterate on solutions within the PR.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for letting me contribute to a tool with the expertise and size of Airflow: it's truly an honour.\r\n\r\nHope to make the merge as seamless as possible 😜\r\n\r\ncloses:

plus #22677 close #22665.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we only count 'expand' as \"called\" when the function ends\r\nsuccessfully. This however means the \"not called\" warning would be\r\nemitted if the 'expand' call is made, but ends with an exception.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is not strictly accurate to count a task as mapped without\r\n'expand' being completed, the behavior described above emits a\r\ndisturbing, superfulous warning that the user already knows about on a\r\nDAG-parsing error, which should be much more common than edge cases when\r\n'expand' does not finish, but the DAG-parsing process does not fail\r\n(e.g. if the user wraps task creation in a try-except block), so this\r\nshould be a reasonable tradeoff.\r\n\r\nThis also simplifies the warning being emitted when 'expand' is indeed\r\nnever called, to only show the object's task_id or Python object ID,\r\ninstead of the entire task object representation. This should make the\r\nmessage more concise and easier to understand.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

change completes the work required to allow nameOverride and fullnameOverride to function as expected. Kubernetes objects will now be created in a manner consistent with current helm conventions. \r\n\r\nObjects created with fullnameOverride specified will use the fullnameOverride to create object names.\r\nIf nameOverride is specified the value of nameOverride is combined with the chart name to create object names.\r\nIf nameOverride and fullnameOverride are both specified then fullnameOverride will take precedence.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/22622\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

When the user instantiates the `AirflowFlyteOperator`, it creates a `FlyteRemote` (Flyte's Python API) object, triggers the execution in the Flyte environment, waits for the execution to complete, and finally, returns the execution name. This implementation is carried out using the methods defined in the `hook`. The executions are triggered synchronously by default. One can set `asynchronous` to `True` if the execution needs to be polled asynchronously; the polling would be handled by the `sensor`.\r\n\r\nTests\r\n------\r\nUnit tests have been added and tested. Also, I spun up an Airflow instance to validate the code in real-time.\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n------\r\n- [ ] Update the flytekit version from `0.32.0b0` to `0.32.0` after the latter release is out.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more

When the user instantiates the `AirflowFlyteOperator`, it creates a `FlyteRemote` (Flyte's Python API) object, triggers the execution in the Flyte environment, waits for the execution to complete, and finally, returns the execution name. This implementation is carried out using the methods defined in the `hook`. The executions are triggered synchronously by default. One can set `asynchronous` to `True` if the execution needs to be polled asynchronously; the polling would be handled by the `sensor`.\r\n\r\nTests\r\n------\r\nUnit tests have been added and tested. Also, I spun up an Airflow instance to validate the code in real-time.\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n------\r\n- [ ] Update the flytekit version from `0.32.0b0` to `0.32.0` after the latter release is out.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more

BaseHook currently logs connection details including password at the DEBUG level. While the password is redacted under normal conditions in task logs, there are edge cases where this can lead to a password leaking into logs, such as calling python code that uses a hook from a BashOperator.\r\n\r\nThe value of logging the password simply seems small relative to the consequences of leaking to logs even in edge cases. There remain plenty of ways to log the password if that is explicitly what you want to do, such as `airflow connection

order to allow \"big\" rebuilds we remove the image tag\r\nbefore rebuilding, to make sure that the remote and not local image\r\nis used as source of cache.

This\r\nshould handle the situation when we tried to build the image and\r\nstopped it in-between.\r\n\r\nHadolint released a new version of their checker - with support\r\nfor the new Dockerfile buildkit features and native support for\r\nARM so we are enabling it back.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/pull/803\r\n\r\nFinally we still need some files that we cannot inline, because\r\nthey are only needed for source build and they are too long\r\nto inline (yarn.lock for example).

is - I hope - final fix for our image caching. I fought with\r\nit for quite a while and it turned out that I was fighting with\r\nbuidkit bug when preparing a multiplatform image.\r\n\r\nI think I finally got it under control, the main problem was that\r\nwhen we prepared multi-platform image, seems like the image that\r\nwas prepared \"last\" was overriding the cache that was prepared\r\nby the other platform build. This cause numerous problems with\r\ninvestigating it, because sometimes it looked like it worked,\r\nwhen the \"other\" platform was faster to build and someties it\r\ndid not when it was slower. It almost drove me mad.\r\n\r\nIt looks like however, that the inline cache works better in\r\nthis case (and I got it repetetively working) so finally we might\r\ngo back to faster builds on CI and fast pull for ./breeze.\r\n\r\nI also opened an issue at buildkit, hoping that they will be able\r\nto fix it:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/2758\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
