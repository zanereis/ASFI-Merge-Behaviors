the JIRA ticket here.](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-3258)\r\n\r\n`DiskStoreCommands` was a huge class that contained a large number of commands. These commands have been split into their own individual command classes. Two methods shared by several commands were moved into `DiskStoreCommandsUtils` (it has been mentioned before that --Utils classes should be avoided, but because a better home for these methods could not be found, this issue may be resolved later in the future).\r\n\r\nSome tests were also updated - `DiskStoreCommandsJUnitTest` and `ListAndDescribeDiskStoreCommandsDUnitTest`. It really looks like the two tests share many of the same functionalities... I think that `ListAndDescribeDiskStoreCommandsDUnitTest` could be removed, since `DiskStoreCommandsJUnitTest` already seems to test `ListDiskStoreCommand` and `DescribeDiskStoreCommand`, and `DiskStoreCommandsJUnitTest` should be updated to test more commands, since it only seems to be testing `list disk-store` and `describe disk-store`.\r\n\r\n**TESTING STATUS: Precheckin all

the JIRA ticket here.](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-3230)\r\n\r\n`CliStrings.java` contained a lot of Strings that were not used anywhere in the code. In this PR, each of these seemingly unused Strings were examined to find potential uses of them in the code. Strings that did seem useful were inserted into the code as needed. Strings that didn't seem to be useful were deleted. Strings that don't seem to be used, but are used in the closed side, were preserved and tagged as such.\r\n\r\n(Note: An attempt was made to use all Strings that weren't currently being used in parts of the code that seemed appropriate, but most of these were removed because they broke tests.)\r\n\r\n**Testing Status**: **Precheckin completed successfully**\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x]

class that contained commands for starting a server (`startServer`) and for starting a locator (`startLocator`). In this PR, these gfsh commands have been extracted and moved to their own classes (`StartLocatorCommand.java` and `StartServerCommand.java`). Then, the other methods associated with these two gfsh commands were refactored and moved to their associated classes _or_ a new shared `StartMemberUtils` class. Tests associated with `LauncherLifecycleCommands.java` were moved to `GfshCommandJUnitTest.java`, `StartServerCommandTest.java`, `StartServerCommandIntegrationTest.java` `StartLocatorCommandTest.java`, or `StartLocatorCommandIntegrationTest.java` based on what they tested.\r\n\r\n**Testing Progress:** precheckin completed successfully\r\n\r\n- [x] JIRA ticket

the JIRA ticket here.](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-2818)\r\n\r\nChanges were previously implemented to allow users to use either `--group` or `--groups` and `--member` or `--members` and `--jar` or `--jars` when specifying parameters for certain commands. @sbawaska found that these changes weren't fully implemented for some commands, though, so this PR aims to fix this. Two tests were also implemented to cover all related changes:\r\n\r\n- `OptionAliasesIntegrationTest.java` uses `GfshRule` to show that these changes work in the environment (gfsh). Note that this test is not completed yet, as some commands were impractical to implement (since they required setting up certain permissions, etc.). The test could also be improved by not only running the commands, but also checking the contents of the logs written up by the `GfshRule`, although these logs aren't accessible yet (changes pending via @jaredjstewart). I'll probably file a JIRA ticket to keep track of these improvements to this test.\r\n- `OptionAliasesParsingTest.java` shows that all the commands that accept either `--group` or `--groups` and `--member` or `--members` and `--jar` or `--jars` are parsed correctly.\r\n\r\nSome imports were also reordered in the process of implementing changes and writing tests.\r\n\r\n**_Precheckin status:
