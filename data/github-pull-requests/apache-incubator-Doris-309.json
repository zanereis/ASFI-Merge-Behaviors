Users may parse the string to array before they use it. Therefore, we should output the data in some format (e.g. json) and users can do the transformation more conveniently.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nhash join node used children's output tableref ids to create its own output tuple info. But when creating intermedia tuple, the hash join node used children's output tuple ids, which is inconsistent with creating output tuple. This pr use children's output tuple ids for both intermedia tuple and output tuple to keep them consistent\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nAt now, the http interface `executeSQL` is executing in a synchronous manner, it will store all ResultSets read from jdbc.This may cause OOM exception with this method.The current solution is to limit ResultSets rows in fe to avoid `OOM`.\r\n\r\nI use `JSONWriter` of gson and `PrintWriter` of HttpServletResponse to implement streaming response. We use jdbc to read ResultSets in streaming manner and response client in streaming manner too.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n**Fix three bugs**\r\n1. `ExprContext` is delete in `ParquetReader::close()`, but it has not been closed, so the `DCHECH` in `~ExprContext()` is failed. the lifetime of `ExprContext` is managed by scan node, so we should not delete its pointer in `ParquetReader::close()`.\r\n2. `RowGroupReader::next_batch` will update `_read_rows` in every column loop, and does not ensure the number of rows in every column are equal.\r\n3.  The skipped row ranges are variables in stack, which are released when calling `ArrayColumnReader::read_column_data`, so we should copy them out.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n4. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n6. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n7. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-31T09:36:26Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T07:19:19Z","closed_at":"2022-09-02T01:50:25Z","merged_at":"2022-09-02T01:50:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"202ad5c659c243e370b18a5ed8661be0068af7fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

`materializeInlineViewResultExprForCrossJoinOrCountStar`), though the single node plan has been generated, and the generation of plan is dependent on the materialized attribute, so apparently there is a parodox here.\r\n\r\nFix:\r\n\r\n1. Materialize all slot in the chain of sourceExprs.\r\n2. Materialize agg info again after the creation of table ref with join operator\r\n3. Add all the SlotDescriptor to HashJoinNode's output from child output no matter is materilalized or not\r\n4. Once the Slot is required keep it in the output tuple instead of pruning it, no matter the slot is materialized or not\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Problem summary\r\n\r\nThere are some bugs in Nereids' StatsCalculator.\r\n- Project: return child column stats directly, so its parents cannot find column stats from project's slot.\r\n- Aggregate: do not return column that is `Alias`, its parents cannot find some column stats from Aggregate's slot.\r\n- All: use `SlotReference` as key of column to stats map. So we need change SlotReference's `equals` and `hashCode` method to just using `ExprId` as we discussed.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3.
