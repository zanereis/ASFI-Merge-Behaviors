cleans up InternalElasticsearchClient in preparation of\nElasticsearch 5 work.\n\nFormerly, the client implementation was required to search the response\nof a request for specific paths of aggregation bucket keys. This\nrequired an intermediary to allow the same response to be read for two\npaths. Since implementations are trusted, the change is that we search\nfor \"any\" bucket keys. This is simpler to test and requires less\ncoordination.\n\nOn that note, there was a bug in the aggregation logic, where annotation\naggregations weren't treated as nested. This fixes the bug and rewrites\nthe test to expose it in the future.\n\nIn order to plug-in a different span indexer, I needed to re-organize\nthat code. Now, there's a BulkSpanIndexer type which can be exteded as\nneeded.\n\nSee #1312\n","created_at":"2016-09-25T09:24:47Z","updated_at":"2016-09-26T10:55:43Z","closed_at":"2016-09-26T10:55:40Z","merged_at":"2016-09-26T10:55:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"76edbbf0491ced8295fa8ec1ad89fa1aaa83b618","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/1313/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/1313/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1313/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/statuses/a71e445ce1b180bec504ea5aa85b6d8b1f058da6","head":{"label":"openzipkin:es-cleanup","ref":"es-cleanup","sha":"a71e445ce1b180bec504ea5aa85b6d8b1f058da6","user":{"login":"openzipkin","id":11860887,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExODYwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11860887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4576305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTc2MzA1","name":"zipkin","full_name":"openzipkin/zipkin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"openzipkin","id":11860887,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExODYwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11860887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin","description":"Zipkin

order to support elasticsearch on AWS (and other *aaS vendors) that\nchoose not to expose the ES binary protocol, we must have an option for\nclients to use the native transport or REST.\n\nTowards that end, this change refactors the existing storage client\ninteractions behind an interface that can be replaced by a different\ntransport. Almost all the changes were non-functional, with the\nexception of three methods:\n- getRawTrace\n- getServiceNames\n- getSpanNames\n\nWhich now use the leinientExpandOpen strategy for their index selection.\nWe anticipate this is a positive change, as skipping unavailable (or\nclosed) indexes will at worst present a partial span for the period\nof time that the index is unavailable, which seems be prefereable to\na hard error.\n\nAlso, when using the same elasticsearch cluster for multiple Zipkin\ninstances (i.e. running tests + a local development server) the\ninstances will race to claim the `zipkin_template` with a pattern\nthat will match only their indices – so if the tests are run first,\nthen the local server's indices will have only an implicit schema, or\n vice versa.\n\nThis change modifies the name of the template on a per-index-pattern\nbasis, so multiple templates can happily coexist. For the default\n`zipkin` index prefix, users should not observe any change in\nbehavior. NB: It may be necessary to delete unstructured indexes or\nclear out old `zipkin_template` templates in some cases to get\nmultiple instances working together.\n\nThis commit is the first step in support of

order to get a proof of concept working against AWS managed elasticsearch (press button get cluster) I found it necessary to refactor some of the existing storage code to allow it to operate over the native java API or the HTTP API (AWS elasticsearch only supports the latter).\n\nWith these changes, a simple `STORAGE_TYPE=elasticsearch ES_HOSTS=https://my-cool-endpoint.us-west-2.es.amazonaws.com/ java -jar ./zipkin-server/target/zipkin-server-*exec.jar` is all it takes to get a reasonably well managed ES backend for a Zipkin deployment.\n\nI'm passing this along in the hope someone else would

Zipkin wrote the wrong timestamp when receiving spans that\nare missing timestamp data. It is still the case that instrumentation\nlibraries aren't updated to add this. Until then, we have to guess a\nlittle more smartly so as to not record incorrect timestamps.\n\nThis does the following when Span.timestamp is missing:\n- If there is a \"cs\", use that (because client always is authoritative)\n- If there is an \"sr\" in a root span, use that\n- Otherwise, return null instead of choosing an arbitrary low value.\n\nThis also is more careful when updating timestamps, for example, in\nMySQL, we only update if the span's timestamp is set or on client send.\n\nThis change has some impact, notably that duration queries now require\ninstrumentation to update to actually set Span.duration. Also,\nelasticsearch \"timestamp_millis\" field is now used directly for queries.\n\nTo facilitate better instrumentation, I've added more

in https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1204 lead to an agreement that upgrading the C\\* datamodel and taking advantage of latest features may be the best path forward.\n\nZipkin Cassandra clusters are expected to be dedicated clusters, therefore should be relatively free to upgrade.\n\nThe new datamodel takes advantage of MATERIALIZED VIEWS and SASI (b-tree secondary indexes).\n\nIt reduces 7 tables down to 2 tables. (Excluding the dependencies table.)\n\nThe new schema is…\n\n```\n\nCREATE TYPE IF NOT EXISTS endpoint (\n    service_name text,\n    ipv4         inet,\n    ipv6         inet,\n    port

DO NOT MERGE YET\n\nContinuing the work in #1248, this PR is the place to discuss whether, when, and how we want to move releasing from Travis to CircleCI.\n\n_openzipkin/zipkin on CircleCI_: https://circleci.com/gh/openzipkin/zipkin\n\nWhy: https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1237\n## Things to consider before merging\n- Do we like the trade-off CircleCI makes in terms of build executors? OSS orgs (NOT repos) get a total of 4 containers, meaning we can do 4 things at the same time. At the moment `openzipkin/zipkin` is configured to use all 4 containers for running tests in parallel, but over time we may want to have concurrent builds of separate commits / branches. PRs also run on the same pool of containers, as well as any other `openzipkin` projects we may migrate to CircleCI in the future. OTOH we can pay monies for more containers, unlike with Travis (citation needed).\n- Do we want to spend extra effort on doing a test-run of the deployment process on \"non-production\" Bintray / Maven repos?\n- Are we really comfortable jumping onto CircleCI? Maybe run a dual setup for a while and learn by doing.\n## Things to do before merging\n- Review! ;)\n- Add credentials to CircleCI, in one of two ways:\n  - Via the web UI: https://circleci.com/docs/environment-variables/#setting-environment-variables-for-all-commands-without-adding-them-to-git\n  - Encrypted in `circle.yml`, tooling more rudimentary than in Travis: https://github.com/circleci/encrypted-files\n- Disable builds on Travis to avoid confusion when they both want to upload to Bintray\n- Enable \"GitHub Status updates\" on https://circleci.com/gh/openzipkin/zipkin/edit#advanced-settings\n- Replace build badge in `README.md` (https://circleci.com/gh/openzipkin/zipkin/edit#badges)\n","created_at":"2016-08-20T14:27:54Z","updated_at":"2018-10-26T06:24:31Z","closed_at":"2018-03-15T01:31:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f9778ec3aeb0b65553f4bfb05f005ef6eadbadef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6517856,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NTE3ODU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true,"description":null},{"id":6517859,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NTE3ODU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true,"description":null},{"id":237089003,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzcwODkwMDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/labels/releng","name":"releng","color":"009800","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/1250/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/1250/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1250/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/statuses/b4b1e92105fc52a2853239c50a3afd649e101f2d","head":{"label":"openzipkin:circle-ci-publish","ref":"circle-ci-publish","sha":"b4b1e92105fc52a2853239c50a3afd649e101f2d","user":{"login":"openzipkin","id":11860887,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExODYwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11860887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4576305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTc2MzA1","name":"zipkin","full_name":"openzipkin/zipkin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"openzipkin","id":11860887,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExODYwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11860887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin","description":"Zipkin

adds `Codec.gather`, which allows you to gather a list of byte\narrays into a single encoded message.\n\nReporters like HTrace dequeue spans reported into a list of byte arrays.\n\nThis allows insight into the size of message before you send it. For\nexample, you can pop until you have up to 1MB of spans as opposed to\n100 spans (which might end up as 100MB!).\n\nNote this is slightly less efficient than writing a list directly, so\nit is special-cased for the reporting use case, where spans are encoded\nin a separate scope than sent.\n\n```\nBenchmark                                       Mode  Cnt  Score   Error

is an api compatible change to allow code sharing between zipkin\nserver and instrumentation, and without having to publish 2 jar files.\n\nWe accidentally broke the ability to make agent-based instrumentation by\ncompiling our model classes against Java 7 bytecode. Particularly, this\ncauses a regression in Brave.\n\nTo move back to Java 6 bytecode, we had to do a few things:\n- replace moshi internal dependency with gson, which is java 6 compliant\n- remove okio dependency and copy its Base64 class \n  - incidentally a class it also copied!\n- do variable-size buffer writes w/ byte arrays instead of okio\n- fix a few nags about diamond ops etc.\n\nSee

does a number of things to improve performance.\n\nQUERY_LOOKBACK prevents the server from having to construct queries that\nare longer than indexes. This value was used by default which led to a\ncouple major problems.\n- When looking for performance problems, you aren't usually looking for 7 day old data, and even if you were, it wouldn't fit into a limit of 10. Changing to a much smaller amount was requested in #1210\n- Cassandra duration queries convert into lookback/1hr requests. A\n  default of 7 days means 168 requests. This led to most users being\n  unable to use the duration query function.\n- By changing to 1hr, our 10 trace limit is very likely to apply, and in\n  the case of Cassandra, we will only pull a single bucket.\n\nIn #1185, we know we want to change to daily granularity. By switching\nlookback to 1 day (decoupled from the 1hr lookback on traces), we better\nprepare for that change.\n\nI also noticed that we document queryLimit to 10, but config.js says 15.\nRegardless of the correct value, they should be aligned.\n","created_at":"2016-07-31T17:59:33Z","updated_at":"2016-07-31T19:46:43Z","closed_at":"2016-07-31T19:46:41Z","merged_at":"2016-07-31T19:46:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"23d6e724b6006e464d6c8a69ba3469a831e6fdc4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/1212/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/1212/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1212/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/statuses/deb408fb773310d4c467ee45f444f7a991f0273e","head":{"label":"openzipkin:lookback","ref":"lookback","sha":"deb408fb773310d4c467ee45f444f7a991f0273e","user":{"login":"openzipkin","id":11860887,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExODYwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11860887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4576305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTc2MzA1","name":"zipkin","full_name":"openzipkin/zipkin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"openzipkin","id":11860887,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExODYwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11860887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin","description":"Zipkin

does two things:\n- Over-fetches cassandra trace indexes to improve UX and fixes Cassandra index\n- Restores fix for Cassandra indexes that lost traces in the same millisecond (#1153) \n\nThe latter is possible because of recent optimizations including this change.\n## New change below:\n\nEven when optimized, cassandra indexes will have more rows than distinct\n(trace_id, timestamp) needed to satisfy query requests. This side-effect\nin most cases is that users get less than `QueryRequest.limit` results\nback. Lacking the ability to do any deduplication server-side, the only\nopportunity left is to address this client-side.\n\nThis over-fetches by a multiplier `CASSANDRA_INDEX_FETCH_MULTIPLIER`,\nwhich defaults to 3. For example, if a user requests 10 traces, 30 rows\nare requested from indexes, but only 10 distinct trace ids are queried\nfor span data.\n\nTo disable this feature, set `CASSANDRA_INDEX_FETCH_MULTIPLIER=1`\n\nFixes

What this does\n\nThis skips index operations that don't wouldn't improve api queries. It does this by only indexing when it would change the gap of a trace's time interval.\n\nFor example, a trace that fans out into N spans against the same service\nwill end up with a fixed amount of cassandra inserts as opposed to a\nfunction of N.\n### What this doesn't do\n\nThis doesn't affect duration indexing, as that's a tricky part of the code. This also doesn't improve anything for single-span traces (as there's no redundant indexing),\n### How this is configured\n\nYou can configure this via the [CassandraStorage](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/zipkin-storage/cassandra/src/main/java/zipkin/storage/cassandra/CassandraStorage.java) or by environment variables (if using zipkin-server).\n- `CASSANDRA_INDEX_CACHE_MAX`: Maximum trace index metadata entries to cache. Zero disables caching. Defaults to 100000.\n- `CASSANDRA_INDEX_CACHE_TTL`: How many seconds to cache index metadata about a trace. Defaults to 60.\n### When this works best\n\nThis particularly helps when traces with a lot of spans touch a small amount of services. It helps even more when the cardinality of annotation or binary annotation values are small (ex http.method = \"GET\").\n\nThis removes extra requests when a collector receives a large amount of span data for a single trace. That could be the case when one or more of the following are true:\n- instrumentation bundles all local spans in a trace into the same message\n- traces are routed consistently to a collector using this storage component\n- there's only one collector\n### What this costs\n\nThis costs memory, as it caches the state of index rows that this storage component wrote. Unless your annotations are very large, the overhead of default settings should be orders of tens of megabytes heap.\n### Example\n\nHere's results from running [brave's example](https://github.com/openzipkin/brave-resteasy-example)\n\n```\n2016-07-07 20:43:53.744 DEBUG 89424 --- [nio-9411-exec-1] zipkin.storage.cassandra.TraceIndexer    : optimized out 2/4 inserts

adds the following properties, which help control the scalability\nof Zipkin's index in Elasticsearch.\n\n```\n* `ES_INDEX_SHARDS`: The number of shards to split the index into. Each shard and its replicas\n                     are assigned to a machine in the cluster. Increasing the number of shards\n                     and machines in the cluster will improve read and write performance. Number\n                     of shards cannot be changed for existing indices, but new daily indices\n                     will pick up changes to the setting. Defaults to 5.\n* `ES_INDEX_REPLICAS`: The number of replica copies of each shard in the index. Each shard and\n                       its replicas are assigned to a machine in the cluster. Increasing the\n                       number of replicas and machines in the cluster will improve read\n                       performance, but not write performance. Number of replicas can be changed\n                       for existing indices. Defaults to 1. It is highly discouraged to set this\n                       to 0 as it would mean a machine failure results in data

a test where 100 single-span messages are sent to Kafka at the\nsame time, I noticed only 58-97 of them would end up in storage\neventhough all messages parsed properly and no operations failed.\n\nAfter a 100ms/message pause was added, the store rate of this test went\nto 100%, so figured it was some sort of state issue. I noticed the code\nwas using Bulk operations regardless of input size, so as a wild guess\nchanged the special-case single-span messages. At least in this test, it\nraised the success rate to 100% without any pausing needed.\n\nI don't know why this worked, but it seems sensible to not use bulk apis\nwhen there's no bulk action to perform.\n\nI started to write a unit test to validate single-length lists don't use\nbulk, but the Mockito involved became too verbose as the Elasticsearch\nclient uses chaining and other patterns that are tedious to mock.\n\nInstead, we should make a parallel integration test and apply them to\nall storage components.\n\nSee

https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/.\n\nNot crazy about the path, but adding new controllers into /metrics/\\* seems like more complexity than needed.\n","created_at":"2016-06-24T14:01:12Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T15:45:33Z","closed_at":"2016-06-28T01:03:46Z","merged_at":"2016-06-28T01:03:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"401ed0292e6465f2ecb2c635eb9238eff93e4bd1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/1144/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/1144/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1144/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/statuses/0e0cb350430111adf87dd2ae6874e683d982be66","head":{"label":"klette:prometheus-metrics","ref":"prometheus-metrics","sha":"0e0cb350430111adf87dd2ae6874e683d982be66","user":{"login":"klette","id":88143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette","html_url":"https://github.com/klette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61887774,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTg4Nzc3NA==","name":"zipkin","full_name":"klette/zipkin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"klette","id":88143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette","html_url":"https://github.com/klette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/klette/zipkin","description":"Zipkin
