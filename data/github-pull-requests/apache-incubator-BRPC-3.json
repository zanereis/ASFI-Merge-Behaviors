What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\n#### Issue Number:\r\n#2430\r\n#### Problem Summary:\r\n`IOBuf` is brpc's buffer type, which is designed to be compatible with many forms of the underlying data. For example, the `append_user_data` can append a piece of user data into an `IOBuf` without making any copy.\r\n\r\nBut this interface still has a limitation. Because it accepts deleter of type `void(*)(void*)` only, so that the deleter is unable to save any state or context.\r\n\r\nAssume that the user uses a custom memory resource, such as c++17's pmr or some implementations of arena. User requests a large chunk of memory at once, then allocates the memory block monotonically from this chunk. It won't releases any memory unless the chunk is exhausted and all the allocated blocks are marked as \"deleted\". The usage `std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource` could have such behaviour.\r\n\r\nHowever, currently since the deleter cannot carry state or context. It's impossible to perceive whether such a memory resource can be released. Because we cannot notify the owner of the resource that the last reference on that memory resource has been freed and the memory can now be released.\r\n\r\nIOBuf是brpc通用的buffer类型，它被设计为可以兼容多种可能的底层数据形式。比如append_user_data接口可以将用户的一段数据拼接到IOBuf中而不产生任何拷贝。\r\n\r\n但是这个接口仍然存在局限性。因为它接受的delete仅为void(void*)类型，这导致deleter无法保存任何状态或者上下文。\r\n\r\n设想用户使用了一种自定义的内存资源，比如c++17的pmr或者自己实现的arena。用户一次性申请了大块内存，然后将该内存块线性分配给不同的请求，当内存块耗尽且所有分配出去的内存都被标记为释放时时再一次性释放。std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource的使用就可能存在这样的行为。\r\n\r\n然而由于deleter无法携带状态或者上下文，因此程序无法感知到何时内存资源可以被释放。因为我们无法在deleter中通知资源的持有者，最后一个在该内存资源上的引用已经被释放，现在可以回收内存了。\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\n#### Changed:\r\n把`UserDataDeleter `的类型替换为`std::function`.\r\n#### Side effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n  `std::function`可以本地存储函数指针（small object optimization，取决于编译器，但是较新版本的gcc和clang都有实现）。对于已经存在的使用函数指针的代码的性能影响几乎可以忽略不计。overhead只存在于影响了编译器内联。\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n不破坏任何已有功能。\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n`DirReaderPosix` 析构时关闭只应调用 `closedir(dir_)` ， 不应同时调用 `close(fd_)`, 否则会导致同一个 `fd` 被close 两次。\r\n\r\n> Upon\tcalling\tclosedir() the file descriptor is closed. \r\n\r\nhttps://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fdopendir&sektion=3\r\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fdopendir.html\r\n\r\nPoC : \r\n如果在 `close(fd_)` 和 `closedir(dir_)` 之间有新的 `open` 操作，`fd_` 可能会被复用，则 `closedir(dir_)` 导致该新 open 的 `fd_` 失效，后续对 `fd_` 的操作将会导致 `errno = 9 (Bad File Descriptor)` 错误。\r\n\r\nps: 实际情况可能是在多个线程中触发，这里以单线程代码说明：\r\n\r\n``` c++\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n#include <dirent.h>\r\n#include <fcntl.h>\r\n#include <stdint.h>\r\n#include <stdlib.h>\r\n#include <errno.h>\r\n#include <unistd.h>\r\n#include <assert.h>\r\n#include <string.h>\r\n\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\r\n{\r\n    DIR *d;\r\n    struct dirent *dp;\r\n    int dfd = 0;\r\n\r\n    if ((d = fdopendir((dfd = open(\"./tmp\", O_RDONLY)))) == NULL) {\r\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Cannot open ./tmp directory\\n\");\r\n       exit(1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // close dfd first,  dfd = 3.\r\n    close(dfd); \r\n\r\n    // then open a new file, ffd maybe be reused, ffd = 3.\r\n    int ffd = open(\"./tmp/testfile\", O_RDONLY); \r\n    assert(ffd > 0);\r\n\r\n    closedir(d); // note this implicitly closes dfd = 3, so ffd is invalid. \r\n    \r\n    // read ffd would be failed.\r\n    int rc = read(ffd, 0, 2);\r\n    if(rc < 0) {\r\n        printf(\"Read failed, error %d (%s)\\n\", errno, strerror(errno)); // errno = 9.\r\n    }\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n ~DirReaderUnix()  中只需调用 `closedir(dir_)` 即可.\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\nNo\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\nNo\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number: https://github.com/apache/brpc/issues/1255 https://github.com/apache/brpc/issues/2167\r\n\r\nProblem Summary: Support bRPC compile with [boringssl](https://github.com/google/boringssl)\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n增加兼容函数：\r\n - `AddBIOBuffer`, boringssl 没有 `BIO_f_buffer` 函数， 使用 `BIO_s_mem` 代替\r\n - boringssl 未提供 `get_rfc2409_prime_xxx` 等一些函数，需要使用 sssl_compat.h 中提供的。\r\n - boringssl 未提供 BIO_fd_non_fatal_error ，需要加入 ssl_compat.h 中。\r\n\r\n目前仅支持 CMake/Bazel 的编译方式\r\n支持的 boringssl 版本 [fips-20210429](https://github.com/google/boringssl/releases/tag/fips-20210429)\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n 无\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n 无\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor Covenant Code of

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n一个要解决的问题是 brpc worker 线程多的时候，由于大量的 signal_task 导致的性能雪崩。我们观察到 bthread_concurrency 多了后大量的 cpu 都会花费在 TaskContro::signal_task 以及 ParkingLot::signal 上，更具体是 ParkingLot::_pending_signal 这个原子变量上。signal_task 是一个热点函数，在每次发生 bthread 切换，新的 bthread 创建，以及等待中的 bthread 恢复执行时都会被调用；而 brpc 当前的 signal_task 的实现比较粗糙，每次 signal_task 都无差别地遍历对 parkinglot 做 signal，_pending_signal 的自增成为巨大的热点，会占用整体超过一半的 cpu。\r\n这是我们在64核机器上 bthread_concurrency 设置为48时的 cpu profiling:\r\n<img width=\"485\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-16 at 12 14 53\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/brpc/assets/26199910/c0e5801a-027f-481a-82e2-f022a5a54940\">\r\n\r\n就像代码注释里所说，\r\n\r\n> Current algorithm does not guarantee enough threads will be created to match caller's requests. But in another side, there's also many useless signalings according to current impl. Capping the concurrency is a good balance between performance and timeliness of scheduling.\r\n\r\n针对 worker 唤醒，做的改动就是记录在 parkinglot 上等待的 worker num，只有有 worker 等待时才 signal_task；另外就是 steal_task 时让 worker 在 wait 在 parking lot 之前 busy poll 一小段时间，不那么频繁地 wait。\r\n\r\n另外一个改动就是对于重新唤醒的 task 的处理。我们的场景 RPC bthread 会等待我们的 service 处理然后被唤醒，现有的 butex_wake 实现中虽然 brpc 的 worker 线程会立即切换到被唤醒的 bthread，但非 worker pthread 调用 butex_wake 只会把被唤醒的 bthread 给放进优先级很低的 _remote_rq。我们认为被唤醒的应该优先被处理，所以每个 TaskGroup 引入了额外的 _resume_rq 来保存由外部 pthread 唤醒的 bthread，在 wait_task 中优先检查。\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\n目前brpc会将连接池里空闲的连接关闭，这样对于比较低频的rpc来说，如果rpc周期大于FLAGS_idle_timeout_second，那每次都要新建连接，不太友好。\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\n支持连接池保留至少一个空闲连接。\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor

的问题主要是：\r\n（1）太多无关topic的改动\r\n（2）仅在SendRpcResponse成功时才调用call_after_rpc_resp函数，失败时没有调用（我们需要无论成功或失败都要调用）\r\n（3）定义的after_resp_fn_t不包含controller指针，我们需要拿到controller对象（进而拿到session data指针，所以声明为非const指针）\r\n3.同样在目前在常用的 baidu_std/http/http2 协议上支持。其他协议未开发。\r\n4.将Controller与req、res的析构顺序进行了修改，依赖关系应该是controller依赖req、res，所以应该先析构controller，后析构req、res\r\n\r\n麻烦maintainers看看有什么不妥之处~\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-25T13:41:49Z","updated_at":"2023-12-21T03:17:19Z","closed_at":"2023-10-25T07:01:45Z","merged_at":"2023-10-25T07:01:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"e1a88638fb5028262396d0e6d687e66c5abd4da2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/2328/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/2328/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/2328/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/statuses/de53f4d9c91a6613a85739291509bb817744f333","head":{"label":"yockie:call_after_rpc_resp","ref":"call_after_rpc_resp","sha":"de53f4d9c91a6613a85739291509bb817744f333","user":{"login":"yockie","id":2568971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Njg5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2568971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie","html_url":"https://github.com/yockie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":226692083,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjY2OTIwODM=","name":"incubator-brpc","full_name":"yockie/incubator-brpc","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yockie","id":2568971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Njg5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2568971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie","html_url":"https://github.com/yockie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yockie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yockie/incubator-brpc","description":"Industrial-grade

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\n`FlatMap` 中 `Bucket` 的 `Element` 用于存放用户的 key 和 value，初始化 element 的空间（`element_space`) 地址要满足 Element 的对齐要求。\r\n\r\n未修改前，可以看到 element_space 的起始地值，并未满足 Element 的对齐要求：\r\n```\r\n   249      struct Bucket {\r\n   250          explicit Bucket(const _K& k) : next(NULL)\r\n-> 251          { new (element_spaces) Element(k); }\r\n...\r\n(lldb) p &element_spaces\r\n(char (*)[128]) $1 = 0x0000000000385428\r\n(lldb) p alignof(Element)\r\n(unsigned long) $2 = 16\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n> 5.3.4 New [expr.new] \r\n    [14] Note: when the allocation function returns a value other than null, it must be a pointer to a block of storage in which space for the object has been reserved. The block of storage is assumed to be appropriately aligned and of the requested size.\r\n\r\n一些编译器在开启优化选项后，会根据数据的对齐字节，而选择更高效的指令，例如 `movaps`, 如果实际的数据未按照其对齐要求分配内存，则会导致错误发生。\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n采用 `std::aligned_storage<sizeof(Element), alignof(Element)>` 用于初始化 `element_space`.\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n无\r\n- Breaking

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #1328 \r\n\r\nProblem Summary: \r\nWhen using thrift version greater than 0.13.0, brpc can't compile correctly due to deprecate of boost.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\nNow compile logic works as follow:\r\nFor version < 0.11, set _THRIFT_VERSION_LOWER_THAN_0_11_0_ in cmake and using boost\r\nFor 0.11 <= version < 0.13, _THRIFT_STDCXX_H_ is set inside thrift/stdcxx.h and use apache::thrift::stdcxx\r\nFor later, just use std\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\nNo\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\nNo, later version of thrift use std as well.\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor Covenant Code of

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\n高版本编译器编译的brpc，用户异常抛到brpc框架内部导致core栈不完整\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n[程序内部core但是core栈不完整 #1997](https://github.com/apache/brpc/issues/1997)\r\n[运行一段时间，就会core在brpc内部 #1437](https://github.com/apache/brpc/issues/1437)\r\n[crash #985](https://github.com/apache/brpc/issues/985)\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n高版本GCC编译器(如GCC12)对于析构函数默认是noexcept的（也有人说是因为C++标准的问题 比如C++11之后才默认noexcept，但是GCC12下我使用C++11和C++17都是默认noexcept的）, 低版本的GCC82默认就是noexcept（false）的。\r\n\r\n所以当你使用了高版本GCC编译程序的时候，业务代码抛出异常，在进行栈回溯之前会先沿着调用栈寻找处理异常的代码块(专业名词是Landing pad)，如果找到Landing pad，那么就会进行栈回溯到Landing pad进行异常处理。找不到Landing pad就会原地调用std::terminate终止程序，这个时候你的core栈就是完整的，不会回溯陷入brpc框架。\r\n\r\n从我的测试看，Landing pad 一种是真正的 try catch 块，另一种就是整个调用链上有noexcept属性的函数结束的代码段地址(汇编代码就是一块Unwind_Resume代码块)，brpc整个调用链上没有try catch 非 bthread::ExitException 异常的Landing pad。 所以我hook了__gxx_personality_v0函数，找出了具有noexcept属性的函数\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/brpc/assets/45502185/3befe00e-328b-438d-95bb-4a97ef945941)\r\n\r\n修改这个析构函数为noexcept(false)之后，__gxx_personality_v0就在brpc框架内找不到Landing pad代码块了，于是就会在抛异常的地方终止，堆栈也就完整了\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #1991\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\nIn HTTP/2 standard a client should negotiate the protocol with server with ALPN. The client should send a list of protocols it support and the server will choose one. Normally `curl` sends `http1.1` and `h2`. A standard client should send H2 requests in TLS payload only if the server chooses `h2` in ALPN.\r\n\r\nWe tried a deployment with Nginx (TLS termination and `grpc_pass` to backend) in front of BRPC and found Nginx is treating BRPC client's H2 payload as H1 since there's no ALPN. It's confirmed that adding client side ALPN fixes it.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, if `options.alpn_protocols` is set in SSL options, the client will send ALPN extension during SSL handshake and check if the server responded with a acceptable protocol name. Normally we could set `alpn_protocols` to `{\"h2\"}` to only use H2. Note that the implementation will raise an error if the server returns no ALPN selection or unacceptable ALPN selection. Currently BRPC has no server side ALPN support (until #2102 is merged) so using this option with no HTTPS reverse proxy in front of BRPC server will not work.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// Example to work with \"h2:grpc\" protocol\r\nchannel_options.mutable_ssl_options()->alpn_protocols = {\"h2\"};\r\n```\r\n\r\nClient side ALPN must be set manually since it requires server side ALPN support. By default it's unset and the behavior is like without this feature.\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响): If the client side ALPN feature is used, a little more memory allocations are happened during client side SSL connection setup and handshake.\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): No effect\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor Covenant Code of
