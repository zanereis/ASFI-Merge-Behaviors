Not aggregated by topic.\r\n\r\nThe following metrics related to transactional messages have been added:\r\n1. `rocketmq_half_messages`, GAUGE, records the number of half messages in transactional scenarios, aggregated by topic.\r\n2. `rocketmq_commit_messages_total`, COUNTER, records the number of messages committed in transactions, aggregated by topic.\r\n4. `rocketmq_rollback_messages_total`, COUNTER, records the number of messages rolled back in transactions, aggregated by topic.\r\n5. `rocketmq_transaction_finish_latency`, HISTOGRAM, records the distribution of delay times for committing transactional half messages, aggregated by topic.\r\n\r\nIn addition, to calculate metrics related to transactional messages, a new data structure called TransactionMetrics has been added to record the number of transactional half messages under each topic.\r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to ensure the code quality of

Which Issue(s) This PR Fixes\r\n\r\n<!--fix-->\r\n\r\nFixes #7484\r\n\r\n### Brief Description\r\n\r\nWhen using this line of code to test UtilAllTest#testCalculateFileSizeInPath:\r\n`mvn -pl common test -Dtest=org.apache.rocketmq.common.UtilAllTest#testCalculateFileSizeInPath\r\n`\r\nAn error would occur. \r\nPart of the error message: \r\n```\r\nTests run: 1, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.785 sec <<< FAILURE! - in org.apache.rocketmq.common.UtilAllTest\r\ntestCalculateFileSizeInPath(org.apache.rocketmq.common.UtilAllTest)  Time elapsed: 0.641 sec  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<0> but was:<5252>\r\n\tat org.apache.rocketmq.common.UtilAllTest.testCalculateFileSizeInPath(UtilAllTest.java:242)\r\n\r\nResults :\r\n\r\nFailed tests: \r\n  UtilAllTest.testCalculateFileSizeInPath:242 expected:<0> but was:<5252>\r\n```\r\nThe related original code: \r\n```\r\nString basePath = System.getProperty(\"java.io.tmpdir\") + File.separator + \"testCalculateFileSizeInPath\";\r\nFile baseFile = new File(basePath);\r\n// test empty path\r\nassertEquals(0, UtilAll.calculateFileSizeInPath(baseFile));\r\n```\r\nThe error message shows the size of the \"empty\" path that the code creates is not zero, which means the path is not empty. After careful examination of the code, I have found that the occurrence of this issue is certain and persistent. When we run the code for the first time, nothing happens, and the build succeeds. However, after that, because the path names in the code remain unchanged, this path becomes non-empty every time we build. As a result, an error occurs every time it is run.\r\nSo we need to change part of the code to make sure the temporary path we created is empty everytime.\r\n\r\nSo I import `java.util.UUID`, and used `String uniqueDirName = UUID.randomUUID().toString();` to create a unique and random id, and add this id to the end of the path: `String basePath = System.getProperty(\"java.io.tmpdir\") + File.separator + uniqueDirName;` This makes every temp path the function creates is unique. \r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n\r\nAfter the modification, the test will not fail anymore. I used the same test: \r\n`mvn -pl common test -Dtest=org.apache.rocketmq.common.UtilAllTest#testCalculateFileSizeInPath`\r\nto test the UtilAllTest.java, and it builds success.

`testCalculateFileSizeInPath` needs and then recursively deleting it, it uses JUnit's `TemporaryFolder` `@Rule` to handle all of this work, and allows the code to concentrate on the business logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n\r\nRunning `mvn install` passes now, as well as running this test manually from

In most case, the target branch should be `develop`. -->\r\n\r\n### Which Issue(s) This PR Fixes\r\n\r\n在编辑的时候，如果当前已存在account，执行updateAccountMap = createAclAccessConfigMap(account, plainAccessConfig);\r\n该条语句时，会将原来的account重新获取，并且将新的内容set到account中，形成新的updateAccountMap 的account信息。\r\n这就导致了，如果在编辑的时候执行的命令不填写-w，会导致plainAccessConfig为null，进而不会将原来的account中的whiteRemoteAddress设置为空，导致上述问题。\r\n解决方案\r\n1：将account设置为null，直接存命令行输入的内容\r\n\r\nFixes #7361 \r\n\r\n### Brief

-->\r\n\r\nFixes #7300 \r\n### Brief Description\r\n\r\nUse [JRaft](https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-jraft) to Implement Controller.\r\n\r\n#### New Configuration\r\n```text\r\n# 可选 jRaft、DLedger，默认 DLedger\r\ncontrollerType=jRaft\r\n\r\n# jRaft 相关\r\n# 选举超时时间，默认 1 秒\r\njRaftElectionTimeoutMs=1000\r\n# 进行 Snapshot 的间隔，默认 1 小时，此处建议更长的时间，如 1 天、3 天\r\njRaftSnapshotIntervalSecs=3600\r\n# group id\r\njRaftGroupId=jRaft-Controller\r\n# 本机 jraft 的地址\r\njRaftServerId=localhost:9880\r\n# jraft 组的地址\r\njRaftInitConf=localhost:9880,localhost:9881,localhost:9882\r\n# jRaft Controller 中，jRaft 与 提供给 Broker 的 RPCService 不共用套接字资源，下面设置的是 Controller 上监听 Broker RPC 的端口。注意 IP 与端口要与 jRaftInitConf 一一对应。\r\njRaftControllerRPCAddr=localhost:9770,localhost:9771,localhost:9772\r\n```\r\n#### Design\r\nOn the Broker side, the JRaft Controller did not make any modifications and continued to use all the designs and concepts of DLedger Controller, such as Epoch and SyncStateSet.\r\nOn the Controller side, JRaft Controller not only migrated, but also refactored the original components and code logic, not only supporting SnapShot functionality, but also solving the unreasonable aspects of the original design, making the Controller conform to linear consistency.\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n\r\nUse [Openchaos](https://github.com/openmessaging/openchaos) to test it.\r\n<!-- In order to ensure the code quality of Apache RocketMQ, we expect every pull request to have undergone thorough testing.
