SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n- api endpoint `/api/v1/database/schemas` for fetching list of schemas.\r\n- adds SIP-34 filters to datasets list view\r\n- removes `LIST_VIEWS_SIP34_FILTER_UI` feature flag\r\n- enabled SIP-34 filters for datasts, charts, dashboards, listview\r\n- moves `src/views/*` -> `src/views/CRUD/*` (eg, `src/views/datasetList/DatasetList.tsx` -> `src/views/CRUD/dataset/DatasetList.tsx` ) -- idea being that `src/views/CRUD` namespace can share code, ie, data fetching logic, state hooks, edit modals, delete modals, etc\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n<img width=\"843\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-07-15 at 6 46 41 PM\"

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds [Facebook Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) as an optional dependency to enable time series forecasting in viz plugins. For each series (=column), it will add three new columns with the following suffix:\r\n- `__yhat`: forecast\r\n- `__yhat_lower`: lower confidence level\r\n- `__yhat_upper`: uper confidence level\r\nIn addition, it extrapolates as many time grain steps into the future as have been specified in the `periods` parameter. For instance, 52 periods with weekly time grains will create a forecast of 52 weekly observations = 1 year into the future. The forecast along with confidence intervals will be made available for the whole time period, while the observations (without a suffix) will be null for the forecasted dates. For more details please refer to the [excellent tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#python-api) by the Prophet team.\r\n\r\nThis treats each series as an individual time series model, hence will be computationally very expensive in the case of multiple columns. However, since the new chart data endpoint caches the end result, only the first calculation will be slow.\r\n\r\nI've tried to add as many different tests as possible (schema validation, post processing, e2e API test) to ensure functionality. The end-to-end tests require `fbprophet` to be installed, however I decided against adding it to `requirements-dev.txt`, as it will make CI much more sluggish. However, anyone interested in developing this feature further can install the dependency locally and activate the e2e tests that are otherwise skipped.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI + new

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds [Facebook Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) as an optional dependency to enable time series forecasting in viz plugins. For each series (=column), it will add three new columns with the following suffix:\r\n- `__yhat`: forecast\r\n- `__yhat_lower`: lower confidence level\r\n- `__yhat_upper`: uper confidence level\r\nIn addition, it extrapolates as many time grain steps into the future as have been specified in the `periods` parameter. For instance, 52 periods with weekly time grains will create a forecast 52 weeks = 1 year into the future. The forecast along with confidence intervals will be made available for the whole time period, while the observations (without a suffix) will be null for the forecasted dates. For more details please refer to the [excellent tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#python-api) by the Prophet team.\r\n\r\nThis treats each series as an individual time series model, hence will be computationally very expensive in the case of multiple columns. However, since the new chart data endpoint caches the end result, only the first calculation will be slow.\r\n\r\nI've tried to add as many different tests as possible (schema validation, post processing, e2e API test) to ensure functionality. The end-to-end tests require `fbprophet` to be installed, however I decided against adding it to `requirements-dev.txt`, as it will make CI much more sluggish. However, anyone interested in developing this feature further can install the dependency locally and activate the e2e tests that are otherwise skipped.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI + new tests\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR introduces the same concept used on dashboards `ModelView`'s for changed_on humanised text. Has reported on #10307 humanised dates differ from the API dashboard response and the MVC list `ModelView`.\r\nDashboard `ModelView` is always correct because it computes the timestamp humanised delta on the server, and the server is always coherent with itself since it automatically timestamps the `changed_on` and `created_on` fields and computes the humanised delta at the server side.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces this concept to the API, and adds a `changed_on_utc` that assumes servers are always on UTC. Note that we are not submitting TZ dates to the backend and this should be later addressed\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"1174\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-07-15 at

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nSuperset has been running in quirks mode due to a lack of DOCTYPE tag. This adds the DOCTYPE, which causes various CSS issues. This code also fixes that CSS. CSS fixes led to some Emotion styles, removing some JS-calculated dimensions, leaning on Flexbox more, and removing at least one Bootstrap Panel component. Hopefully we can continue to simplify and speed up rendering using these techniques. UI should remain effectively unchanged. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nMade a change along the way, to have control panels scroll _within_ the control tabs, so you don't have to scroll all the way up to switch tabs. Been meaning to do this forever anyway. Here's the AFTER gif:\r\n![scroll](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/88855079-30ff4200-d1a7-11ea-91a9-a9b9e38aa6c5.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nTL;DR: this makes viz plugins behave in the same way as legacy viz plugins when the request fails or returns no data.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the following problems in the chart data endpoint:\r\n- if no data was returned, the chart would not render, leaving the old chart on screen, potentially even an incorrect chart type. This was due to the legacy endpoint returning a 200 with empty data, as opposed to the new endpoint returning a 200 response with an error field but without a data field. To harmonize behavior, `QueryContext` was updated to return a non-error response with an empty data field for empty result sets.\r\n- The `error_message` property of `QueryResult` was not being populated for failed requests in SQLA model, leading to the `error` field on `QueryObject` always being `None`.\r\n- Errors were not picked up from `QueryObject`s when calling the chart data endpoint. This meant that erroneous requests were returned as 200s with an error-field that was not handled in any way, causing the chart to render in unexpected ways. Now the `error` field is is checked for each response dataset; if a single one is defined, a 400 is returned (these are mostly expected to be incorrect SQL).\r\n- The error message from erroneous requests (=incorrect request schema) were not displayed, making it difficult to see in the frontend what the problem was.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nWhen no data is returned, the chart data endpoint returns a response that the `Chart` component can properly identify as an empty response. Previously this left the previous rendered state visible.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/87297393-05c2f480-c511-11ea-95a4-148254a09090.png)\r\n\r\nWhen an incorrect request is performed, the error message is displayed, making debugging easier. Previously only \"An error occurred.\" was displayed (please note that the error in this screenshot has been fixed by #10299).\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/87297616-681bf500-c511-11ea-939b-e05f48b2c193.png)\r\n\r\nWhen an a query is incorrect, the error is displayed in the warning (previously this would print \"An error occurred while rendering the visualization: TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined\")

SUMMARY\r\nIntroduce case insensitive validation of filter operators in chart data schemas, as filter operators are made uppercase in both Druid and SQLA connectors, hence case isn't a concern for queries. The custom validators are moved to `utils/schema.py` as they will likely be relevant in other endpoints, too.\r\n\r\nCurrently the cases of filter operators are inconsistent: some are all uppercase, others all lowercase. I considered unifying those, but it would have introduced risk of regression, so will save that for a separate PR after 0.37.0 has shipped.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nTable chart has stopped using the default time column due to recent refactor to control utils (#10224, #10264, #10284). Other charts somehow weren't impacted.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that `mapStateToProps` for the Time Column control will update `control.default` that wasn't picked by the re-run of `mapStateToProps` in `getInitialState`.\r\n\r\nRefactored `applyMapStateToPropsToControl` so that everything the map function updates `default` or `value`, it will always be picked up by `getControlState`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nGo create a new table chart with a datasource that has a time column.\r\n\r\nBefore: default time column (the first temporal column) is not populated\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/87255810-cded7b80-c442-11ea-8ef3-bb8188296114.png\" width=\"400\">\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter: default time column should be

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhenever one uses the `superset` CLI with the thumbnail feature disabled (which is behind a feature flag), one would see the following warning, \r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO:superset.utils.logging_configurator:logging was configured successfully\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/flask_caching/__init__.py:189: UserWarning: Flask-Caching: CACHE_TYPE is set to null, caching is effectively disabled.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was in related to the `THUMBNAIL_CACHE_CONFIG` which is unused but has a default configuration of \r\n\r\n```python\r\nTHUMBNAIL_CACHE_CONFIG = {\"CACHE_TYPE\": \"null\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fix is merely to disable the warning for said cache.\r\n\r\nNote that the `CACHE_CONFIG` and `TABLE_NAMES_CACHE_CONFIG` are initialized as `{\"CACHE_TYPE\": \"null\"}` however the difference is the intent is for them to for these to by overridden as they are critical for non-feature flag aspects of the application.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nAdds functionality to import plugins dynamically. A corresponding plugin can be found here: https://github.com/apache-superset/dynamic-import-demo-plugin\r\n\r\nGoals:\r\n- Allow third parties to create plugins without changing Superset code\r\n- Allow users of Superset to add new chart types without backend access\r\n- Allow plugin authors to use whatever languages and code styles they prefer\r\n- Work towards a future improved contract between superset and third-party code.\r\n- Open the door to developing a future ‚Äúapp store‚Äù so that plugins can be conveniently searched and installed at the press of a button\r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\n- Plugin author starts with the template repo with a structure similar to existing plugins. Builds a bundle using Webpack.\r\n- Shared packages (react, lodash, @superset-ui) are provided superset-side and are referenced as externals from Webpack.\r\n- Bundle is hosted somewhere on the web - CDN, github etc. The plugin has `serve` command to help with local development.\r\n- Use the new Custom Plugin UI in Superset (under the \"Manage\" menu) to add the plugin to Superset.\r\n\r\nVarious hacks were necessary to build a PoC, but I believe they can all be solved with some kind of arcane webpack incantation:\r\n- Assigning modules to namespaced global objects to support a plugin's external dependencies instead of an actual dependency management system\r\n- Can‚Äôt async import from inside the plugin\r\n- Images/other assets. How do we load them if we don't know where the plugin is going to be hosted? Currently using url-loader with limit: Infinity, which works but is kinda sad.\r\n-  I'm still tracking down all the places in Superset that need to change to respect async import of plugins.\r\n\r\nI'd greatly appreciate any help addressing these issues, or any feedback on the code that anyone has!\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\n- toggle on the feature flag\r\n- run the example plugin linked above\r\n- add the example plugin from the \"Plugins\" settings nav menu item.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [x] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [x] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-10T21:12:39Z","updated_at":"2024-02-19T00:35:25Z","closed_at":"2020-12-19T15:06:12Z","merged_at":"2020-12-19T15:06:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"b5dd0f32cca167740a02d702b1ef1865232b3d80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nytai","id":10255196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjU1MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10255196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai","html_url":"https://github.com/nytai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1127990345,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTI3OTkwMzQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/risk:db-migration","name":"risk:db-migration","color":"e67e22","default":false,"description":"PRs

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFollow up for #10283 .\r\n\r\nEven after re-enable the \"Edit datasource\" menu item, the datasource edit modal doesn't actually update current control state---users have to refresh the page to see their datasource updated. This is because the `actions` object passed to `mapStateToProps` is not the actual reducer dispatch function, but the methods to generate dispatch payload.\r\n\r\nThe functionality was broken because #10224 and #10264 simplified how `mapStateToProps` is called and removed `actions` from `mapStateToProps`'s signature. Since `DatasourceControl` is the only place where `actions` dispatchers are needed for `mapStateToProps`, and all controls actually [already accepts `actions` as props](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/700429f431d20b624e886cf554b2b493793448be/superset-frontend/src/explore/components/ControlPanelsContainer.jsx#L95), it makes sense to keep the function simple and refactor `DatasourceControl` instead.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n1. Edit a datasource. We recommend start from a table chart.\r\n2. After saving the datasource, you should be able to see the changes to datasource columns, metrics, etc in the controls without refreshing the page.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAt Airbnb we had an incident with Celery where tasks weren't being picked up and the CPU was pegged at close to 100%. We configure Celery with the `gevent` pool and the only workaround to remedy the problem was to restart the workers sans `gevent`. \r\n\r\nWe haven't been able to track down the root cause of the problem, though a Google search surfaced a similar [issue](https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/4999) (though we actually don't call `AsyncResult.get()` since the SQL Lab results are stored elsewhere) which I believe was fixed in `4.4.2` (which is the version Superset currently uses). The issue seems to be that there are no [release note](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/changelog.html) associated with said release nor does that tag exist within the Celery GitHub repo. Given there have been a number of recent releases (which mostly look like bug fixes) I felt it was prudent that we bumped the version of Celery to the latest stable version.\r\n\r\nNote we use a MySQL database for Superset and historically have been using the `mysqlclient` DBAPI but we're looking into using `PyMySQL` which fully supports `gevent`. We're not sure if this was the issue, but the Celery workers poll certain async engines, i.e., Presto, every few seconds per task and thus having a fully `gevent` compliant DBAPI may also be benefical.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPer the Celery [documentation](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/reference/celery.result.html#celery-result) in relation to Celery results, \r\n\r\n> **Warning:**\r\nBackends use resources to store and transmit results. To ensure that resources are released, you must eventually call `get()` or `forget()` on EVERY AsyncResult instance returned after calling a task.\r\n\r\nwhich we aren't doing. Given we actually don't store the SQL Lab payloads in the Celery results backend, holding onto these task result metadata for [24 hours](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#result-expires) isn't a major concern, however this can result in having thousands of redundant records (at Airbnb we have in excess of 10,000 keys which could be retired). It seems fairly trivial to clean as we go.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nMove the table viz to API v1.  Depends on https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/889\r\n\r\nAlso did a bunch of refactoring on `QueryContext` and `QueryObject`:\r\n\r\n1. Rename `DbColumnTypes` to `GenericDataType`\r\n2. Add `colnames` and `coltypes` to query response. Didn't call them `column_names` to make it easier to search in the code.\r\n3. Support `DTTM_ALIAS` in groupby/columns\r\n4. Add a query context validation function, which runs more advanced validation on query context parameters before running the query. Currently only checks for duplicate column labels.\r\n5. Update `post_processing.contribution` to support applying contribution only on selected columns (needed for percent metrics).\r\n\r\nBumped `superset-ui` packages and plugins to `0.17.0`:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/compare/v0.16.9...v0.17.0\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI and manual verification.\r\n\r\n- Make sure major charts don't break.\r\n- Remember to test other charts that uses API v1, including word cloud, echarts, etc.\r\n \r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe issue was first observed in #7270\r\nHowever, in the subsequent releases, the variable time_grain_functions was renamed to _time_grain_expressions.

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the pivot operation doesn't work properly on the chart data endpoint due to column names being `Tuple[str, ...]`, causing `json.dumps` to fail. This adds the option to flatten the column names in a similar manner to how `viz.py` does it (drop metric name if only single metric present, join column names with comma etc). In addition, the index is returned to the DataFrame as a regular column to keep the pivot output uniform with other post processing operations. The `columns` argument is also made optional to avoid having to do an additional ternary in `buildQuery` when building time series viz plugins with optional groupbys.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI + new

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWe wanted to update the color of the superset logo. I'm not sure why the existing one had a white stroke, so I used a rasterization of the SVG logo from `superset-frontent/branding`. \r\n\r\nDue to the slightly different size/aspect ratio (which... I actually like), the vertical alignment was a hair off. I added some styles (using Emotion, rather than adding to the LESS codebase) to vertically center logos of any size.\r\n\r\nNote that the styles (and thus these screenshots) are for the React menu. I don't _think_ the FAB-generated nav bar is viewable any more, unless I'm mistaken. @nytai could you confirm?\r\n\r\nAreas of feature-creep I'm ignoring for this PR, but might circle back to:\r\n1) Menu.jsx -> Menu.tsx\r\n2) Removing any styles/jinja templates relating to the old menu that are not visible in superset anymore \r\n3) Now that Emotion has entered the picture, there are probably various LESS styles that can be migrated in.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis fixes another bug introduced by #10113 : when a chart has frontend validator errors (e.g. empty metrics), it's impossible to clear it without refreshing the page.\r\n\r\nAlso refactored some Cypress tests and did some minor optimization on error collection.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n<img

bug:\r\n\r\n1. Go to Explore a table chart, clear any metrics under in \"Aggregate\" mode if there's any\r\n2. Select \"Raw\" query mode\r\n3. Select some columns\r\n4. Change chart to line chart\r\n5. You should see a validation error on \"metrics\", add a new metric will not clear the error, preventing users from running the query. However, if they run the query and refresh the page, the query can go through.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nA recent upgrade to react-table https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/10113#issuecomment-649855683 changed some of the sorting config used by the listviews (welcome, dashboards, charts, tables/datasets). As a result some columns became sortable that should not have been (eg, in datasets: the type of dataset icon, owners, and type). This PR updates the props to be more in line with what react-table expects which is that any column with an `accessor` property is sortable by default and columns with `disableSortBy` are not sortable. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n- in

sortable\r\n- in welcome (`/superset/welcome`): \"Dashboard\", \"Creator\", and \"Modified\" are sortable.  \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIt seems we pickle the visualization payloads et al. prior to caching via the [Flask-Caching](https://github.com/sh4nks/flask-caching) package, however for all backends as part of the set/get logic the object to cache is pickled and the unpicked respectively, i.e., for Redis the [set](https://github.com/sh4nks/flask-caching/blob/master/flask_caching/backends/rediscache.py#L124) and [get](https://github.com/sh4nks/flask-caching/blob/master/flask_caching/backends/rediscache.py#L113) methods call `dump_object` and `load_object` respectively which in turn calls `pickle.dumps` and `pickle.loads`, hence we were actually double pickling the payloads.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nBump table viz to v0.14.5 (not released yet) to change default query mode from `aggregate` to `null` so it can have better backward compatibility. Currently existing tables in the old `NOT GROUP BY` mode will not open the `Query Mode: Raw` tab by default.\r\n\r\nAccompanying superset-ui PR: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/659\r\n\r\nThis bug was actually captured by #10206, but I was lazy and went with an easier fix.\r\n\r\nUpdate: also fixes #10215 .\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently Superset only show top 1000 options for a dropdown list in filter_box component. If a filter has > 1000 options, user won't see all the options. When user type-in with correct value (space, capital letter etc), the filter value can still get applied. But this experience confused many users. When they didn't see the option from the list, they thought it was not an option.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to enable async searchable options for filter_box in Superset dashboard:\r\n- by default, filter_box only fetch top 1000 options (like right now).\r\n- if enable `Search All Filter Options` and this filter key has >= 1000 options, filter box will load options from a remote source as the user types, with 1000 options per load.\r\n- when user typing in, filter_box is actually sending out a new query with extra sql expression ` WHERE lower(_column_key_) like '_input_value_'`\r\n\r\n<img

SUMMARY\r\nThere are use cases when users would prefer to treat empty strings in the csv as nulls in the database.\r\nThis PR makes the field to be configurable and bring more transparency to how it is handled.\r\nA default value is set to be the same as pandas, it doesn't look pretty and probably has too many values, that's why I also made it configurable.\r\n\r\nDefault values:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5727938/86205273-49375f00-bb1e-11ea-97f9-19eee5811821.png)\r\n\r\nIn addition to the feature, I've refactored hive_tests.py to follow pytest standards, now they can be run directly via pytest command.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n* pytest -s tests/db_engine_specs/hive_tests.py - for hive changes\r\n* tox -e py36 -- tests/core_tests.py::TestCore::test_import_csv - for general changes\r\n* tested locally for different uses case on mysql \r\n* tested on our staging env for hive changes\r\n\r\n### Hive testing

SUMMARY\r\n\r\n#10113 removed `jquer.DataTables` and the webpack hack to make it work for dev servers (`npm run dev`). But it is still used by the Pivot Table chart.\r\n\r\nThis will throw a \"can't access $ of undefined\" error in a clean build.\r\n\r\nThis should have been catched by Cypress tests for

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe `log_this` method logs the payload associated with the request however the existing logic doesn't accurately reflect how the `form_data` field is handled, i.e., it tries to fetch the payload from `request.form` (note I'm unsure why we're not using the `application/json` content type which uses `request.json`) and then override the payload with the request parameters. Note the impetus for this change was I was trying to see how the `explore_json` endpoint was being logged using dashboard filter overrides and realized that the `json` column only contained data of the form (which re-encoded the form-data as a JSON encoded string which seems wrong), \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"form_data\": \"{\\\"slice_id\\\":54}\", \"dashboard_id\": \"6\"}\r\n``` \r\n\r\ni.e., what was parsed in the request parameters and lacked any of the body.\r\n\r\nThis approach seems incorrect when the form-data is encoded as a JSON object within the body or request parameters via the `form_data` key meaning the resulting payload is an override as opposed to merge. The solution here (and I believe the intent of the method) is to leverage the `get_form_data` method (when relevant) which performs a similar merge on the JSON payload associated with the `form_data` key as opposed to the entire payload. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI, tested locally, and added unit
