Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\nFirstly having clause of Mysql is really very complex, we are hard to follow all rules, so we revert [pr15143](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/15143) to keep the logic the same as before.\r\n\r\nSecondly the origin implementation has problem while having clause has multi-conditions.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n1. case1: here `v2` inside having clause use table column `test_having_alias_tb.v2`\r\n\r\n- `SELECT id, v1-2 as v, sum(v2) v2 FROM test_having_alias_tb GROUP BY id,v having(v2>1);`\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR 1105 (HY000): errCode = 2, detailMessage = HAVING clause not produced by aggregation output (missing from GROUP BY clause?): (`v2` > 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. case2: here `v2` inside having clause use alias name `v2` =`sum(test_having_alias_tb.v2)`, another condition make logic of v2 differently.\r\n\r\n- `SELECT id, v1-2 as v, sum(v2) v2 FROM test_having_alias_tb GROUP BY id,v having(v>0 AND v2>1) ORDER BY id,v;`\r\n\r\n```\r\n+------+------+------+\r\n| id   | v    | v2   |\r\n+------+------+------+\r\n|    2 |    1 |    3 |\r\n+------+------+------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo here we try to make the having clause rules simple:\r\nRule1: if alias name inside having clause is the same as column name, we use column name not alias name;\r\nRule2: if alias name inside having clause do not have same name as column name, we use alias name;\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n4. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n6. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n7. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-09T13:30:52Z","updated_at":"2023-01-10T14:58:02Z","closed_at":"2023-01-10T07:57:29Z","merged_at":"2023-01-10T07:57:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"47097a3db82e27deecf2b2e8bdf809d88c89e627","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1705187220,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzA1MTg3MjIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/planner","name":"area/planner","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Proposed changes\r\nin previous [PR 12872](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/12872), we convert multi equals on same slot into `in predicate`. for example, `a =1 or a = 2` => `a in (1, 2)`\r\n\r\nThis pr makes 4 changes about convert or to in:\r\n1. fix a bug: `Not IN`  is merged with equal. `a =1 or a not in (2, 3)` => `a in (1, 2, 3)`\r\n2. extends this rule on more cases\r\n- merge for more than one slot: 'a =1 or a = 2 or b = 3 or b = 4' => `a in (1, 2) or b in (3, 4)`\r\n- merge skip not-equal and not-in: 'a =1 or a = 2 or b !=3 or c not in (1, 2)' => 'a in (1, 2) or b!=3 or c not in (1,2)`\r\n3. rewrite recursively. \r\n4. OrToIn is implemented in ExtractCommonFactorsRule. This rule will generate new exprs. OrToIn should apply on such generated exprs. for example `(a=1 and b=2) or (a=3 and b=4)` => `(a=1 or a=3) and (b=2 or b=4) and [(a=1 and b=2) or (a=3 and b=4)]` => `a in (1,3) and b in (2 ,4) and [(a=1 and b=2) or (a=3 and b=4)]` \r\n\r\nIn addition, this pr add toString() for some Expr.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n6. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n7.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #15678\r\n\r\nrelated pr: #15558\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nThe double column predicate is pushed down to the storage layer to cause a core dump, because there is no PredicateCreator corresponding to the double type. It looks like none of the double column predicates were pushed to the storage layer before, and I'm not quite sure why.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n### Bug fix\r\n\r\n1. fix image loading failture when create catalog with resource\r\n\r\nWhen creating jdbc catalog with resource, the metadata image will failed to be loaded.\r\nBecause when loading jdbc catalog image, it will try to get resource from ResourceMgr,\r\nbut ResourceMgr has not been loaded, so NPE will be thrown.\r\n\r\nThis PR fix this bug, and refactor some logic about catalog and resource.\r\n\r\nWhen loading jdbc catalog image, it will not get resource from ResourceMgr.\r\nAnd now user can create catalog with resource and properties, like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate catalog jdbc_catalog with resource jdbc_resource\r\nproperites(\"user\" = \"user1\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe properties in \"properties\" clause will overwrite the properties in \"jdbc_resource\".\r\n\r\n2. force adding `tinyInt1isBit=false` to jdbc url\r\n\r\nThe default value of `tinyInt1isBit` is true, and it will cause `tinyint` in mysql to be `bit` type.\r\nforce adding `tinyInt1isBit=false` to jdbc url so that the `tinyint` in mysql will be `tinyint` in Doris.\r\n\r\n3. Avoid calculate checksum of jdbc driver jar multiple times\r\n\r\n### Refactor\r\n\r\n1. Refactor the notification logic when updating properties in resource.\r\n\r\nWhen updating properties in resource, it will notify the corresponding catalog to update its own properties.\r\nThis PR change this logic. After updating properties in resource, it will only uninitialize the catalog's internal\r\nobjects such \"jdbc client\" or \"hms client\". And this objects will be re-initialized lazily.\r\n\r\nAnd all properties will be got from Resource at runtime, so that it will always get the latest properties \r\n\r\n### Regression test cases\r\n\r\nBecause we add  `tinyInt1isBit=false` to jdbc url, some of cases need to be changed.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n5. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n6. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n7. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n8. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-07T02:34:10Z","updated_at":"2023-01-10T16:06:12Z","closed_at":"2023-01-09T01:56:27Z","merged_at":"2023-01-09T01:56:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"211cc66d021cd107644b8be5b552b4e02e9953cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1693771265,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkzNzcxMjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/docs","name":"kind/docs","color":"c7def8","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n1. generate lots of aggregate functions\r\n2. support `group_concat(columns order by order_columns)`  grammer\r\n3. support and generate array aggregate/scalar functions, like `array_union`. we should support array grammar in the future, e.g. `select [1, 2, 3]`\r\n4. add `checkLegalityBeforeTypeCoercion` and `checkLegalityAfterRewrite` function to check the legality of expression before type coercion and after rewrite, copy the semantic check of `FunctionCallExpr` to the checkLegality; remove the `ForbiddenMetricTypeArguments`; move the check of aes/sm4 crypto function from translator to checkLegalityBeforeTypeCoercion\r\n5. refactor the `NullableAggregateFunction`: distinct is the first parameter, alwaysNullable is the second parameter; Fix some wrong initialize order: some function invoke super(distinct, alwaysNullable) but some function invoke super(alwaysNullable, distinct)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nA deleted file may belong to multiple data files. Each data file will read a full amount of deleted files, so a deleted file may be read repeatedly. The deleted files can be cached, and multiple data files can reuse the first read content.\r\n\r\nThe performance is improved by 60% in the case of single thread, and by 30% in the case of multithreading.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nThough this syntax doesn't get suppoted in many other systems since the order by clause here almost redandunt and useless but we have to keep consistent with the legacy doris syntax\r\n\r\nHere is a example:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM (select k1, k3 from setOperationTableNotNullable order by k3 union all \r\n            select k1, k5 from setOperationTable) t;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nHOW to reproduce?\r\nAdd `export CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG` in custom_env.sh. Then build thirdparty in MAC.\r\n\r\nThere will be too problem:\r\n1. build vectorscan with DEBUG type, will got `unused-but-set-variable` error:\r\ndoris/thirdparty/src/vectorscan-vectorscan-5.4.7/src/nfa/mcclellancompile.cpp:1485:13: error: variable 'total_daddy' set but not used [-Werror,-Wunused-but-set-variable]\r\n        u16 total_daddy = 0;\r\n2. gflags will output libgflags_debug.a instead of libgflags.a while build with DEBUG type. Then we will got error can not find library gflags error.\r\n\r\nTo avoid these errors, we set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE while build `vectorscan` and `gflags`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n5. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n6. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nWhen creating an external catalog, Doris will automatically sync the schema of table from external catalog.\r\nBut some of column type are not supported by Doris now, such as struct, map, etc.\r\n\r\nIn previous, when meeting these unsupported column, Doris will throw an exception, and the corresponding\r\ntable can not be synced. But user may just want to query other supported columns.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I add a new column type: UNSUPPORTED. And now it is just used for external table schema sync.\r\nWhen meeting unsupported column, it will be synced as column with UNSUPPORTED type.\r\n\r\nWhen query this table, there are serval situation:\r\n\r\n1. `select * from table`: throw error `Unsupported type 'UNSUPPORTED_TYPE' xxx`\r\n2. `select k1 from table`: k1 is with supported type. query OK.\r\n3. `select * except(k2)`: k2 is with unsupported type. query OK\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n4. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n6. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n7. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-05T13:42:25Z","updated_at":"2023-01-10T16:05:45Z","closed_at":"2023-01-08T02:07:10Z","merged_at":"2023-01-08T02:07:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"500c7fb702cd9a13e4079d8c8c59e78294c4006d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1693771265,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkzNzcxMjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/docs","name":"kind/docs","color":"c7def8","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

keys's order is same, BE will do linked schema change. The base tablet's segments will link to the new rollup tablet. But the unique id from the base tablet is starting from 0 and as the rollup tablet also. In this case, the unique id 4 in the base table is column 'city', but in the rollup tablet is 'cost'. It will decode the varcode page to bigint page so that be coredump. It needs to be rejected.\r\n\r\nI think that if a rollup add by link schema change, it means this rollup is redundant. It brings no additional revenue and wastes storage space. So It needs to be rejected.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n This PR optimize topn query like `SELECT * FROM tableX ORDER BY columnA ASC/DESC LIMIT N`.\r\n    \r\nTopN is is compose of SortNode and ScanNode, when user table is wide like 100+ columns the order by clause is just a few columns.But ScanNode need to scan all data from storage engine even if the limit is very small.This may lead to lots of read amplification.So In this PR I devide TopN query into two phase:\r\n1. The first phase we just need to read `columnA`'s data from storage engine along with an extra RowId column called `__DORIS_ROWID_COL__`.The other columns are pruned from ScanNode.\r\n2. The second phase I put it in the ExchangeNode beacuase it's the central node for topn nodes in the cluster.The ExchangeNode will spawn a RPC to other nodes using the RowIds(sorted and limited from SortNode) read from the first phase and read row by row from storage engine.\r\n    \r\nAfter the second phase read, Block will contain all the data needed for the query\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #15637 \r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nAccording to the post [https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/676684](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/676684), the executable whose size is bigger than **2G** may fail to start. The size of the executable `doris_be_test` generated by `run-be-ut.sh` is **2.1G (> 2G)** now and we can't run it on macOS **(arm64)**.\r\n\r\nWe can separate the debug info from the executable `doris_be_test` to reduce the size. After that, we can run `doris_be_test` successfully.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-05T06:23:44Z","updated_at":"2023-01-08T02:44:57Z","closed_at":"2023-01-05T17:23:37Z","merged_at":"2023-01-05T17:23:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"95f2f43c02197a724b6a421322df4505c02df45e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n1. `Tablet::version_for_delete_predicate` should travel all rowset metas in tablet meta  which complex is O(N), however we can directly judge whether this rowset is a delete rowset by `RowsetMeta::has_delete_predicate` which complex is O(1).\r\n2. As we won't call `Tablet::version_for_delete_predicate` when pick input rowsets for compaction, we can reduce the critical area of `Tablet::_meta_lock`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n3. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n5. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n6. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #15456\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this pr is to import `fileCache` for lakehouse reading remote files.\r\nUse the local disk as the cache for reading remote file, so the next time this file is read, the data can be obtained directly from the local disk.\r\nIn addition, this pr includes a few other minor changes\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nImport File Cache:\r\n1. The imported `fileCache` is called `block_file_cache`, which uses lru replacement policy.\r\n2. Implement a new FileRereader——`CachedRemoteFilereader`, so that the logic of `file cache` is hidden under `CachedRemoteFilereader`.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n1. Add a new interface `fs()` for `FileReader`.\r\n2. `IOContext` adds some statistical information to count the situation of `FileCache`\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n4. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n6. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n7. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-04T12:00:09Z","updated_at":"2023-01-10T04:23:57Z","closed_at":"2023-01-10T04:23:57Z","merged_at":"2023-01-10T04:23:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"f17d69e450bf1281356edd374e8e45023bca01fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates
