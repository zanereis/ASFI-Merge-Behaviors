Discussion in https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/17889\r\n\r\nA few changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n - Update `Variable.set()` method to take a `description` argument. \r\n - Update `Variable.setdefault()` method to take a `description` argument. \r\n - Adding a `Variable.update()` method which will throw a `KeyError` if the Variable doesn't exist, and an `AttributeError` if it doesn't exist in the Database (since a non-metastore Variable can't be modified)\r\n - Improved logging around key collisions between different variable backends.\r\n - Updated documentation to warn users about key collisions between variable backends.\r\n\r\nIf a user has a duplicated key in the metastore and an extra secrets backend, then updates to the Variable will update the value in the metastore, but reads will read the value in the additional backend. \r\n\r\nThis is still the case, but I've improved the logging when this happens and updated the documentation to warn users about this behaviour.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)**

If role_arn is not present, the previous method using boto3.Session is maintained.\r\n\r\nTests have been added for both operators, based upon the existing tests.\r\n\r\nNote that when using IAM roles, S3Hook is not instantiated as there is no need for the boto3 session object.  This means that the IAM principle executing the operator does need to be able to assume the IAM role in the connection as that is not required by Redshift.\r\n\r\nSee https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/copy-parameters-authorization.html#copy-credentials for more details.\r\n\r\ncloses: #9971\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-10T19:43:15Z","updated_at":"2021-10-11T09:48:30Z","closed_at":"2021-09-18T17:41:24Z","merged_at":"2021-09-18T17:41:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"27088c4533199a19e6f810abc4e565bc8e107cf0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

are a set of circumstances where TaskInstances can get \"stuck\" in the QUEUED state when they are running under KubernetesExecutor, where they claim to have a pod scheduled (and so are queued) but do not actually have one, and so sit there forever.\r\n\r\nIt appears this happens occasionally with reschedule sensors and now more often with deferrable tasks, when the task instance defers/reschedules and then resumes before the old pod has vanished. It would also, I believe, happen when the Executor hard-exits with items still in its internal queues.\r\n\r\nThere was a pre-existing method in there to clean up stuck queued tasks, but it only ran once, on executor start. I have modified it to be safe to run periodically (by teaching it not to touch things that the executor looked at recently), and then made it run every so often (30 seconds by default).\r\n\r\nThis is not a perfect fix - the only real fix would be to have far more detailed state tracking as part of TaskInstance or another table, and re-architect the KubernetesExecutor. However, this should reduce the number of times this happens very signficantly, so it should do for now.","created_at":"2021-09-10T17:43:27Z","updated_at":"2021-09-20T21:42:50Z","closed_at":"2021-09-20T21:20:57Z","merged_at":"2021-09-20T21:20:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"bada372ce3c06e30dd47813c21aba2b979cf111b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dimberman","id":2644098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[

we did `TaskInstance`’s migration from `execution_date` to `run_id`, we forgot to check the quarentined tests. This fixes them.\r\n\r\nNote that this does _not_ make the quarentined tests to pass (although some do pass now), only modify them to fit the test setup required by AIP-39, namely 1. `TaskInstance.execution_date` is now fetched via a `JOIN` to `DagRun`, and an associating `DagRun` is now requried for every `TaskInstance`.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes some of the tests to match reality,

a `TaskDeferred` takes a `method_name` parameter such as \"execute_complete\" and this method must then exist on the operator.\r\n```python\r\nclass MyOperator(BaseOperator):\r\n    def execute_complete(self, context, event=None):\r\n        \"\"\"Callback for when the trigger fires.\"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in some cases, it makes sense to simply restart the operator – essentially calling its \"execute\" method. There is however an inconvenience or compatibility issue here in that the resume method receives an \"event\" keyword argument with the trigger event payload – and \"execute\" takes no such argument.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate why this is a problem, consider the problem of having to delay the execution of an existing operator component, for example deferring its execution for 10 minutes. We would like to avoid having to extend the implementation of this operator in order to accomplish this.\r\n\r\nIn #17576, support for `pre_execute` was added – a hook that runs before the operator's `execute` method. The change proposal presented here builds upon this functionality to allow an implementation such as:\r\n```python\r\nclass PreExecuteDefer:\r\n    def __init__(self, timedelta):\r\n        self._timedelta = timedelta\r\n\r\n    def __call__(self, context):\r\n        moment = context[\"data_interval_end\"] + self._timedelta\r\n\r\n        # We must verify the trigger condition since upon re-entry, this will be called again.\r\n        if moment < timezone.utcnow():\r\n            return\r\n\r\n        trigger = DateTimeTrigger(moment=moment)\r\n        raise TaskDeferred(trigger=trigger, kwargs={})\r\n```\r\nThis can be used as the `pre_execute` hook to the effect of delaying the execution.","created_at":"2021-09-09T10:12:54Z","updated_at":"2021-10-18T12:35:40Z","closed_at":"2021-10-18T12:35:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8dfd0a05eeaf1f7768ade7b27303a1edf59d851","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

#18069\r\n\r\nWe accidentally DDOS'd our own webserver yesterday :smile: More details in the issue on how exactly this happened, but the gist is that auto-refresh can be a significant strain if there are many active tasks whose statuses must be polled. Auto-refresh is a wonderful feature but we wanted to be able to lengthen the interval to protect against this.\r\n\r\nOn main, the interval is hard-coded to 3 seconds. I'm proposing we add a new webserver config variable that will allow this interval to be customized.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#17693\r\n\r\nAs is described in the linked issue there is a bug in the Kubernetes Job Watcher that occurs when a node with a running worker pod is removed from the cluster. If the worker pod doesn't completed before the node is removed, it is orphaned and force deleted by the garbage collector. This is communicated by the api with a status='Running' but an event with type='DELETED'\r\n\r\nBecause in the if statement the Job Watcher doesn't check the event type, the last information we get from the pod is that is it running. The running scheduler never gets any information about the pod and shows it as stuck in a queued state. This situation is fixed when the scheduler/executor restarts and [this](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/ff64fe84857a58c4f6e47ec3338b576125c4223f/airflow/executors/kubernetes_executor.py#L433) function is run.\r\n\r\nA mitigation for this bug is to set the execution_timeout for the dag so the run will be stopped or restarting the scheduler on an interval.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more

of 6th of September 2021, setuptools released 50.0.2 followed by\r\n50.0.3 release - both of which fail Flask-OpenId installation.\r\n\r\nThis broken Airflow installation. It's been workarounded for released\r\nversion of Airflow by publishing patched version of FlaskOpenID in\r\nAirflow GitHub repository. This change adapts our main and\r\nconstraint generation to include automated generation of\r\nthe special Flask-OpenId dependency.\r\n\r\nWith this change:\r\n\r\n1) Setuptools is pinned to 50.0.3 (to make sure our builds\r\n   work with that version - this can also give us more control\r\n   in the future.\r\n\r\n2) Flask-OpenID is installed explicitly before airflow is installed\r\n   when eager-upgrade is used\r\n\r\nCloses: #18075\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

hangs instead of gracefully shutting down, thus requiring external restart.\r\n\r\nBy ensuring the `.terminate()` function is _always_ called in case of a failure, the parent process can properly shut

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/17552#discussion_r697817943\r\n\r\nThis modifies the `Timetable.next_dagrun_info()` to take the previous run's data interval instead of logical date. `DAG.next_dagrun_info()` is modified to accept `datetime | DataInterval | None` for compatibility, but the datetime form is deprecated. When receiving a datetime, a compatibility method `DAG.infer_automated_data_interval()` is called to reverse-infer the data interval from the logical date, which should work for all DAGs prior to AIP-39 implementation.\r\n\r\nAll code paths that need `DAG.infer_automated_data_interval()` become deprecated:\r\n\r\n* `DAG.following_schedule()`\r\n* `DAG.next_dagrun_info()` with a datetime argument\r\n* `DAG.create_dagrun()` without passing in a data interval\r\n* `DagModel.calculate_dagrun_date_fields()` with a datetime argument\r\n\r\nAll existing usages of the newly deprecated code paths are rewritten to avoid triggering the deprecation warning, the most significant one being `DAG.following_schedule()`. Most of its usages are to calculate the end of the interval, replaced by `data_interval.end` instead (except those already deprecated, which continue to use `DAG.following_schedule()` to avoid any

is necessary for webserver and worker pods to have the same value of the webserver secret key (#17142). However currently after the chart update webserver and worker pods won't necessarily restart if the key was updated and therefore the key could end up different between the workers/webserver. This PR adds checksums for `webserver-secret-key-secret.yaml` so the worker and webserver pods would always restart in case webserver secret key was changed during update.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

of the last three provider releases have had missing `__init__.py` files in the `example_dags` directory making these DAGs not part of an explicit namespace package.  Based on [a previous PR discussion](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/18019#issuecomment-912825048), this PR adds a check to verify that if providers have example DAGs, there must be an `__init__.py` file present in the corresponding `example_dags` directory.  \r\n\r\nThe CI check will fail if an `example_dags` directory exists for any provider without an `__init__.py` file but will ultimately create any missing files with the proper ASF license text.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

quite some time we recommended MySQL collation to be\r\nutf8mb3_general_ci in order to avoid too-large-index size. Turns\r\nout that this collation is .... case-insensitive (that's where\r\nci stands for) this causes problems in case of renaming\r\ntags (!) where only the case differs (Test -> test) as those\r\ntags are considered equal (!). It would also cause problems if\r\nthere were several DAGs with ids differing by case only.\r\n\r\nMoreoever ... there is no \"cs\" (case sensitive) collation for\r\nutf8 for MySQL as this is apparently a hard problem:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/4558707/case-sensitive-collation-in-mysql\r\n\r\nThe solution in this PR is to change collation to utf8mb3_bin -\r\nit messes up with ORDER BY, but this is not a big problem for ID\r\nkind of values.\r\n\r\nFixes: #17897\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

example dags all use a dynamic start date, but this is not good practice. In my experience, many people new to Airflow continue to use dynamic start dates in their real dags and it causes them problems. For example, they get into the habit of using `days_ago(1)` and that works for daily dags but not for anything less frequent than that.\r\n\r\nI assume the example dags use dynamic start date to keep from spawning many dagruns for anyone who chooses to run them. I propose that `catchup=False` be used for that purpose instead.\r\n\r\nThis PR only covers the core airflow example dags, not all the providers.

way how dumb-init propagated the signal by default\r\nmade celery worker not to handle termination well.\r\n\r\nDefault behaviour of dumb-init is to propagate signals to the\r\nprocess group rather than to the single child it uses. This is\r\nprotective behaviour, in case a user runs 'bash -c' command\r\nwithout 'exec' - in this case signals should be sent not only\r\nto the bash but also to the process(es) it creates, otherwise\r\nbash exits without propagating the signal and you need second\r\nsignal to kill all processes.\r\n\r\nHowever some airflow processes (in particular airflow celery worker)\r\nbehave in a responsible way and handles the signals appropriately - \r\nwhen the first signal is received, it will switch to offline\r\nmode and let all workers terminate (until grace period expires\r\nresulting in Warm Shutdown.\r\n\r\nTherefore we can disable the protection of dumb-init and let it\r\npropagate the signal to only the single child it spawns in the\r\nHelm Chart. Documentation of the image was also updated to include\r\nexplanation of signal propagation. For explicitness the\r\nDUMB_INIT_SETSID variable has been set to 1 in the image as well.\r\n\r\nFixes #18066\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

the standard python logging.FileHandler with advise to the\r\nKernel to not cache the file in PageCache when it is written. While\r\nthere is nothing wrong with such cache (it will be cleaned when memory\r\nis needed), it causes ever-growing memory usage when scheduler is\r\nrunning as it keeps on writing new log files and the files are not\r\nrotated later on. This might lead to confusion for our users, who are\r\nmonitoring memory usage of Scheduler - without realising that it is\r\nharmless and expected in this case.\r\n\r\nAdding the advice to Kernel might help with not generating the cache\r\nmemory growth in the first place.\r\n\r\nCloses: #14924\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

of August 2021, the buster-slim python images, no longer\r\ncontain python2 packages. We still support running Python2 via\r\nPythonVirtualenvOperator and our tests started to fail when\r\nwe run the tests in `main` - those tests always pull and build\r\nthe images using latest-available buster-slim images.\r\n\r\nOur system to prevent PR failures in this case has proven to be\r\nuseful - the main tests failed to succeed so the base images\r\nwe have are still using previous buster-slim images which still\r\ncontain Python 2.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds python2 to installed packages - on both CI images\r\nand PROD images. For CI images it is needed to pass tests, for\r\nPROD images, it is needed for backwards-compatibility.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
