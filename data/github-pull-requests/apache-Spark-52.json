Unfortunately, it doesn't match `Count(UnresolvedStar)` any more.\r\nSo it causes:\r\n```\r\nIn [1]: from pyspark.sql import functions as sf\r\n\r\nIn [2]: df1 = spark.createDataFrame([{\"id\": 1, \"val\": \"v\"}])\r\n\r\nIn [3]: df1.select(sf.count(df1[\"*\"]))\r\nOut[3]: DataFrame[count(id, val): bigint]\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich should be\r\n```\r\nIn [3]: df1.select(sf.count(df1[\"*\"]))\r\nOut[3]: DataFrame[count(1): bigint]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn vanilla Spark, it is up to the `count` function to make such conversion `sf.count(df1[\"*\"])` -> `sf.count(sf.lit(1))`, see\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e8dfcd3081abe16b2115bb2944a2b1cb547eca8e/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/functions.scala#L422-L436\r\n\r\nSo it is a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to check Pandas installation properly\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nChecking Pandas installation is not working correctly, but raising improper exception when Pandas is not installed.\r\n\r\nThis issue occurs because the deleted Pandas was not actually deleted completely when related extension is installed (e.g. `pandas-stubs`).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API change, but user-facing error message is now showing proper error message to guide:\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pyspark.pandas\r\nAttributeError: module 'pandas' has no attribute '__version__'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pyspark.pandas\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.base.PySparkImportError: [PACKAGE_NOT_INSTALLED] Pandas >= 1.4.4 must be installed; however, it was not found.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-16T01:43:29Z","updated_at":"2024-01-24T01:33:11Z","closed_at":"2024-01-24T01:33:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54209f719219d7fe50e32b959d571a189e8c230f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44745/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44745/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44745/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/90c677ffaa0ddf9826ce128dc967833062a53ed5","head":{"label":"itholic:pandas_check","ref":"pandas_check","sha":"90c677ffaa0ddf9826ce128dc967833062a53ed5","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445423122,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoyeEg","name":"spark","full_name":"itholic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/itholic/spark","description":"Apache

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFollow-up to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43984: we should not allow partitioning on VariantType. Even though it is is an atomic type, it represents a nested semi-structured value, so not partitioning is consistent with our decision to not allow partitioning on nested types. Also, for now at least, it is not even comparable, so attempting to partition fails with a confusing codegen error about a method named `compare` not being declared.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImproves error message when attempting to partition on Variant, and explicitly forbids a case that we do not intend to support.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen cherry-picking https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43494 back to branch 3.5 https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44690, \r\nI ran into the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR propose to simplify the `BlockManager`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, close or destroy `BlockManager` depend on interrupt thread and the volatile variable `stopped`.\r\nIn fact, we can change the `stopped` to a local variable on stack and let the close operation of `BlockManager` only depend on interrupt thread.\r\nFor further optimization, this PR using `running` instead of `stopped`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nGA tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSometimes we use more than one filesystems for data warehouse, for example one for hot/warm data and another for cold data, with different storages to save total cost. But it seems after spark convert table writing into data source writing, it is not working as expected.\r\n\r\nBefore this patch, when overwrite a partition with custom location:\r\n1. if the partition location is on same filesystem with its table, the partition location remain the same.\r\n2. else, spark will throw an exception `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Wrong FS:`\r\nAfter this patch, the behavior will align with Hive: the overwritten partition will be recreated under table location.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. to align behavior with Hive\r\n2. support existing partitions on a separate filesystem from table location.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nBefore this patch, when overwrite a partition with custom

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix RocksDB state provider race condition during rollback\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe rollback() method in RocksDB is not properly synchronized, thus a race condition can be introduced during rollback when there are tasks trying to commit.\r\n\r\nThe symptom of the race condition is the following exception being thrown:\r\n```\r\n`Caused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: No such file or directory: ...state/0/54/10369.changelog\r\n\tat shaded.databricks.org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem.s3GetFileStatus(S3AFileSystem.java:4069)\r\n\tat shaded.databricks.org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem.innerGetFileStatus(S3AFileSystem.java:3907)\r\n\tat shaded.databricks.org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem.getFileStatus(S3AFileSystem.java:3801)\r\n\tat com.databricks.common.filesystem.LokiS3FS.getFileStatusNoCache(LokiS3FS.scala:91)\r\n\tat

condition can happen for the following sequence of events\r\n1. task A gets cancelled after releasing lock for rocksdb\r\n2. task B starts and loads 10368\r\n3. task A performs rocksdb rollback to -1\r\n4. task B reads data from rocksdb and commits\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-14T05:58:39Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T02:09:41Z","closed_at":"2024-01-15T02:09:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e09caf7a07ec40795cd14d1f039c39a183cc8c3d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd config `spark.broadcast.cleanAfterExecution.enabled`(default false) . Clean up the broadcast data generated when sql execution ends ( only suitable for long running Spark SQL services ). \r\nBefore this PR: broadcast data cleaning can only rely on when GC is triggered, which may lead to a lot of waste of memory usage , and may also cause query instability if a single GC takes too long.\r\nAfter this PR: after the execution of sql is completed, the broadcast data generated during the execution of the sql will be cleared.\r\n\r\nNote: this parameter is only suitable for long running Spark SQL services. If this parameter is turned on and one dataframe is collected twice, the broadcast data will not be found during the second execution (because it has been cleaned).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n Reduce memory load on driver and executor. This can make a long running spark service more stable. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdd config `spark.broadcast.cleanAfterExecution.enabled`.\r\nDefault `false`,  If `true`, the broadcast data generated by the sql will be destroyed when it is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR propose to simplify the `ReloadingX509TrustManager`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, close or destroy `ReloadingX509TrustManager` depend on interrupt thread and the volatile variable `running`.\r\nIn fact, we can change the `running` to a local variable on stack and let the close operation of `ReloadingX509TrustManager` only depend on interrupt thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nGA

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR propose to replace `Timer` with single thread scheduled executor.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe javadoc recommends `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor` instead of `Timer`.\r\n![屏幕快照 2024-01-12 下午12 47 57](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/8486025/4fc5ed61-6bb9-4768-915a-ad919a067d04)\r\n \r\nThis change based on the following two points.\r\n**System time sensitivity**\r\n\r\nTimer scheduling is based on the absolute time of the operating system and is sensitive to the operating system's time. Once the operating system's time changes, Timer scheduling is no longer precise.\r\nThe scheduled Thread Pool Executor scheduling is based on relative time and is not affected by changes in operating system time.\r\n\r\n**Are anomalies captured**\r\n\r\nTimer does not capture exceptions thrown by Timer Tasks, and in addition, Timer is single threaded. Once a scheduling task encounters an exception, the entire thread will terminate and other tasks that need to be scheduled will no longer be executed.\r\nThe scheduled Thread Pool Executor implements scheduling functions based on a thread pool. After a task throws an exception, other tasks can still execute normally.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nGA tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n'No'.\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-13T11:55:53Z","updated_at":"2024-02-06T09:34:34Z","closed_at":"2024-02-06T09:23:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a0ef31673f33664dca74e191fa800c567610f1b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the field `throwable` to `Expression`. If an expression is marked as throwable, we will avoid pushing filters containing these expressions through joins, filters, and aggregations (i.e. operators that filter input).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor predicate pushdown, currently it is possible that we push down a filter that ends up being evaluated on more rows than before it was pushed down (e.g. if we push the filter through a selective join). In this case, it is possible that we now evaluate the filter on a row that will cause a runtime error to be thrown, when prior to pushing this would not have happened.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-13T01:23:14Z","updated_at":"2024-01-18T11:36:35Z","closed_at":"2024-01-18T11:26:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c9c1bc4acb8b3f6c85ce5385e742edb9dfa25591","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44716/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44716/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44716/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f19267aa6389a458dbdae8ba4e02773073cd4fa3","head":{"label":"kelvinjian-db:SPARK-46707-throwable","ref":"SPARK-46707-throwable","sha":"f19267aa6389a458dbdae8ba4e02773073cd4fa3","user":{"login":"kelvinjian-db","id":110431569,"node_id":"U_kgDOBpUNUQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110431569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db","html_url":"https://github.com/kelvinjian-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":561040797,"node_id":"R_kgDOIXDNnQ","name":"spark","full_name":"kelvinjian-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kelvinjian-db","id":110431569,"node_id":"U_kgDOBpUNUQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110431569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db","html_url":"https://github.com/kelvinjian-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelvinjian-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kelvinjian-db/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n* spark connect does not properly support `spark.sql.error.messageFormat` which means spark exception messages don't change based on the format. This pr fixes that\r\n\r\n* naturally a better option is if we could set the format as an argument similar to scala either via a helper or from the `getMessage` method\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n* adds parity with Better SQL Error Messages support. This already exists in spark so we need it in spark connect too\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ntest:\r\n<img width=\"805\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/databricks/runtime/assets/110427462/0f624369-efdb-4cf0-a82f-1412841c7d55\">\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n(1) increase RocksDB L0 compaction trigger, slowdown trigger and stop trigger\r\n(2) Increase background threads for flush and compaction to 2. To limit the chance of a CPU spike, make CPU priority for compaction to be low\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe introduce two RocksDB tunings to reduce the chance that RocksDB compaction can fall behind, delay a checkpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nWe run an end-to-end stream query where RocksDB state store is reasonably loaded. This change reduces latency by about 30%.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-12T20:40:03Z","updated_at":"2024-05-06T00:19:41Z","closed_at":"2024-05-06T00:19:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5939cfbad662deb2ba05df9407770ddaf21cbafc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes a long-standing bug in ShuffleExternalSorter about the \"spilled disk bytes\" metrics. When we close the sorter, we will spill the remaining data in the buffer, with a flag `isLastFile = true`. This flag means the spilling will not increase the \"spilled disk bytes\" metrics. This makes sense if the sorter has never spilled before, then the final spill file will be used as the final shuffle output file, and we should keep the \"spilled disk bytes\" metrics as 0. However, if spilling did happen before, then we simply miscount the final spill file for the \"spilled disk bytes\" metrics today.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue, by setting that flag when closing the sorter only if this is the first spilling.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nEliminate the `HiveUtils.formatTimeVarsForHiveClient`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`HiveUtils.formatTimeVarsForHiveClient` was introduced to handle compatibility with Hive prior 0.14.0, as Spark 4.0 only supports Hive 2.0+, it's now unnecessary.\r\n\r\n> Hive 0.14.0 introduces timeout operations in HiveConf, and changes default values of a bunch\r\n> of time `ConfVar`s by adding time suffixes (`s`, `ms`, and `d` etc.).  This breaks backwards-\r\n> compatibility when users are trying to connecting to a Hive metastore of lower version,\r\n> because these options are expected to be integral values in lower versions of Hive.\r\n>\r\n> Here we enumerate all time `ConfVar`s and convert their values to numeric strings according\r\n> to their output time units.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass GA.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn ResourceProfileManager, function calls should occur after variable declarations\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs the title

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR propose to replace `Timer` with single thread scheduled executor for `ConsoleProgressBar`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe javadoc recommends `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor` instead of `Timer`.\r\n![屏幕快照 2024-01-12 下午12 47 57](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/8486025/4fc5ed61-6bb9-4768-915a-ad919a067d04)\r\n \r\nThis change based on the following two points.\r\n**System time sensitivity**\r\n\r\nTimer scheduling is based on the absolute time of the operating system and is sensitive to the operating system's time. Once the operating system's time changes, Timer scheduling is no longer precise.\r\nThe scheduled Thread Pool Executor scheduling is based on relative time and is not affected by changes in operating system time.\r\n\r\n**Are anomalies captured**\r\n\r\nTimer does not capture exceptions thrown by Timer Tasks, and in addition, Timer is single threaded. Once a scheduling task encounters an exception, the entire thread will terminate and other tasks that need to be scheduled will no longer be executed.\r\nThe scheduled Thread Pool Executor implements scheduling functions based on a thread pool. After a task throws an exception, other tasks can still execute normally.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Add LocalLimitExec to SparkStrategies in Limit + Offset cases\r\n- Add UT\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOriginally, `OffsetAndLimit` and `LimitAndOffset` match cases were matching then dropping a LocalLimit node. Adds this LocalLimitExec node to the physical plan to improve efficiency. Note that this was not a correctness bug since not applying LocalLimit only leads to larger intermediate shuffles / nodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUT\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBasic support of SparkSession based Python UDF profiler.\r\n\r\nTo enable the profiler, use a SQL conf `spark.sql.pyspark.udf.profiler`:\r\n\r\n- `\"perf\"`: enable cProfiler\r\n- `\"memory\"`: enable memory-profiler (TODO: [SPARK-46687](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-46687))\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import *\r\n\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.pyspark.udf.profiler\", \"perf\")  # enable cProfiler\r\n\r\n@udf(\"string\")\r\ndef f(x):\r\n      return str(x)\r\n\r\ndf = spark.range(10).select(f(col(\"id\")))\r\ndf.collect()\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf(\"string\")\r\ndef g(x):\r\n     return x.astype(\"string\")\r\n\r\ndf = spark.range(10).select(g(col(\"id\")))\r\n\r\nspark.conf.unset(\"spark.sql.pyspark.udf.profiler\")  # disable\r\n\r\ndf.collect()  # won't profile\r\n\r\nspark.showPerfProfiles()  # show the result for only the first collect.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe existing UDF profilers are SparkContext based, which can't support Spark Connect.\r\n\r\nWe should introduce SparkSession based profilers and support Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, SparkSession-based UDF profilers will be available.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded the related tests, manually, and existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of apache/spark#44695.\r\n\r\nFix `CoGroup.applyInPandas/Arrow` to pass arguments properly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn Spark Connect, `CoGroup.applyInPandas/Arrow` doesn't take arguments properly, so the arguments of the UDF can be broken:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> import pandas as pd\r\n>>>\r\n>>> df1 = spark.createDataFrame(\r\n...     [(1, 1.0, \"a\"), (2, 2.0, \"b\"), (1, 3.0, \"c\"), (2, 4.0, \"d\")], (\"id\", \"v1\", \"v2\")\r\n... )\r\n>>> df2 = spark.createDataFrame([(1, \"x\"), (2, \"y\"), (1, \"z\")], (\"id\", \"v3\"))\r\n>>>\r\n>>> def summarize(left, right):\r\n...     return pd.DataFrame(\r\n...         {\r\n...             \"left_rows\": [len(left)],\r\n...             \"left_columns\":

df1.groupby(\"id\")\r\n...     .cogroup(df2.groupby(\"id\"))\r\n...     .applyInPandas(\r\n...         summarize,\r\n...         schema=\"left_rows long, left_columns long, right_rows long, right_columns long\",\r\n...     )\r\n... )\r\n>>>\r\n>>> df.show()\r\n+---------+------------+----------+-------------+\r\n|left_rows|left_columns|right_rows|right_columns|\r\n+---------+------------+----------+-------------+\r\n|        2|           1|         2|            1|\r\n|        2|           1|         1|            1|\r\n+---------+------------+----------+-------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result should be:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n+---------+------------+----------+-------------+\r\n|left_rows|left_columns|right_rows|right_columns|\r\n+---------+------------+----------+-------------+\r\n|        2|

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support `readyz` in REST Submission API as a meaning of `state != RecoveryState.STANDBY`.\r\n\r\n`readyz` semantic is defined by K8s documentation.\r\n- https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/health-checks/\r\n\r\n> Machines that check the healthz/livez/readyz of the API server should rely on the HTTP status code.\r\n> A status code 200 indicates the API server is healthy/live/ready, depending on the called endpoint.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPreviously, the users can check the Spark Master pods' readiness like the following.\r\n```\r\nreadinessProbe:\r\n  exec:\r\n    command: [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"! (curl -s http://localhost:6066/v1/submissions/status/none | grep -q STANDBY)\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, we have the following result.\r\n\r\n**200 OK**\r\n```\r\n$ curl -vv http://localhost:6066/v1/submissions/readyz\r\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n{\r\n  \"action\" : \"ReadyzResponse\",\r\n  \"message\" : \"\",\r\n  \"serverSparkVersion\" : \"4.0.0-SNAPSHOT\",\r\n  \"success\" : true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**503 Service Unavailable**\r\n```\r\n$ curl -vv http://localhost:6066/v1/submissions/readyz\r\n...\r\n< HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable\r\n...\r\n{\r\n  \"action\" : \"ErrorResponse\",\r\n  \"message\" : \"Master is not ready.\",\r\n  \"serverSparkVersion\" : \"4.0.0-SNAPSHOT\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is a new API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-11T13:06:34Z","updated_at":"2024-01-11T19:15:07Z","closed_at":"2024-01-11T19:09:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"29d26cb1c0d329e0fca24c4a4fae22177dd4e0d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44692/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44692/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44692/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0a8cd92e70748d939177c2de9c531696ae12923d","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-HEALTHZ","ref":"SPARK-HEALTHZ","sha":"0a8cd92e70748d939177c2de9c531696ae12923d","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis (PR) introduces the utilization of fractions instead of slots, which is similar to the CPU strategy, \r\nfor determining whether a worker offer can provide the necessary resources to tasks.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when an executor reports to the driver with [gpu, [\"1,\", \"2\"]], the driver constructs an executor data map. \r\nThe keys in the map represent the GPU addresses, and their default values are set to 1.0, indicating one whole GPU.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the available resource amounts for the executor are as follows: { \"1\" -> 1.0f, \"2\" -> 1.0f }.\r\n\r\nWhen offering resources to a task that requires 1 CPU and 0.08 GPU, the worker offer examines the available resource amounts. \r\nIt identifies that the capacity of GPU address \"1.0\" is greater than the task's GPU requirement (1.0 >= 0.08). \r\nTherefore, Spark assigns the GPU address \"1\" to this task. After the assignment, the available resource amounts \r\nfor this executor are updated to { \"1\" -> 0.92, \"2\" -> 1.0}, ensuring that the remaining resources can be allocated to other tasks.\r\n\r\nIn scenarios where other tasks, using different task resource profiles, request varying GPU amounts \r\nwhen dynamic allocation is disabled, Spark applies the same comparison approach. It compares the task's GPU requirement with \r\nthe available resource amounts to determine if the resources can be assigned to the task.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe existing resources offering including gpu, fpga is based on \"slots per address\", which is defined by the default resource profile.\r\nand it's a fixed number for all different resource profiles when dynamic allcation is disabled.\r\n\r\nConsider the below test case,\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\n  withTempDir { dir =>\r\n    val scriptPath = createTempScriptWithExpectedOutput(dir, \"gpuDiscoveryScript\",\r\n      \"\"\"{\"name\": \"gpu\",\"addresses\":[\"0\"]}\"\"\")\r\n\r\n    val conf = new SparkConf()\r\n      .setAppName(\"test\")\r\n      .setMaster(\"local-cluster[1, 12, 1024]\")\r\n      .set(\"spark.executor.cores\", \"12\")\r\n      \r\n    conf.set(\"spark.worker.resource.gpu.amount\", \"1\")\r\n    conf.set(\"spark.worker.resource.gpu.discoveryScript\", scriptPath)\r\n    conf.set(\"spark.executor.resource.gpu.amount\", \"1\")\r\n    conf.set(\"spark.task.resource.gpu.amount\", \"0.08\")\r\n    \r\n    sc = new SparkContext(conf)\r\n    val rdd = sc.range(0, 100, 1, 4)\r\n    var rdd1 = rdd.repartition(3)\r\n    val treqs = new TaskResourceRequests().cpus(1).resource(\"gpu\", 1.0)\r\n    val rp = new ResourceProfileBuilder().require(treqs).build\r\n    rdd1 = rdd1.withResources(rp)\r\n    assert(rdd1.collect().size === 100)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring the initial stages, Spark generates a default resource profile based on the configurations. The calculation \r\nfor determining the slots per GPU address is performed as \"spark.executor.resource.gpu.amount / spark.task.resource.gpu.amount\", \r\nresulting in a value of 12 (1/0.08 = 12). This means that Spark can accommodate up to 12 tasks running on each GPU address simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe job is then divided into two stages. The first stage, which consists of 4 tasks, runs concurrently based on \r\nthe default resource profile. However, the second stage, comprising 3 tasks, runs sequentially using a new task \r\nresource profile. This new profile specifies that each task requires 1 CPU and 1.0 full GPU.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the tasks in the second stage are running in parallel, which is the underlying issue.\r\n\r\nThe problem lies in the line `new TaskResourceRequests().cpus(1).resource(\"gpu\", 1.0)`. The value of 1.0 \r\nfor the GPU, or any value below 1.0 (specifically, (0, 0.5] which is rounded up to 1.0, spark throws an exception if the value is in (0.5, 1)), \r\nis merely requesting the number of slots. In this case, it is requesting only 1 slot. Consequently, each task \r\nnecessitates 1 CPU core and 1 GPU slot, resulting in all tasks running simultaneously.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTo ensure all tests got passed\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-01-11T11:05:09Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T13:17:15Z","closed_at":"2024-02-27T04:00:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"382aa4532147755cd4c1b9338256e109547bf085","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406625202,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI1MjAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MESOS","name":"MESOS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44690/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44690/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44690/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/544318445700c5d2a8350106da4488f7586d6a24","head":{"label":"wbo4958:fraction-gpu","ref":"fraction-gpu","sha":"544318445700c5d2a8350106da4488f7586d6a24","user":{"login":"wbo4958","id":1320706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjA3MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1320706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958","html_url":"https://github.com/wbo4958","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":245613513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDU2MTM1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"wbo4958/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wbo4958","id":1320706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjA3MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1320706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958","html_url":"https://github.com/wbo4958","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wbo4958/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix the bug on canonicalizing the plan which contains the physical node of dropDuplicatesWithinWatermark (`StreamingDeduplicateWithinWatermarkExec`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCanonicalization of the plan will replace the expressions (including attributes) to remove out cosmetic, including name, \"and metadata\", which denotes the event time column marker.\r\n\r\nStreamingDeduplicateWithinWatermarkExec assumes that the input attributes of child node contain the event time column, and it is determined at the initialization of the node instance. Once canonicalization is being triggered, child node will lose the notion of event time column from its attributes, and copy of StreamingDeduplicateWithinWatermarkExec will be performed which instantiating a new node of `StreamingDeduplicateWithinWatermarkExec` with new child node, which no longer has an event time column, hence instantiation will fail.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UT added.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark-XML library users will notice some changes with built-in XML. Notably, some of the character data that was earlier dropped by spark-xml will be faithfully parsed by the built-in XML. Support for new data types like DecimalType, TimeStampNTZ, etc. have also been added. Few spark-xml users may still want to continue using the library. \r\n\r\nRather than implicitly switching to the built-in XML, this PR throws an error when an external data source is detected for XML format.\r\n\r\nUsers can continue using the old spark-xml library by specifying the full package name. Alternatively, they can remove spark-xml from the classpath and switch to built-in XML.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSame as above\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit test\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-11T06:12:58Z","updated_at":"2024-01-12T00:24:24Z","closed_at":"2024-01-12T00:24:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"106c24b0b63412e1f72d2725fcb1a43e79052eae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44685/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44685/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44685/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f8a0f2f69b1ca6f1f74acb7d8da67d77cfa57536","head":{"label":"sandip-db:xml-multiple-data-source","ref":"xml-multiple-data-source","sha":"f8a0f2f69b1ca6f1f74acb7d8da67d77cfa57536","user":{"login":"sandip-db","id":131817656,"node_id":"U_kgDOB9tguA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131817656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db","html_url":"https://github.com/sandip-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":635119293,"node_id":"R_kgDOJdsmvQ","name":"spark","full_name":"sandip-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sandip-db","id":131817656,"node_id":"U_kgDOB9tguA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131817656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db","html_url":"https://github.com/sandip-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sandip-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make DataSourceManager isolated and self clone-able without actual lookup by separating separating static and runtime Python Data Sources.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor better maintenance of the code. Now, we triggers Python execution that actually initializes `SparkSession` via `SQLConf`. There are too many side effects.\r\n\r\nAlso, we should separate static and runtime Python Data Sources in any event.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittest was added.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-11T04:55:09Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:46:50Z","closed_at":"2024-01-12T02:24:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e5687cc630d0774326caa143158426089d1bd94b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44681/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44681/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44681/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a5c2e57959edd7bc6dbdfb959233187e5db52bfd","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-46670","ref":"SPARK-46670","sha":"a5c2e57959edd7bc6dbdfb959233187e5db52bfd","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUpgrade to Sphinx 4.5.0, which is the [latest in the 4.x line][1] and includes the [fix for parallel builds on macOS][2].\r\n\r\nEnable [parallel Sphinx workers][3] to build the Python API docs.\r\n\r\nI experimented with a few different values, and `auto` seems to work best. Configuring 4 workers seems to yield the same improvement as `auto`, suggesting parallelization beyond that is ineffective due to some sort of resource contention. But I left it as `auto` since that's more dynamic and should work better across varied environments.\r\n\r\nOn my 16-core Intel workstation, the runtime of `make html` was cut by ~60%.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# `make html` @ master\r\nreal    43m51.167s\r\nuser    41m43.526s\r\nsys     0m39.651s\r\n\r\n# `make html` with parallel workers\r\nreal    17m8.424s\r\nuser    174m42.051s\r\nsys     5m8.824s\r\n```\r\n\r\n[1]: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/changes.html#release-4-5-0-released-mar-28-2022\r\n[2]: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/9793\r\n[3]: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-build.html#cmdoption-sphinx-build-j\r\n\r\nHere on CI, the \"Run documentation build\" step seems also to have improved from the usual of [~50 minutes][5] down to [~31 minutes][6].\r\n\r\n[5]: https://github.com/nchammas/spark/actions/runs/7477968036/job/20370932121#step:30:1\r\n[6]: https://github.com/nchammas/spark/actions/runs/7484084658/job/20370406870#step:30:1\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis saves developer time and CI time.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI manually built and reviewed the docs using:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nSKIP_SCALADOC=1 SKIP_SQLDOC=1 SKIP_RDOC=1 time bundle exec jekyll build\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-11T04:15:20Z","updated_at":"2024-09-17T06:22:05Z","closed_at":"2024-01-11T07:59:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"22c13e8a00dededf7e621e03c92ee5061d8e4db4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44680/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44680/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44680/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9c232ee4d78b57c890b94cdea42805ac0eb4bf18","head":{"label":"nchammas:SPARK-46668-parallel-sphinx","ref":"SPARK-46668-parallel-sphinx","sha":"9c232ee4d78b57c890b94cdea42805ac0eb4bf18","user":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23797421,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc5NzQyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"nchammas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a Python UDTF API to acquire execution memory for future function evaluation in the 'eval' and 'terminate' and 'cleanup' methods.\r\n\r\nFor example, this UDTF accepts an argument representing the requested amount of memory to allocate (of which it will receive some subset), and a second argument containing the minimum memory allowed. It sets a status column to indicate an \"out of memory\" condition if the latter exceeds the memory allocated by Spark:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import AnalyzeResult\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import IntegerType, LongType, StringType, StructType\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass CustomAnalyzeResult(AnalyzeResult):\r\n    minMemoryMb: int = 0\r\n\r\nclass UDTFAcquireExecutionMemory:\r\n    def __init__(self, analyze_result):\r\n        self._analyze_result = analyze_result\r\n\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def analyze(**kwargs):\r\n        requested_memory_mb = kwargs.get(\"requested_memory_mb\")\r\n        min_memory_mb = kwargs.get(\"min_memory_mb\").value\r\n        if requested_memory_mb is not None:\r\n            assert(\r\n                requested_memory_mb.dataType == IntegerType() or\r\n                requested_memory_mb.dataType == LongType())\r\n            requested_memory_mb_value = requested_memory_mb.value\r\n        else:\r\n            requested_memory_mb_value = None\r\n        return CustomAnalyzeResult(\r\n            schema=StructType()\r\n                .add(\"initial_request\", LongType())\r\n                .add(\"acquired_memory\", LongType())\r\n                .add(\"min_memory\", LongType())\r\n                .add(\"status\", StringType()),\r\n            acquireExecutionMemoryMbRequested=requested_memory_mb_value,\r\n            minMemoryMb=min_memory_mb)\r\n\r\n    def eval(self, **kwargs):\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    def terminate(self):\r\n          yield (\r\n              self._analyze_result.acquireExecutionMemoryMbRequested,\r\n              self._analyze_result.acquireExecutionMemoryMbActual,\r\n              self._analyze_result.minMemoryMb,\r\n              \"OK\" if self._analyze_result.acquireExecutionMemoryMbActual >=\r\n                  self._analyze_result.minMemoryMb else \"Insufficient memory\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nInvoking it yields the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM UDTFAcquireExecutionMemory(\r\n    requested_memory_mb_value => 4,\r\n    min_memory_mb => 0)\r\n\r\n> 4\t4\t0\tOK\r\n\r\nSELECT * FROM UDTFAcquireExecutionMemory(\r\n    requested_memory_mb_value => 4,\r\n    min_memory_mb => 10)\r\n\r\n> 4\t4\t10\tInsufficient memory\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPython UDTFs that import large libraries or otherwise use up a lot of memory from storing many input rows in memory need to register this memory usage with Spark executors in order to protect against OOM crashes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-11T01:07:14Z","updated_at":"2024-01-19T16:30:38Z","closed_at":"2024-01-18T22:22:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bb60b9d59f5d80076b854c8e19844ec2892f1280","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"benhurdelhey","id":123952045,"node_id":"U_kgDOB2NbrQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123952045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benhurdelhey","html_url":"https://github.com/benhurdelhey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benhurdelhey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benhurdelhey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benhurdelhey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benhurdelhey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benhurdelhey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benhurdelhey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benhurdelhey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benhurdelhey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benhurdelhey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nickstanishadb","id":119891435,"node_id":"U_kgDOByVl6w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119891435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickstanishadb","html_url":"https://github.com/nickstanishadb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickstanishadb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickstanishadb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickstanishadb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickstanishadb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickstanishadb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickstanishadb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickstanishadb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickstanishadb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickstanishadb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_ur

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Upgrade `rocksjni` dependency to 8.9.1\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDue to the performance regression in [JDK 17 attach/detach calls](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8314859), JDK 17 Structured Streaming workloads that stress RocksDB also experience a performance regression. We plan to mitigate this issue by writing RocksDB logs to `stderr` instead of the JVM Log4J logger, as implemented in [this RocksDB PR](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/12213).\r\n\r\nHowever, as that will likely come out in RocksDB 8.10, we'd like to incrementally upgrade to verify that there aren't issues with bumping all the way from 8.3.2 to 8.9.1. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWIP. Likely:\r\n\r\n- Benchmark tool for KV store\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-10T23:36:05Z","updated_at":"2024-01-10T23:53:02Z","closed_at":"2024-01-10T23:53:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1ba5c5cde4d479d9f4a52cbfb59f99daeea8f872","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44674/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44674/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44674/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8bcb1b557897f84beb097fb1131d8deca2181ada","head":{"label":"neilramaswamy:nr/upgrade-rocksdb-3.8.1","ref":"nr/upgrade-rocksdb-3.8.1","sha":"8bcb1b557897f84beb097fb1131d8deca2181ada","user":{"login":"neilramaswamy","id":33679306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjc5MzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33679306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/neilramaswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":688675173,"node_id":"R_kgDOKQxZZQ","name":"nr-spark","full_name":"neilramaswamy/nr-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"neilramaswamy","id":33679306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjc5MzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33679306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/neilramaswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/neilramaswamy/nr-spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR makes `SparkConnectReattachExecuteHandler` fetch the `ExecuteHolder` via the`SessionHolder` which in turn refreshes it's aliveness. Further, this makes it consistent with `SparkConnectReleaseExecuteHandler`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently in ReattachExecute, we fetch the ExecuteHolder directly without going through the SessionHolder and hence the \"aliveness\" of the SessionHolder is not refreshed.\r\n\r\nThis would result in long-running queries (which do not send `ReleaseExecute` requests in specific) failing because the `SessionHolder` would expire from the cache during an active query execution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, it fixes the bug where long-running may fail when their corresponding `SessionHolder` is expired during active query execution.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen using pandas UDFs with iterators, if users enable the profiling spark conf, a warning indicating non-support should be raised, and profiling should be disabled.\r\n\r\nHowever, currently, after raising the not-supported warning, the memory profiler is still being enabled.\r\n\r\nThe PR proposed to fix that.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA bug fix to eliminate misleading behavior. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe noticeable changes will affect only those using the PySpark shell. This is because, in the PySpark shell, the memory profiler will raise an error, which in turn blocks the execution of the UDF.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nSetup:\r\n```py\r\n$ ./bin/pyspark --conf spark.python.profile=true\r\n\r\n>>> from typing import Iterator\r\n>>> from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs [promised here][1], this change loosens our Ruby dependency specification so that Bundler can update transitive dependencies more easily.\r\n\r\nOther changes included:\r\n- Remove the direct dependency on webrick, because Jekyll [fixed the problem][2] that caused us to add it in the first place.\r\n- Add explanatory comments to parts of the document generation process that are not obvious.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44628#discussion_r1445151689\r\n[2]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/8524\r\n\r\nWe can still build our docs using Ruby 2.7, but we should push devs to install Ruby 3 since Ruby 2 is [EOL][3] and we are unable to upgrade some of our doc dependencies until we're running Ruby 3.\r\n\r\n[3]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2022/04/12/ruby-2-7-6-released/\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMake the document building process more robust to future updates coming from the Ruby ecosystem.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI built and reviewed the docs on both Ruby 2.7.8 and Ruby 3.3.0 using the following command:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nSKIP_SCALADOC=1 SKIP_PYTHONDOC=1 SKIP_RDOC=1 bundle exec jekyll build\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs outlined in JIRA issue [SPARK-46590](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-46590), when a broadcast join follows a union within the same stage, the [collectCoalesceGroups](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/adaptive/CoalesceShufflePartitions.scala#L144) method will indiscriminately traverse all sub-plans, aggregating them into a single group, which is not expected.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn fact, for broadcastjoin, we do not expect broadcast exchange has same partition number.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBe consistent with closing code-gen, update code-gen for full outer sort merge join output row by row.\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nval a = Seq((1, 2), (2, 3)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\")\r\nval b = Seq((2, 5), (3, 4)).toDF(\"a\", \"c\")\r\na.join(b, Seq(\"a\"), \"fullouter\")\r\n```\r\nbefore this pr, generated code: https://gist.github.com/zml1206/aff18fc313a7164d6f65096a97d233eb\r\nafter: https://gist.github.com/zml1206/a27350b8849951e6efac0fb6088e527f\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid oom. When code-gen for full outer sort merge join is enbaled  and the parent of `SortMergeJoin` cannot codegen, full outer sort merge join needs to append the output of the same key to `BufferedRowIterator.currentRows` which type is `LinkedList`. If there are a large number of duplicate keys, it is likely to cause executor oom.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UT and local test.\r\n```\r\nval df1 = spark.range(10000).map(_ => (\"testkey\", \"testvalue1\")).toDF(\"key\", \"value\")\r\nval df2 = spark.range(10000).map(_ => (\"testkey\", \"testvalue2\")).toDF(\"key\", \"value\")\r\ndf1.join(df2, Seq(\"key\"), \"fullouter\").show()\r\n```\r\nLocal mode and driver memory 1G.\r\nBefore this pr will oom.\r\n```\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\r\n\tat java.base/java.util.LinkedList.linkLast(LinkedList.java:146)\r\n\tat java.base/java.util.LinkedList.add(LinkedList.java:342)\r\n\tat

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove a hard-coded compression codec name from `benchmark case name` in `TPCDSQueryBenchmark`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`GenTPCDSData` can generate dataset with the other compression codecs than `snappy`. So, we had better remove the hard-coded `Snappy` because it's misleading.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS='spark.sql.parquet.compression.codec=zstd' \\\r\nbuild/sbt \"sql/Test/runMain

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use `zstd` as the default ORC compression. \r\n\r\nNote that Apache ORC v2.0 also uses `zstd` as the default compression via [ORC-1577](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ORC-1577).\r\n\r\nThe following was the presentation about the usage of ZStandard.\r\n- _The Rise of ZStandard: Apache Spark/Parquet/ORC/Avro_\r\n    -

general, `ZStandard` is better in terms of the file size.\r\n```\r\n$ aws s3 ls s3://dongjoon/orc2/tpcds-sf-10-orc-snappy/ --recursive --summarize --human-readable | tail -n1\r\n   Total Size: 2.8
