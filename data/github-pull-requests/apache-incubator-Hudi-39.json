Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit eacae1e0dc44e29bbe5cfc29475666bb16ee478d and commit 2fc20c186b77017f7f1c6f6abe8559a9e8cfe578. \r\n\r\nRecently we added support for auto generation of record keys in #7640. We made it work with different keygens but it had an underlying assumption that tables will remain immutable, which may not always be true.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA. Revert commit. Need to be fixed properly.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen the metadata table is enabled and used for getting the partition paths under certain directories (listing by partition path prefix in `SparkHoodieTableFileIndex` and getting query partition paths in `BaseHoodieTableFileIndex`), the following logic in `HoodieBackedTableMetadata` is invoked\r\n\r\n```\r\n  public List<String> getPartitionPathsWithPrefixes(List<String> prefixes) throws IOException {\r\n    return getAllPartitionPaths().stream()\r\n        .filter(p -> prefixes.stream().anyMatch(p::startsWith))\r\n        .collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf all the partition paths contain `1`, `10`, and `100`, listing using `1` returns all three, which is incorrect.  The `prefixes` should serve as the exact relative path and the naming itself is misleading.\r\n\r\nThis PR made the following change to correct the issue:\r\n- Renames `getPartitionPathsWithPrefixes` to `getPartitionPathWithPathPrefixes` in `HoodieTableMetadata` and update relevant variable naming and docs\r\n- Fixes the logic in `HoodieBackedTableMetadata#getPartitionPathWithPathPrefixes` to do exact parent directory matching\r\n- Adds new tests in `TestHoodieFileIndex` to guard around the logic.  These tests fail before this PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #7298.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes the bug of getting irrelevant partition paths given a relative path/prefix.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn post commit in WriteClient, main thread awaits for async cleaner if async clean is enabled. This code block is already within a lock. So, if multi-writer locks are enabled, and if main thread has already acquired the lock, async cleaner may not be able to acquire the lock and it will keep timing out. This was the main reason for our CI tests to keep timing out frequently. Especially we also auto enable lock provider configs for deltastreamer in continuous mode w/ async table services, some of these tests are impacted. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo deadlocks due to locks when async cleaner is invoked. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAs part of post-commit operations, the write client will async clean and archive if enabled. This PR moves that out of write transaction. Within the same JVM, we use InProcessLockProvider and if we execute async clean/archival within that then sometimes the async service will fail to acquire lock.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo public API change. Resolves a test failure.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

So, if metadata sync fails it reuses the same timestamp. This change fixes the case where the log blocks are treated as valid if their corresponding rollback is already visited.\r\n\r\nSo, rollback block follow the ordering and do not effect the blocks that arrive later.\r\nEx:\r\nLogBlock1 (Data log block with instant1)\r\nLogBlock2 (Data log block with instant2)\r\nLogBlock3 (Rollback block with instant3 and rolling back instant2)\r\nLogBlock4 (Data log block with instant2)\r\nAfter processing this change returns LogBlock1 and LogBlock4 as valid blocks.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis change provides a bug fix for metadata table rollbacks. No impact to end users.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nRequired documentation is already added within the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAs of now, record key generation and partition path generation are tightly coupled based on the key gen class used. Recently we added [auto generation of record keys](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7640), its not flexible to be used w/ any key gen class as its a separate key gen class in itself. \r\n\r\nThis patch fixes that so that users can enable auto generation of record keys along w/ any key gen class. Users have to enable a config called `hoodie.auto.generate.record.keys` to let hudi auto generate record keys for them. In such cases, users don't need to set any value for `hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field` which otherwise is a mandatory field. When this new config is enabled, the key gen class config (`hoodie.datasource.write.keygenerator.class`) will determine the partition path generation logic as before. \r\n\r\nAdded a new class called AutoRecordKeyGenerator which will be leveraged in all key gen classes for record key related methods. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nEnables users enable auto generation of record keys along w/ any key gen class. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, we always override the parallelism (translating into the # of partitions in Spark for ex) of the incoming datasets no matter whether user requested that or not:\r\n\r\n 1. If user specified shuffle parallelism explicitly, we'd use it to override the original one\r\n 2. If user did NOT specify shuffle parallelism, we'd use default value of 200\r\n\r\nSecond case is problematic: we're blindly overriding parallelism of the data deduced by Spark (determined based on the source of the data) replacing it with _static_ value (having nothing to do w/ the data itself).\r\n\r\nInstead, we should only be overriding the parallelism in cases when corresponding configuration has been explicitly provide by the user.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWe see more than > 10% improvement in writing performance, avoiding overriding parallelism w/ default value of 200\r\n\r\nFor Benchmarking results check out https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7723#issuecomment-1404524518\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nWe should update the documentation to reflect that by default now shuffle parallelism will be falling back to either of\r\n\r\n - Input's parallelism\r\n - `spark.default.parallelism`\r\n\r\nNOTE: That in Spark >= 3.0, AQE is responsible for dynamically adjusting parallelism such that target partition size approaches set target (default is 64Mb)\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-21T02:45:06Z","updated_at":"2023-01-26T06:09:46Z","closed_at":"2023-01-26T03:29:43Z","merged_at":"2023-01-26T03:29:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"3a08bdc3f971b3534e8fb6f34772340cfdf055a9","assignee":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/7723/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/7723/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/7723/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/3e81f1c24a396b6a662cb09249fc74e613b84786","head":{"label":"onehouseinc:ak/par-cfg-clup","ref":"ak/par-cfg-clup","sha":"3e81f1c24a396b6a662cb09249fc74e613b84786","user":{"login":"onehouseinc","id":79297158,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc5Mjk3MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79297158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc","html_url":"https://github.com/onehouseinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":378248722,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzgyNDg3MjI=","name":"hudi","full_name":"onehouseinc/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"onehouseinc","id":79297158,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc5Mjk3MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79297158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc","html_url":"https://github.com/onehouseinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":fal

Change Logs\r\n\r\nRecently we have more flakiness in our CI runs. So, taking a stab at fixing some of the high frequent tests. \r\n\r\nTests that are fixed:\r\nTestHoodieDeltaStreamerWithMultiWriter.* (all tests)\r\nTestHoodieClientOnMergeOnReadStorage ( testReadingMORTableWithoutBaseFile,  testCompactionOnMORTable, \r\ntestLogCompactionOnMORTable,  testLogCompactionOnMORTableWithoutBaseFile)\r\n\r\nReasoning for flakiness:\r\n1. we generate only 10 inserts in our tests and it does not guarantee we have records for all 3 partitions(HoodieTestDataGenerator). \r\n2. in MOR table tests, due to small file handling, we end up expanding existing file group to pack both updates and inserts and hence no log files were generated. but tests expects compaction to happen after 5 commits which fails the test in such cases. \r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n- HoodieTestDataGenerator was choosing random partition among list of partitions while generating insert records. Fixed that to do round robin. Also, bumped up the num of records inserted in some of the flaky tests to 100 from 10. \r\n- Fixed respective MOR tests to disable small file handling. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFor a config defined by `ConfigProperty` with no default value set, e.g., `DynamoDbBasedLockConfig.DYNAMODB_LOCK_PARTITION_KEY`, even if the inference function is set with `.withInferFunction()` in `HoodieConfig`, the inference function is not invoked in `HoodieConfig` to generate the config value.  This PR fixes the issue so that such a config can still get the inferred value without a default value set.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds tests to verify the config inference.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nCorrect the config inference.  This fixes these two existing configs: `hoodie.write.lock.dynamodb.partition_key` (`DynamoDbBasedLockConfig.DYNAMODB_LOCK_PARTITION_KEY`) and `hoodie.write.lock.zookeeper.lock_key` (`HoodieLockConfig.ZK_LOCK_KEY`).  This also makes the proper inference for `hoodie.write.concurrency.early.conflict.detection.strategy` in #6133.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate

Change Logs\r\n\r\nDue to RFC-46 the profile of the data being serialized by Hudi had changed considerably: previously we're mostly passing around Avro payloads, while now we hold our own internal `HoodieRecord` implementations. \r\n\r\nWhen classes are not explicitly registered w/ Kryo, it would have to serialize class fully qualified name (FQN) as id every time an object is serialized, which carries a lot of [unnecessary overhead](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7026/files#diff-81f9b48f7f7e71b46ea8764c7d63e310c871895d03640ae93c81b09f38306acb). \r\n\r\nTo work this around in #7026 added `HoodieSparkKryoRegistrar` registering some of the commonly serialized Hudi classes. However, during rebasing/merging of the RFC-46 feature branch this changes have been partially reverted and this PR takes a stab at reinstating these.\r\n\r\nOn top of that we had to revisit our current approach to bundling and shading Kryo universally for all bundles. Instead\r\n \r\n - For engines providing Kryo (Spark, Flink) we're not bundling it at all\r\n - For other bundles still requiring it we bundle and shade it (same way we do it today)\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis will improve performance of ser/de during shuffles, since no FQNs will need to be serialized.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow: our bundle validation and testing should uncover issues w/ the packaging if any\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nDocumentation update is required now specifying that `--conf \r\nspark.kryo.registrator=org.apache.spark.HoodieSparkKryoRegistrar` property will be mandatory\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-18T23:24:21Z","updated_at":"2023-01-21T17:16:09Z","closed_at":"2023-01-21T17:16:08Z","merged_at":"2023-01-21T17:16:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"a70355f44571036d7f99b3ca3cb240674bd1cf91","assignee":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2719821152,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODIxMTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/spark","name":"spark","color":"D9974C","default":false,"description":"Issues

Change Logs\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7699/ adds support for any record key generation along w/ any key gen class. But it fixes only the generic record based methods in key gen class. In this patch, we are fixing spark row related methods in all key gen classes. \r\n\r\nEssentially, after this patch, any kind of record key generation is feasible w/ any key gen class even for spark row based methods. \r\n\r\nThis is stacked on top of https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7699 \r\nPending: yet to add SparkAutoRecordKeyGenerator. \r\n\r\nSince this is a stacked patch, check this link just to review this PR only (7700): https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7700/commits/5c759d92fd68bbfdd716bdeb4bb18c1e4a4cd415 \r\n\r\nChanges in this patch :\r\n\r\nIntroduced a new internal interface containing two spark row based methods to fetch record keys, named SparkRecordKeyGenerator. \r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface SparkRecordKeyGenerator {\r\n    String getRecordKey(Row row);\r\n    UTF8String getRecordKey(InternalRow row, StructType schema);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdded two concrete impls named SimpleSparkRecordKeyGenerator and ComplexSparkRecordKeyGenerator. \r\nAdded a factory called SparkRecordKeyGeneratorFactory which will generated either of these depending on whether single field is used as record key or multi-fields. \r\n\r\nMoved some of the code from BuiltInKeyGen to outside since its been accessed by multiple classes now. Fixed every keygen class (SimpleKeyGenerator, ComplexKeyGenerator, GlobalDeleteKeyGenerator, NonPartitionedKeyGenerator, TimestmapBasedKeyGenerator) to leverage SparkRecordKeyGenerator to fetch record keys. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nEnables users to choose any record key generation along w/ any partition path generation strategy for all operation. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-18T20:19:16Z","updated_at":"2023-02-08T00:26:04Z","closed_at":"2023-02-08T00:26:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"88ead0873943ea5bce3dc9c2a1bf0f0f76a917b5","assignee":{"login":"alexeykudinkin","id":428277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin","html_url":"https://github.com/alexeykudinkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexeykudinkin","id":428277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin","html_url":"https://github.com/alexeykudinkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719800718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAwNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:critical","name":"priority:critical","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":"production

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAs of now, record key generation and partition path generation are tightly coupled based on the key gen class used. But these could be de-coupled. For eg, we can't have a complex record key generation with non-partitioned dataset since the NonpartitionedKeyGen uses simple key generation logic for record key generation. So, this patch introduces a separate RecordKeyGenerator interface and uses a factory to determine the record key generation strategy. Users don't need to set any additional param. \r\n\r\nAfter this patch, this is how the record key generation strategy is determined. \r\nUsers will have to configure the right value for \"hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field\" or enable \"hoodie.auto.generate.record.keys\".\r\na. If \"hoodie.auto.generate.record.keys\" is enabled, record keys will be auto generated internally and users don't need to set any value for \"hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field\".\r\nb. else, if single field is set for \"hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field\", simple record key generation. \r\nc. else its deduced as multi record key generation(complex). \r\nAbove logic applies to any key gen class we have in hudi. \r\n\r\nFrom a external user standpoint, no additional configs are required for simple/nor complex record keys. For auto generation, user is expected to set \"hoodie.auto.generate.record.keys\". \r\n\r\nFor internal impl, we are adding a new interface called RecordKeyGenerator \r\n```\r\npublic interface RecordKeyGenerator extends Serializable {\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Generate a record Key out of provided generic record.\r\n   */\r\n  String getRecordKey(GenericRecord record);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich is implemented by the BaseKeyGenerator.\r\n\r\nWe are introducing 3 implementations for this interface, namely SimpleAvroRecordKeyGenerator, ComplexAvroRecordKeyGenerator and AutoRecordKeyGenerator. Each of these will be instantiated using a factory and will be used in most key gen classes where generic record based record key methods are invoked. i.e. SimpleAvroKeyGenerator, NonpartitionedAvroKeyGenerator, GlobalAvroDeleteKeyGenerator and ComplexAvroKeyGenerator will have an instance of RecordKeyGenerator and will call into the resp method to fetch record key. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nEnables users to choose any record key generation along w/ any partition path generation strategy. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nTo fix flink WriteMetadataEvents lost when committing instant:  we add a wait and ack mechanism when StreamWriteOperatorCoordinator executes notifyCheckpointComplete.\r\n\r\n1. **Reasons why we need an ack mechanism:**\r\n\r\nIn some extreme cases, when checkpoints in the writting functions are completed and sending back their meta events, \r\nbut due to network latency, the coordinator notifyCheckpointComplete might be invoked before handleEventFromOperator to handle metas.\r\n\r\nThus, we will commit the instant with un-completed meta events by mistake.\r\nA wait and ack mechanism to verify that all last meta events（lastBatch = true）from each task are received, to rescue this commit\r\n\r\n2. **Reasons why we need a specific ack thread but not in the common single thread executor:**\r\n\r\nIt'll be a DEAD lock between notifyCheckpointComplete verification and handleEventFromOperator in the single thread executor\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n1. `write.metadata.event.ack.timeout`:  \r\n\r\ndefault 10_000L, means 10 seconds\r\n\r\nTimeout limit for StreamWriteCoordinator notifyCheckpointComplete to wait in the ack thread until all meta events from tasks are received and handled\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through

Change Logs\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the savepoint action needs to list all the latest base files before or on the target instant time.  When the metadata table is enabled, for each partition, the metadata table is scanned from the Spark executor, which leads to a lot of S3 requests.  This significantly degrades the savepoint performance when the number of table partitions is huge.  Such repeated scanning of the metadata table is unnecessary and can be avoided by scanning the metadata table once.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by adding a new file system view API that batches the file listing of all partitions so that only one metadata table lookup call (`tableMetadata.getAllFilesInPartitions`) is invoked on the driver side for savepoint action:\r\n```\r\n    /**\r\n     * Streams the latest version base files in all partitions with precondition that\r\n     * commitTime(file) before maxCommitTime.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param maxCommitTime The max commit time to consider.\r\n     * @return A {@link Map} of partition path to the latest version base files before or on the\r\n     * commit time\r\n     */\r\n    Map<String, Stream<HoodieBaseFile>> getAllLatestBaseFilesBeforeOrOn(String maxCommitTime);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproves the savepoint performance when the metadata table is enabled.  The performance of savepoint has been evaluated on EMR 6.9.0 (Spark 3.3.1) cluster with 1 master and 2 cores (all `m5.xlarge` type).  The Hudi table for savepoint has 20k partitions, with each partition containing one parquet base file.  The following code is used to capture the time spent for savepoint action:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.hudi.config.HoodieWriteConfig\r\nimport org.apache.hudi.common.config.HoodieMetadataConfig\r\nimport org.apache.hudi.client.common.HoodieSparkEngineContext\r\nimport org.apache.hudi.client.SparkRDDWriteClient\r\n\r\n\r\nval basePath = \"s3a://<bucket>/test_table_20k_partitions/\"\r\nval config = HoodieWriteConfig.\r\n      newBuilder().\r\n      withPath(basePath).\r\n      withRollbackUsingMarkers(false).\r\n      withMetadataConfig(HoodieMetadataConfig.newBuilder().enable(true).build()).\r\n      build()\r\nval context = new HoodieSparkEngineContext(sc)\r\nval hudiClient = new SparkRDDWriteClient(context, config)\r\nspark.time(hudiClient.savepoint(\"20221223174940864\", \"ethan\", \"test\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n| Hudi version | Savepoint time (s) |\r\n| ------------ | ------------ |\r\n| 0.12.1 | 118.6 |\r\n| Latest master | 31.5 |\r\n| This PR | 10.9 |\r\n\r\n0.12.1:\r\n<img width=\"1782\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-24 at 19 27 02\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2497195/214479031-55da9ef5-c061-4985-9447-8776e5059add.png\">\r\nLatest master:\r\n<img width=\"1782\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-24 at 19 10 52\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2497195/214479046-d8e0077f-88d1-4c87-bb95-6339766582c1.png\">\r\nThis PR: the listing happens on the Spark driver.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen a record is deleted in AbstractDebeziumAvroPayload,  we are trying to get using this method\r\n```\r\nsuper.getInsertValue(schema).get() \r\n\r\n```\r\nhowever, this is throwing null pointer exception since recordBytes.length == 0 and it return empty Option. handled this with the code change in AbstractDebeziumAvroPayload. \r\n\r\nWhen there is a schema update and Confluent schema registry is being used, we have to fetch source schema in DebeziumSource class before deserialising the data into data frame , that change is handled. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nDeletes are handled gracefully. \r\nSchema changes with schema registry are also handled gracefully.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNo changes in the configuration, features.\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAs of now, record key generation and partition path generation are tightly coupled based on the key gen class used. But these could be de-coupled. For eg, we can't have a complex record key generation with non-partitioned dataset since the NonpartitionedKeyGen uses simple key generation logic for record key generation. So, this patch introduces a separate RecordKeyGenerator interface and uses a factory to determine the record key generation strategy. Users don't need to set any additional param. \r\n\r\nAfter this patch, this is how the record key generation strategy is determined. \r\nUsers will have to configure the right value for \"hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field\" or enable \"hoodie.auto.generate.record.keys\".\r\na. If \"hoodie.auto.generate.record.keys\" is enabled, record keys will be auto generated internally and users don't need to set any value for \"hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field\".\r\nb. else, if single field is set for \"hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field\", simple record key generation. \r\nc. else its deduced as multi record key generation(complex). \r\nAbove logic applies to any key gen class we have in hudi. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nEnables users to choose any record key generation along w/ any partition path generation strategy. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

table service actions\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/7634\r\n\r\nAdded a validation step to prevent partition(s) from being dropped if there are pending table service actions.\r\n\r\nImplementing such a fail-fast behaviour will prevent any downstream write tasks from failing.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are 4 types of table service actions:\r\n1. clustering\r\n2. compaction\r\n3. log_compaction\r\n4. clean\r\n\r\n#### Why clean is omitted\r\nWe are only considering [clustering, compaction, log_compaction]. Please refer to https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7669#issuecomment-1409656592 on why clean is omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUsers will no longer be able to drop partition(s) if there are pending table service actions [clustering, compaction, log_compaction] on the partition to be dropped.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\nLOW\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nRecently we added support for [auto generation of record keys](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7640/) for hudi tables. But some configs need to tweaked when using such auto generation of record keys.  \r\n\r\n1. Dis-allow de-dup. If de-dup is enabled (combine before insert), we will fail the write. \r\n2. Fail if \"upsert\" is explicitly set as operaiton type. With auto generation of record keys, we can't support upsert. \r\n3. Fail if \"hoodie.merge.allow.duplicate.on.inserts\" is not enabled so that hudi does not unintentionaly de-dup due to small file handling. \r\n4. Fail if someone choose to use MOR table type:- 2 reasons. a: there are no updates and so no point in choosing MOR. b: preCombine is a mandatory field w/ MOR table. but for table w/ auto generated record keys, precombine if not required to be set. \r\n5. Fail if preCombine or recordkey field is set.\r\n\r\nThis patch also fixes auto generation of record keys w/ spark-sql writes. Added tests for the same. (Create table + insert and CTAS) \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nEnables smoother usage of auto record key generation. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium (Added tests)\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nAdds support for KeylessGenerator for insert operations. This ensures user doesn't need to configure record key for inserts in an immutable dataset.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-13T09:40:18Z","updated_at":"2023-01-25T07:53:08Z","closed_at":"2023-01-25T07:53:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cde27aa80b1d3b9bd620b4b4861cac9856936b3a","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2719846715,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODQ2NzE1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/writer-core","name":"writer-core","color":"3F460E","default":false,"description":"Issues

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently a log msg that says \"Creating new file for partition path\" is generated every time the current partition changes, even when no new file is being created (which is confusing).\r\n\r\nAlso if you have data flowing from multiple topics, with even a slight lag between them, you can wind up with current partition bouncing back and forth when the event time is close to the partition boundary. This in turn generates (in our case) upwards of 1M messages, given our data rate is between 5 and 20M records/second.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high

Change Logs\r\n\r\nSimple fix to avoid class-cast issue when running with Flink 1.15. [The issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-5381) is that `ColumnarRowData` moved to a different package between Flink 1.13 and 1.15, so the common hudi-flink code can't use as that a return type from code that lives in the versioned hudi-flink jars. I believe hudi-flink is compiled against Flink 1.13, as it's expecting the old package location for this class.\r\n\r\nI now return the more generic `RowData` type, which obviously loses some of the specificity of `ColumnarRowData`, but hasn't moved location.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation

Change Logs\r\n\r\nMost recently, while trying to use Metadata Table in Bloom Index it was resulting in failures due to exhaustion of S3 connection pool no matter how (reasonably big) we're setting the pool size (we've tested up to 3k connections).\r\n\r\nThis PR focuses on optimizing the Bloom Index lookup sequence in case when it's leveraging Bloom Filter partition in Metadata Table. The premise of this change is based on the following observations:\r\n\r\n - Increasing the size of the batch of the requests to MT allows to amortize the cost of processing it (bigger the batch, lesser the cost). \r\n\r\n - Having too few partitions in the Bloom Index path however, starts to hurt parallelism when we actually probe individual files whether they actually contain target keys or not. Solution to this is to split these 2 in different stages w/ drastically different parallelism levels: constrain parallelism when reading from MT (10s of tasks) and keep at the current level for probing individual files (100s of tasks)\r\n\r\n - Current way of partitioning records (relying on Spark's default partitioner) was entailing that every Spark executor with high likelihood will be opening up (and processing) every file-group of the MT Bloom Filter partition. To alleviate that same hashing algorithm used by MT should be used to partition records into Spark's individual partitions, so that we can limit every task to open no more than 1 file-group in Bloom Filter's partition of MT\r\n\r\nTo achieve that following changes in Bloom Index sequence (leveraging MT) are implemented\r\n\r\n 1. Bloom Filter probing and actual File Probing are split into 2 separate operations (so that parallelism of each of them could be controlled individually)\r\n 2. Requests to MT are replaced to invoke batch APIs\r\n 3. Custom partitioner is introduced `AffineBloomIndexFileGroupPartitioner` repartitioning dataset of filenames with corresponding record keys in a way that is affine w/ MT Bloom Filters' partitioning (allowing us to open no more than a single file-group per Spark's task)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR addresses some of the low-hanging performance optimizations that could considerably improve performance of the Bloom Index lookup sequence like mapping file-comparison pairs to `PairRDD` (where key is file-name, and value is record-key) instead of `RDD` so that we could:\r\n\r\n 1. Do in-partition sorting by filename (to make sure we check all records w/in the file all at once) w/in a single Spark partition instead of global one (reducing shuffling as well)\r\n 2. Avoid re-shuffling (by re-mapping from `RDD` to `PairRDD` later)\r\n \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImpact of this PR is more than **10x** improvement of the record tagging sequence using Bloom Index leveraging Bloom Filters persisted in MT.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nWe need to update documentation to still elaborate that if using MT partition path users still need to increase # of S3 connections to roughly ~30 per executors core, for it to avert hitting Connection Pool exhaustion problem.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-11T06:25:49Z","updated_at":"2023-01-27T23:48:26Z","closed_at":"2023-01-27T23:47:12Z","merged_at":"2023-01-27T23:47:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"e270924c5eb1548d9022fe3e52d5dd64f61fbdc1","assignee":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2719821152,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODIxMTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/spark","name":"spark","color":"D9974C","default":false,"description":"Issues

PR fixes flaky tests in `ITTestHoodieDataSource`.\r\nTests sometimes are failed because they do the check `hashMap1.toString().equals(hashMap2.toString())` while hashmap does not guarantee that the

Impact\r\n\r\nFixed `testParquetComplexTypes` and `testParquetComplexNestedRowTypes` failed with assertion\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: \r\nExpected: is \"[+I[1, [abc1, def1], {abc1=1, def1=3},

medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-11T05:03:28Z","updated_at":"2023-01-12T08:31:50Z","closed_at":"2023-01-12T08:31:50Z","merged_at":"2023-01-12T08:31:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"f18e9284208f1fbd1f0bc0e30b317dae623f6ea4","assignee":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719804076,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODA0MDc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:minor","name":"priority:minor","color":"FEF2C0","default":false,"description":"everything

Change Logs\r\n\r\n`HoodieActiveTimeline`'s `instants` contains ROLLBACK instants, and it has a method `getRollbackTimeline()` to get rollback timeline, which can replace `RollbackTimeline` class. \r\n\r\nTherefore, there is no need to inherit an additional `RollbackTimeline`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, for RFC-36, since its implementation of `HoodieMetaserverBasedTimeline` inherits from `HoodieActiveTimeline`, the existence of `RollbackTimeline` will disturb it.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nRemove class RollbackTimeline\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high

Change Logs\r\n\r\nLogFileComparator does not compare cdc suffix, for example, for the following logs, they will be considered equal:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n.file1_2.log.1_1-1-1\r\n.file1_2.log.1_1-1-1.cdc\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne problem it will bring is: because `new TreeSet<>(HoodieLogFile.getReverseLogFileComparator())` is used when constructing FG, when the two logs are exactly the same except for suffix, only one of them will exist in logFiles.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFix LogFileComparator\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none,

Change Logs\r\n\r\n_Describe context and summary for this change. Highlight if any code was copied._\r\n1. `HoodieInstant` add state transition time support\r\n2. Add some methods relating to state transition time in HoodieTimeline\r\n3. Add new configure to allow incremental pulling data by state transition time\r\n4. Spark `HoodieStreamSource` need to use state transition time to incremental pulling data\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nHudi timeline can actually miss some instants if we incremental pulling from upstream hudi table, which is written by several writers.\r\n\r\nFor example, say we have 2 writers writing data to the hudi table, and the last success incremental pulling end timestamp is 001\r\n\r\nw1 is writing 002, w2 is writing 003, if w2 is finished earlier than the w1, then the incremental pulling end timestamp will be updated to 003, and actually w1's commit: 002 will be skipped since it's instant time is earlier than the w2's.\r\n\r\nWe actually needs to use commit end time(state transition time) to filter the commits if using incremental pulling. As w2's state transition time is earlier than the w1's, so w1's data won't be filtered.\r\n\r\nThis relates to the [HUDI-1623](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1623)(https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2701) but not adding end time to the end of each commit, instead use `FileStatus.getModificationTime` to represent the end time.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

PR significantly reduces memory footprint on workload with thousand active partitions between checkpoints. That workload is relevant with wide checkpoint interval. More specifically, active partition here is a special case of active fileId.\r\nWrite client holds map with write handles to create ReplaceHandle between checkpoints. It leads to `OutOfMemoryError` on the workload because write handle is a huge object.\r\nEssentially, it is enough to hold only write path instead of the whole handle.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\n1. Released writer in closed create handle. The same approach is used in append and merge handles\r\n1. Replaced `Map<String, HoodieWriteHandle<?, ?, ?, ?>>` with `Map<String, Path>` to reduce memory footprint. All handles are definitely closed by `try-with-resources` with `closeGracefully()`\r\n1. Removed append handle from handle map because it is not used anyway. It reduces memory footprint and fixes potential NPE issue\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWorkload test with `-Xmx2048m`\r\n```SQL\r\ncreate table source (\r\n    `id` int,\r\n    `data` string\r\n) with (\r\n    'connector' = 'datagen',\r\n    'rows-per-second' = '100',\r\n    'fields.id.kind' = 'sequence',\r\n    'fields.id.start' = '0',\r\n    'fields.id.end' = '3000'\r\n);\r\ncreate table sink (\r\n    `id` int primary key,\r\n    `data` string,\r\n    `part` string\r\n) partitioned by (`part`) with (\r\n    'connector' = 'hudi',\r\n    'path' = '/tmp/sink',\r\n    'write.batch.size' = '0.001',  -- 1024 bytes\r\n    'write.task.max.size' = '101.001',  -- 101.001MB\r\n    'write.merge.max_memory' = '1'  -- 1024 bytes\r\n);\r\n\r\ninsert into sink select `id`, `data`, concat('part', cast(`id` as string)) as `part` from source;\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nJob failure with `OutOfMemoryError` on partition 550.
