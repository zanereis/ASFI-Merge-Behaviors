sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4885\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe have no \"virtualenv\" dependency defined, but it is needed by PythonVirtualenvOperator - it nieeds virtualenv even if migrated to Python 3.x because it needs to run other python versions (even 2.7) - so venv does not help.\r\n\r\nIt was not detected before because current CI installs virtualenv. The new CI - as implemented in AIRFLOW-3718 does not install virtualenv and it was detected then.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nIt's already tested but in the new CI test fails without having virtualenv in setup.py\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-02T20:30:26Z","updated_at":"2019-07-03T03:12:53Z","closed_at":"2019-07-03T03:12:52Z","merged_at":"2019-07-03T03:12:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"7448d3c0cd85770021c230bbea33f758718e300b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5518/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5518/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5518/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/2a4ac92e8fcfe4ff380255d362f7e46e30fc5a87","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:fix-missing-virtualenv","ref":"fix-missing-virtualenv","sha":"2a4ac92e8fcfe4ff380255d362f7e46e30fc5a87","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow","description":"Apache

For Airflow instances that are shared across multiple teams, this can be annoying when another team's import_errors crowd the top of the screen and cannot be suppressed by users of other teams. I would like to roll up the errors into a collective dropdown so that the information is available and loud without being intrusive.\r\n\r\n![error-ui-screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/07W3qak.png)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo good unit test identified for jinja templating.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

the hook\r\n\r\n**Future work**: `password` is deprecated https://github.com/dropbox/PyHive/blob/master/pyhive/presto.py#L100\r\nCurrently Airflow bypass this by passing `password` to `requests_kwargs`.\r\nWe should stop doing that and align the hook with PyHive.\r\nSince this is a breaking change I'll do that in a separated PR later to include this in Airflow 2.0\r\n\r\n\r\n###

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4881) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4881\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn case a task instance\r\n- has more attempts than retries (it can happen when the state of the task instance is explicitly cleared) and\r\n- task instance is prematurely terminated (without graceful shutdown)\r\nthen zombie collection process of the scheduler can mark the task instance failed instead of up_for_retry.\r\n\r\nThis happens because the `max_retries` field is not persisted but set to its initial value (`retries`). \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-02T17:02:56Z","updated_at":"2019-07-09T15:21:39Z","closed_at":"2019-07-09T15:21:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3dad824b766e367d0e6dc35d8bb5c1033cf4d090","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5514/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5514/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5514/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c1faf93d0574c94a0647173c0aaf0ace3523196f","head":{"label":"Skyscanner:airflow-4881","ref":"airflow-4881","sha":"c1faf93d0574c94a0647173c0aaf0ace3523196f","user":{"login":"Skyscanner","id":522811,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjUyMjgxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/522811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner","html_url":"https://github.com/Skyscanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":194881012,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTQ4ODEwMTI=","name":"airflow","full_name":"Skyscanner/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Skyscanner","id":522811,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjUyMjgxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/522811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner","html_url":"https://github.com/Skyscanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skyscanner/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Skyscanner/airflow","description":"Apache

Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4797\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nMoved query to fetch zombies from `DagFileProcessorManager` to `DagBag` class. Changed query to only look for DAGs of the current DAG bag. The query now uses index `ti_dag_state` instead of `ti_state`. Removed no longer required `zombies` parameters from many function signatures.\r\n \r\nThe query is now executed on every call to `DagBag.kill_zombies` which is called when the DAG file is processed which frequency depends on `scheduler_heartbeat_sec` and `processor_poll_interval` (AFAIU). The query is faster than the previous one (see also stats below). It's also negligible IMHO because during DAG file processing many other queries (DAG runs and task instances are created, task instance dependencies are checked) are executed.\r\n\r\nTested on our staging environment (patch applied to Airflow 1.10.3), zombie detection works fine, database load is unchanged. Here some stats from `pg_stat_statements`, the branch run there for 4 hours: The new query (1st line) is faster but is likely called more frequently. The 2nd line shows stats of the old query.\r\n```\r\nselect calls,mean_time,max_time,rows from pg_stat_statements where query like '%task_instance JOIN job%' and query like '%latest_heartbeat%';\r\n  calls   |     mean_time      |  max_time   | rows \r\n----------+--------------------+-------------+------\r\n    55416 | 0.0260821553522449 |    5.509762 |   29\r\n 71969011 |  0.575755060854888 | 1078.895322 | 2377\r\n```\r\n\r\nClosed https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5420 in favour of this.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [AIRFLOW-4855](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/AIRFLOW/issues/AIRFLOW-4855] issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIncase of a failure in the following method- \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/65eef1ca3d848ecf02eb79c41a72d736e40a9108/airflow/models/taskinstance.py#L836\r\n\r\nwhere TI increase the try_number and mark its status to RUNNING, the tasks remain stuck in QUEUED state.\r\n\r\nI observed this in K8s executor where  Kubewatcher gets a failed event and it is processed here- https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/65eef1ca3d848ecf02eb79c41a72d736e40a9108/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py#L1233\r\n\r\nbut since the try_number was not incremented by the task, this condition never meets- https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/65eef1ca3d848ecf02eb79c41a72d736e40a9108/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py#L1243\r\n\r\nand the tasks are not even marked for retry even if they have retries configured. I think the behaviour should be same for other executors.  I also think this is a rare scenario, but I still did encounter it.\r\n\r\nI am proposing this change,where in case of this failure, I will mark the task state as NONE, (instead of exhausting task retries) so that the are picked up again for running.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Jira\r\n\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4862\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThere are some cases in which components need to talk to each other (e.g., webserver fetches log from worker), but the hostname from `airflow.utils.net.get_hostname()` may not always be resolvable.\r\n\r\nThis PR provide the choice to let use use IP address directly as hostname, so there will be no DNS resolving issue.\r\n\r\nFor mode details, like the real issue I encountered in my environments, please refer to description in the JIRA ticket

the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3964\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP-17](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-17%3A+Consolidate+and+de-duplicate+sensor+tasks+in+airflow+Smart+Sensor)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n- Add a new mode called “smart sensor mode”. In smart sensor mode, instead of holding a long running process for each sensor and poking periodically, a sensor will only store poke context at sensor_instance table and then exits with a ‘sensing’ state. \r\n- When the smart sensor mode is enabled, a special set of builtin smart sensor DAGs (named smart_sensor_group_shard_xxx) is created by the system; These DAGs contain SmartSensorOperator task and manage the smart sensor jobs for the airflow cluster. The SmartSensorOperator task can fetch hundreds of ‘sensing’ instances from sensor_instance table and poke on behalf of them in batches. Users don’t need to change their existing DAGs.\r\n- The smart sensor mode currently supports NamedHivePartitionSensor and MetastorePartitionSensor however it can easily be extended to support more sensor classes. \r\n- Smart sensor mode on/off, the list of smart sensor enabled classes, and the number of SmartSensorOperator tasks can be configured in airflow config.\r\n- Sensor logs in smart sensors are populated to each task instance log UI.\r\n\r\nArchitecture:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2688818/82953095-09012180-9f5f-11ea-9ded-f472d160af43.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR include following changes:\r\n\r\n1. DB schema:\r\n  a. DB schema change: Add sensor_instance table for persisting sensor poke_context (argument/information needed by poke function) and execution_context (user configured execution context such as timeout, email).\r\n  b. Add SensorInstance class. This class implement function of persisting context mentioned above to airflow metaDB.\r\n\r\n2. New operator SmartSensorOperator. This is the key component for executing sensors when an airflow cluster is running in \"smart_sensor\" mode. This operator take over all poking jobs using sensor_instance table record. It will get context for multiple sensors from DB instead of parsing DAG file, poke, change ti state when task finished either by poking succeeded or timeout or exception, send alert when needed. \r\n\r\n3. Changes in operators:\r\n  a. BaseOperator: Add is_smart_sensor_compatible() with default value as False. It return True if current task is eligible for using smart sensor.\r\n  b. BaseSensorOperator\r\n      i. Add register_in_sensor_service(), it will get sensor context value and call sensor_instance register function.\r\n      ii. Add tuple execution_context_fields to identify general execution context required for handling sensor tasks.\r\n      iii. Add function to get the poke_context and execution_context for sensor jobs\r\n  c. For specific sensor class that need to support smart sensor: (in this PR NamedHivePartitionSensor and MetastorePartitionSensor)\r\n      i. Add poke_context_fields that specifying class attributes that need to be used for poking\r\n      ii. Overwrite is_smart_sensor_compatible()\r\n      (ps: Instruction above can be used to add support to new sensor operator)\r\n\r\n4. Add new state to airflow task_instance: Add ‘sensing’ state. Update UI for the new state as well. 'sensing' state implies that \r\n  a. The sensor poke/execution context has been persisted into DB.\r\n  b. This sensor is no longer holding single process, the slot would be released for tasks in 'sensing' state\r\n  c. Smart sensor will handle all 'sensing' tasks \r\n\r\n5. Change taskinstance.py to add smart sensor workflow:\r\n  a. Add checking after pre_execute for smart sensor compatibility. \r\n  b. Register qualified sensor jobs(which will set the task instance state to ‘sensing’ state) and exit running tasks without poking it. \r\n  c. In order to support email_alert in smart sensor, change email_alert to make it callable from both traditional task instance and smart sensor operator\r\n\r\n6. Manage smart sensor as a service in an airflow cluster:\r\n  a. Turn smart sensor mode on/off by configuring use_smart_sensor configuration\r\n  b. Use native DAGs with a smart sensor operator to spin up and rotate the smart sensor jobs for the airflow cluster. These DAGs were generated from airflow source code and do not need any additional work from user. smart_sensor_group_xxx DAGs will be included when \"use_smart_sensor\" configuration is True and they are handling all sensors in the airflow cluster. Users doesn't need to change any DAG definition. The smart sensor is more close to a transparent service provided by airflow core. \r\n  c. Configure supported sensor class by comma separated class name in \"sensors_enabled\" configuration. \r\n  d. Based on the number of sensor jobs in the airflow cluster, user can configure how many smart sensors should be enabled by setting \"shards\" for better handling current traffic. For our experience, each smart sensor task can easily handle 100~300 concurrently running sensor jobs. This number could be different in different clusters/use cases.\r\n\r\n7. Simulate task instance logs that executed by smart sensor: Even if the sensor tasks were running in smart sensor process, we hold the user can easily achieve the task progress by viewing same log location.\r\n  a. In smart sensor operator, simulate logs for all sensors handled by current task.\r\n  b. For es handler: since logs may come from different hosts and will be messed up ordering by offset, change the returned logs from one big string into hosted logs \r\n \r\nImpact after deploying smart sensor:\r\n\r\nSystem Improvement: The number of parallel sensor tasks is reduced by 85%, and the number of concurrent airflow tasks (both sensor and non-sensor tasks) is reduced more than 60% . The reduction of tasks greatly helps stabilize airflow cluster by reducing the airflow metaDB load, mostly from heartbeat operations (before deployment sensor tasks took more than 70% ratio of all running tasks). \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1812\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-01-10 at 3 26 17 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2688818/82954432-95acdf00-9f61-11ea-90c4-1a692f6d150d.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1812\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-01-10 at 3 28 23 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2688818/82954584-ea505a00-9f61-11ea-8d6a-68afb509c685.png\">\r\n\r\nReducing the request to Hive metastore database because the smart sensor consolidates duplicate sensor tasks.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4509\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nChange `SubDagOperator` to use Airflow scheduler to schedule\r\ntasks in subdags instead of backfill.\r\n\r\nIn the past, `SubDagOperator` relies on backfill scheduler\r\nto schedule tasks in the subdags. Tasks in parent `DAG`\r\nare scheduled via Airflow scheduler while tasks in\r\na subdag are scheduled via backfill, which complicates\r\nthe scheduling logic and adds difficulties to maintain\r\nthe two scheduling code path.\r\n\r\nThis PR simplifies how tasks in subdags are scheduled.\r\n`SubDagOperator` is responsible for creating a DagRun for subdag\r\nand wait until all the tasks in the subdag finish. Airflow\r\nscheduler picks up the DagRun created by SubDagOperator,\r\ncreate and schedule the tasks accordingly.\r\n\r\nAlthough `SubDagOperator` can occupy a pool/concurrency slot,\r\nuser can specify the `mode=reschedule` so that the slot will be\r\nreleased periodically to avoid potential deadlock.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

10% of pylint errors are related to too short variable name (invalid-name error). So this PR proposes to add `cm, db, f, dr, op` to pylint good-names. Those are shortcuts for:\r\n- op  = operator\r\n- dr  = dag run\r\n- f = file\r\n- db = database\r\n- cm = context manager\r\n\r\nStats:\r\n- all pylint errors ~ 4593\r\n(`cat _pylint.txt | grep '.py' | cut -d \":\" -f 1 | wc -l`)\r\n- unique files with errors without new good-names: 676 \r\n(`cat _pylint.txt | grep '.py' | cut -d \":\" -f 1 | uniq -c | wc -l `)\r\n- errors related to `cm, db, f, dr, op` ~ 510\r\n- unique files with errors with new good-names ~ 660\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- 510 less errors to fix\r\n- 16 less files to refactor\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- New variables could be ambiguous if not used in right context\r\n\r\nWe can also try to allow this change only for tests. This could be done for example by dynamically creating `pylintrc_test` in `ci_pylint.sh`.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4509\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nChange `SubDagOperator` to use Airflow scheduler to schedule\r\ntasks in subdags instead of backfill.\r\n\r\nIn the past, `SubDagOperator` relies on backfill scheduler\r\nto schedule tasks in the subdags. Tasks in parent `DAG`\r\nare scheduled via Airflow scheduler while tasks in\r\na subdag are scheduled via backfill, which complicates\r\nthe scheduling logic and adds difficulties to maintain\r\nthe two scheduling code path.\r\n\r\nThis PR simplifies how tasks in subdags are scheduled.\r\n`SubDagOperator` is responsible for creating a DagRun for subdag\r\nand wait until all the tasks in the subdag finish. Airflow\r\nscheduler picks up the DagRun created by SubDagOperator,\r\ncreate and schedule the tasks accordingly.\r\n\r\nAlthough `SubDagOperator` can occupy a pool/concurrency slot,\r\nuser can specify the `mode=reschedule` so that the slot will be\r\nreleased periodically to avoid potential deadlock.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-27T07:08:12Z","updated_at":"2019-06-27T15:54:14Z","closed_at":"2019-06-27T15:54:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"92a3cc4b7b631ebcd46c848ff423aca97e47addf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5493/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5493/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5493/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/a210906e83c1af607c897ba4af899933294d93e1","head":{"label":"milton0825:subdag-using-scheduler-v2","ref":"subdag-using-scheduler-v2","sha":"a210906e83c1af607c897ba4af899933294d93e1","user":{"login":"milton0825","id":6065051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6065051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825","html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":171764273,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE3NjQyNzM=","name":"airflow","full_name":"milton0825/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"milton0825","id":6065051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6065051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825","html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4509\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nChange `SubDagOperator` to use Airflow scheduler to schedule\r\ntasks in subdags instead of backfill.\r\n\r\nIn the past, `SubDagOperator` relies on backfill scheduler\r\nto schedule tasks in the subdags. Tasks in parent `DAG`\r\nare scheduled via Airflow scheduler while tasks in\r\na subdag are scheduled via backfill, which complicates\r\nthe scheduling logic and adds difficulties to maintain\r\nthe two scheduling code path.\r\n\r\nThis PR simplifies how tasks in subdags are scheduled.\r\n`SubDagOperator` is responsible for creating a DagRun for subdag\r\nand wait until all the tasks in the subdag finish. Airflow\r\nscheduler picks up the DagRun created by SubDagOperator,\r\ncreate and schedule the tasks accordingly.\r\n\r\nAlthough `SubDagOperator` can occupy a pool/concurrency slot,\r\nuser can specify the `mode=reschedule` so that the slot will be\r\nreleased periodically to avoid potential deadlock.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-27T04:51:30Z","updated_at":"2019-06-27T07:10:43Z","closed_at":"2019-06-27T07:08:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f636f2c9720233e1435b87966f28ee205a875fde","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5492/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5492/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5492/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/a210906e83c1af607c897ba4af899933294d93e1","head":{"label":"milton0825:subdag-using-scheduler","ref":"subdag-using-scheduler","sha":"a210906e83c1af607c897ba4af899933294d93e1","user":{"login":"milton0825","id":6065051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6065051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825","html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":171764273,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE3NjQyNzM=","name":"airflow","full_name":"milton0825/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"milton0825","id":6065051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6065051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825","html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825/airflow","description":"Apache

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances `SqlSensor` with three additional parameters that allow for fine tuning of usage.\r\n+ **success** and **failure** parameters allow for passing in an iterable of values against which the `first_cell` is checked. In case of `success` the sensor keeps poking until `first_cell` is found in the `success` iterable. In case of `failure` an `AirflowException` is raised if `first_cell` is found in the`failure` iterable. `first_cell` is matched against `failure` iterable first.\r\n+ if **fail_on_empty** parameter is set to `True` an `AirflowException` is raised in case of no rows returned.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n+ `test_sql_sensor_postgres_poke_fail_on_empty`\r\n+ `test_sql_sensor_postgres_poke_success`\r\n+ `test_sql_sensor_postgres_poke_failure`\r\n+ `test_sql_sensor_postgres_poke_failure_success`\r\n+ `test_sql_sensor_postgres_poke_failure_success_same`\r\n+ `test_sql_sensor_postgres_poke_invalid_failure`\r\n+ `test_sql_sensor_postgres_poke_invalid_success`\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4850\r\n \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen specifying a configuration like sql_alchemy_conn_cmd, it should be able to interpolate environment variables from the environment that airflow is running from.  This is really useful when you mount secrets as environment variables and want to use them in this type of configuration option.  For example, this currently does not work:\r\n\r\n`sql_alchemy_conn_cmd = echo ${POSTGRES_HOST}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres.com`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4849) \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] CloudSqlQueryOperator() class has gcp_conn_id,  gcp_cloudsql_conn_id attributes and a object attribute of the CloudSqlDatabaseHook class to manage cloud_sql_proxy but CloudSqlDatabaseHook doesn't passing gcp_conn_id as argument, only use gcp_cloudsql_conn_id. So when the  get_sqlproxy_runner() method in CloudSqlDatabaseHook call CloudSqlProxyRunner() class, CloudSqlProxyRunner try to get gcp credential from gcp_cloudsql_conn_id but it hasn't credential parameter and Airflow send the following message:\r\n \r\n`[2019-06-25 09:31:55,381] {logging_mixin.py:95} INFO - [2019-06-25 09:31:55,381] {gcp_sql_hook.py:508} INFO - The credentials are not supplied by neither key_path nor keyfile_dict of the gcp connection google_cloud_proxy_conn_XXX. Falling back to default activated account`\r\n\r\nThis fix add gcp_coon_id attribute to CloudSqlDatabaseHook class, change parameter passed to CloudSqlProxyRunner from gcp_cloudsql_conn_id to gcp_conn_id and add gcp_conn_id parameter to CloudSqlDatabaseHook when it is called from CloudSqlQueryOperator\r\n\r\nThere was other issue about the problem (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4557?jql=text%20~%20%22AIRFLOW-4557%22) but the solution was not resolve the error because CloudSqlProxyRunner() need a google cloud platform connection not a google cloud sql connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds modification on the following unit tests :\r\n\r\n- test_gcp_sql_hook.test_get_sqlproxy_runner()\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Currently the only way for users to get to know the existence of this option is to check source code of `bin/cli.py` (like what I have done).\r\n\r\nThis situation can be addressed by adding it into

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4845\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIf I set run_as_user in the kubernetes section of airflow.cfg to 0, that does not get applied.  The problem is this code\r\n\r\n```\r\nif self.kube_config.worker_run_as_user:\r\n    security_context['runAsUser'] = self.kube_config.worker_run_as_user\r\n```\r\n\r\nif self.kube_config.worker_run_as_user is an int 0, that get implied as a False and thus the security context never gets set.  This also happens to fsGroup.  A small change needs to be made to make this check against a \"\" (empty string) as that's what it's defaulted to in the default airflow config file.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Adding unit test to test existing dags in database not being affected with the flag.\r\n2. Adding unit test to test new dags following the flag passed. (there are already unit tests testing backward compatibility of the the code change.)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4298\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] This appeared a lot more often with recent versions of SQLAlchemy and is\r\nnot a sign of any problem in the _initial_ case, so don't log the\r\nmessage as a warning the first time we retry.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] No automated tests. Change tested manually\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4835\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nI got started on making [airflow/models Pylint compatible](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4678), and bumped into the render_template function(s) which were real hard to understand at first sight. Because of the large change required to improve it, I decided to split it off in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n- Refactors `BaseOperator.render_template()` and removes `render_template_from_field()`. The functionality could be greatly simplified into a single `render_template()` function.\r\n- Removes six usage.\r\n- Improves performance by removing two `hasattr` calls and avoiding recreating Jinja environments.\r\n- Removes the argument `attr` to `render_template()` which wasn't used.\r\n- Squashes multiple similar tests into two parameterized tests.\r\n- Adheres to 110 line length.\r\n- Adds support for templating sets.\r\n- Adds Pydoc.\r\n- Adds typing.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo unit tests added, but multiple similar tests merged into a single, parameterized, test.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-23T17:24:42Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T09:08:46Z","closed_at":"2019-08-12T09:06:03Z","merged_at":"2019-08-12T09:06:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"47dd4c99a7324cb52121a25001599d4e7597959b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5461/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5461/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5461/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/e0af1d4cfdf7fe43979ba2cf7e7a02e0a853be54","head":{"label":"BasPH:bash-improve-templating-logic","ref":"bash-improve-templating-logic","sha":"e0af1d4cfdf7fe43979ba2cf7e7a02e0a853be54","user":{"login":"BasPH","id":6249654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDk2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6249654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH","html_url":"https://github.com/BasPH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"18d32d969e8e706fbdf16eb6d60406c4dc223c1e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

title. \r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4233\r\n  \r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe issue happens when we have destination url ending with .sql. \r\nIt is related to the defined template extension `template_ext = ('.sql',)`\r\nThe operator looks for jinja template, however, it's an output path, so the file is not found when looking for any jinja template syntax.\r\nThe BigQueryToCloudStorageOperator doesn't have sql parameter as it doesn't work with queries at all. It takes only tables.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

engine to connection because error is thrown from new alembic version.\r\nConnection is expected.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4826\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n - Change the resetdb command to use `settings.engine.connect()` instead of just `settings.engine` because the new version of alembic throws a warning about expecting a connection instead of an engine.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n - existing tests cover\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

editing the state by clicking\r\n on the column.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4809) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen s3_delete_objects_operator is used in a dynamic way (for example list of keys comes from s3_list_operator via XCom) there might be a case when the list of keys is empty. In my case it happens when chained operators are removing old files from S3 and there are no old files yet (because this is very first run of DAG).\r\n\r\nIn case of empty `keys` hook raises an exception (via boto3):\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2019-06-18 13:23:53,790] {{base_task_runner.py:101}} INFO - Job 115: Subtask delete_old_files [2019-06-18 13:23:53,790] {{cli.py:517}} INFO - Running <TaskInstance: xxxxxx.delete_old_files 2019-06-17T00:00:00+00:00 [running]> on host 82f571f444f5\r\n[2019-06-18 13:23:56,199] {{__init__.py:1580}} ERROR - An error occurred (MalformedXML) when calling the DeleteObjects operation: The XML you provided was not well-formed or did not validate against our published schema\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/airflow/models/__init__.py\", line 1441, in _run_raw_task\r\n    result = task_copy.execute(context=context)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/airflow/contrib/operators/s3_delete_objects_operator.py\", line 80, in execute\r\n    response = s3_hook.delete_objects(bucket=self.bucket, keys=self.keys)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/airflow/hooks/S3_hook.py\", line 542, in delete_objects\r\n    Delete=delete_dict)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/botocore/client.py\", line 357, in _api_call\r\n    return self._make_api_call(operation_name, kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/botocore/client.py\", line 661, in _make_api_call\r\n    raise error_class(parsed_response, operation_name)\r\nbotocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred (MalformedXML) when calling the DeleteObjects operation: The XML you provided was not well-formed or did not validate against our published schema\r\n```\r\nThe provided patch modifies the operator behavior - if there is nothing to delete from S3 it just returns.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-18T13:34:13Z","updated_at":"2019-09-26T20:49:18Z","closed_at":"2019-09-26T20:49:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4c594b356bccee11ff7a96399e093a84e06bdfc3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon
