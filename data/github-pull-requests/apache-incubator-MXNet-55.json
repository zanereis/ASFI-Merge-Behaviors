Description ##\r\nOriginally, while_loop and cond always return lists regardless of what their UDFs return. To make the API more intuitive, it's better to use the output format of their UDFs for all control flow operators.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nHot fix for the topk regression issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/12197\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] topk\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nFix the issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/12197, but the original design which converts return indices from type `int` to `float` could cause incorrect result when `element_num` is large enough unless the API changes to use `int` for returning indices.\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel","created_at":"2018-08-16T12:14:17Z","updated_at":"2018-12-10T03:05:00Z","closed_at":"2018-08-16T18:15:30Z","merged_at":"2018-08-16T18:15:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"1d31776f07f4a81e4690ab4afabb264d70066bba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12202/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12202/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12202/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/886e695cd7367acfa05fdf5ca4d5414b68ae6d57","head":{"label":"ciyongch:topk_regression","ref":"topk_regression","sha":"886e695cd7367acfa05fdf5ca4d5414b68ae6d57","user":{"login":"ciyongch","id":17443780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDQzNzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17443780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch","html_url":"https://github.com/ciyongch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":143113480,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDMxMTM0ODA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"ciyongch/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ciyongch","id":17443780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDQzNzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17443780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch","html_url":"https://github.com/ciyongch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ciyongch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ciyongch/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nSome Python 3 incompatibilities existed in the website build pipeline. When CI was updated to run docs build in Python 3 mode these surfaced. This PR addresses it and locks in the Python dependency versions to help prevent future breakage.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n* Fixed Sphinx plugin mxdoc.py Python 3 issues by using `six`.\r\n* Added `six` to dependencies\r\n* Consolidated Python requirements for docs to one file in `ci/docker/install`\r\n* Pinned dependencies to specific version numbers\r\n* `mock` was not pinned upstream from docs, so we were getting a later version than what docs had been pinned to, so this is upgraded.\r\n* \"Upgraded\" a variety of packages that were not pinned to the latest in PyPI. Tests indicate things are good, and I'd rather pin things now to prevent future breakage.\r\n* Added a separate `Jenkinsfile-dev` so I don't have to keep hacking the Jenkinsfile every time I need to test something from my fork. This way I can just point to it from the test Jenkins jobs directly, and no more code updates. \r\n* Updated CI's docker images to use the new Python requirements file\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n* We can break out a separate requirements file if some split in deps appears between Python 2/3. For now the packages are the

Description ##\r\nFix flaky tests present in #12112 .\r\n\r\n(I think it is a very tiny change, so do not have to add a JIRA-ID.)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Increase threshold to 1e-3.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- At the time of writing control flow operators, `CachedOp` could not behave properly when using `+` a lot, especially at the last step (This weird thing is fixed later). So we decided to use `*` instead of `+`, which could potentially harm numeral stability. In this PR, I simply increase the threshold to 1e-3 to be more tolerate more instability.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-15T22:10:18Z","updated_at":"2018-08-20T19:20:42Z","closed_at":"2018-08-20T19:20:41Z","merged_at":"2018-08-20T19:20:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"383a2d0e4791a3899272c4ecf4ff2535f558fb53","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":721783588,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM1ODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Flaky","name":"Flaky","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Define cmp() in Python 3\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis is to fix the issue described in\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/12163\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nAs reported in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/12116, the modification in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11951 causes excessive memory consumption. The reason is that https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11951 actually turns on recording even in the inference mode.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-15T18:22:43Z","updated_at":"2018-09-29T21:32:01Z","closed_at":"2018-08-17T19:20:28Z","merged_at":"2018-08-17T19:20:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"cd9f9c87a65caf2d3ac451066e05fb40f3db5e96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12184/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12184/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12184/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/65a53aafd9312987bbfdba625a2d8212211fc64a","head":{"label":"zheng-da:fix_cachedop2","ref":"fix_cachedop2","sha":"65a53aafd9312987bbfdba625a2d8212211fc64a","user":{"login":"zheng-da","id":70481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da","html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":103710066,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDM3MTAwNjY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"zheng-da/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zheng-da","id":70481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da","html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThe log `self.logger.info('Epoch[%d] Train-%s=%f', epoch, name, val)` gives the user the impression that the metric printed is for the entire epoch, which is misleading. When `auto_reset=False`, Train-\\<metric\\> is the average for the entire epoch and when `auto_reset=True`, Train-\\<metric\\> reflects the metric value for the remaining batches in the epoch.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Track epoch metric value separately\r\n- Print batch numbers for which Speedometer prints metric value\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO:root:Epoch[0] Batch [100]  Speed: 45690.13 samples/sec     accuracy=0.772123\r\nINFO:root:Epoch[0] Batch [200]  Speed: 50611.24 samples/sec

same metric as eval_metric, but separately. Since EvalMetric objects used in fit() are typically small (and the copy is done only once per fit() call), this will not add significant overhead.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTesting done:\r\n- Tested image classification example (train_mnist.py, train_imagenet.py) with these changes\r\n- Tested with Speedometer's auto_reset=True and auto_reset=False \r\n- Tested with default metric 'accuracy', composite metric ['accuracy','rmse'], and EvalMetric object\r\n- Tested tools/parse_log.py\r\n\r\n@indhub

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds argument worker_fn to _MultiWorkerIter. The default value will be worker_loop, so existing examples will not be affected. This allows us to accept outputs with user defined format from sampler, improving the flexibility of the dataloader. This will be used in Gluon NLP https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/pull/280. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\n\r\nThe fix in #11493 allows reshape only for networks that don't use SoftmaxOutput, so none of the pretrained image classification networks, e.g. inception, can be reshaped. The current test did not catch this because it only used gluon blocks. The reason SoftmaxOutput is weird is because it requires the label \"softmax_label\" to be reshaped even though \"softmax_label\" is only used as an input for training and should not even be looked at for prediction, [which has been mentioned in other context before](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44947104/mxnet-label-shapes-dont-match-names-specified-by-label-names). I don't know what's the best way to deal with SoftmaxOutput's label reshape requirement because I can't find a way to get the label names. I am sending this pull request with an edit that allows resnet and inception to be reshaped, along with a test that covers this edge case, but I hope someone can comment on a more robust solution.\r\n\r\nI found this issue when I made the following edits to [image-classification-predict.cc:223](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/image-classification/predict-cpp/image-classification-predict.cc#L223). Before this change, the following would print out -1 and I traced it to `c_predict_api.cc:304` where `newShape.Size() != arr.shape().Size()` for when `arg_names[I]` is `softmax_label`: \r\n```c++\r\n

Description ##\r\nReverts apache/incubator-mxnet#12129\r\n\r\nThis is to circumvent double free memory error in #12139. The memory error has been inside CSVIter but remained undetected until a recent modification of CSVParser.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Revert dmlc-core to last working point\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This is a temporary measure. We'll need to come back to CSVIter and address memory error. Address Sanitizer reveals double free issues in

Description ##\r\nAdded test for the previous PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12155 that set binded flag after setup complete.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add test to check that binded is set correctly.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-14T20:12:38Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T19:44:57Z","closed_at":"2018-08-17T19:44:57Z","merged_at":"2018-08-17T19:44:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"f737cace17991d0505e891110f67a9d945acccb2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":721783490,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM0OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Test","name":"Test","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NzQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-testing","name":"pr-awaiting-testing","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nCurrently the module API can only accept DataIter as an input type. However, for developers who wish to quickly try out the module api (build a sym and then bind to a module), the predict API is one of the quickest ways to check if their network produces valid outputs. The developer may not want to learn to use the DataIter API and it is intuitive for the developer to think they can pass an NDArray or np.array as an input the predict  API. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I added an Exception that will warn developers if they use an incorrect input type (currently they run into a runtime exception if the input type does not have a `.data` method.\r\n\r\nCurrently:\r\n```\r\nIn [1]: import mxnet as mx\r\n   ...: import numpy as np\r\n   ...:\r\n   ...: # from docs https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/module/module.html\r\n   ...: data = mx.sym.Variable('data')\r\n   ...: fc1  = mx.sym.FullyConnected(data, name='fc1', num_hidden=128)\r\n   ...: out  = mx.sym.SoftmaxOutput(fc1, name = 'softmax')\r\n   ...: mod = mx.mod.Module(out)\r\n   ...:\r\n   ...: mod.bind(data_shapes=[('data', [10,10])]) # this errors\r\n   ...: mod.init_params()\r\n   ...:\r\n   ...: data = np.random.rand(10,10)\r\n   ...: mod.predict(data)\r\n   ...:\r\n/Users/alexzai/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/h5py/__init__.py:36: FutureWarning: Conversion of the second argument of issubdtype from `float` to `np.floating` is deprecated.

Description ##\r\nFix for Issue [#11736](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11736)\r\nRemoved fixed seed and increased learning rate and tolerance for test_nadam. \r\nby keeping tolerance rate fixed(10%) and increasing the learning rate(0.0005->0.001) the test failed once after 5500 run but ran successfully the next time for all 10k runs. Increasing the no. of epochs will increase the total time for the test hence avoided increasing the no. of epochs and increased the tolerance by 1%.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nRemoved Fixed seed.

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds mechanisms on the build scripts to cleanup docker containers when there is a cancellation, either from the user by sending SIGINT / SIGTERM or when the process inside the container ends with an error.\r\n\r\nIt also propagates the environment variables from Jenkins which are used by the process tree killer to identify runaway processes so processes inside the container are killed when the Jenkins job is stopped.\r\n\r\nWith this patch we catch SIGINT and SIGTERM and install a handler on atexit which cleans (stops) docker containers which were created during execution of the build.\r\n\r\nWe also switch to python docker API for better management of running containers.\r\n\r\nSince Jenkins is suppossed to send SIGINT / SIGTERM on job cancellation this should also provent zombie containers in CI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-14T12:39:08Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T12:48:26Z","closed_at":"2018-08-15T10:57:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0aebf1f590fce3c9c8c6c0f8f0f7bbbf5afdc522","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12161/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12161/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12161/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/bca15fe7680ba8fe6aa0048f9007af922f3d1992","head":{"label":"larroy:zombies","ref":"zombies","sha":"bca15fe7680ba8fe6aa0048f9007af922f3d1992","user":{"login":"larroy","id":928489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODQ4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/928489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy","html_url":"https://github.com/larroy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77059342,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzA1OTM0Mg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"larroy/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"larroy","id":928489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODQ4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/928489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy","html_url":"https://github.com/larroy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/larroy/mxnet","description":"This

Description ##\r\n\r\nUsing a different OpenMP library from the one supplied by the compiler can lead to undefined behaviour. Multiple problems were reported by users of MXNet.\r\n\r\nIf there is need to use OpenMP library provided by llvm, one should compile MXNet with latest Clang, which is now supported as a test stage by the CI.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] This is a minor change\r\n- [x] Changes are complete\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Removed OpenMP overwrite from CMakeLists.txt\r\n- [x]

Description ##\r\nThis is a joint work of @reminisce and @zheng-da on implementing subgraph API for integrating backend accelerators (TVM, MKLDNN, TensorRT, nGraph, etc.) with MXNet. See [design proposal](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Unified+integration+with+external+backend+libraries).\r\n\r\n## Highlighted deliverables\r\n- A graph partitioning algorithm accepting custom partitioning rules (through subclassing `SubgraphProperty`).\r\n- A naive graph partitioning rule called `DefaultSubgraphProperty` partitioning graphs based upon provided operator names. For example, in the left graph, operators B and C are designated to be grouped into a subgraph operator node. After applying the partitioning algorithm, nodes B and C are replaced by a subgraph operator node in the graph on the right-hand-side.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4978794/44073224-a7ef9318-9f47-11e8-8325-b03af5157e7a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n- `DefaultSubgraphOperator`. A stateful operator storing a subgraph for execution by `CachedOp`.\r\n- `NDArray` version number for tracking mutations of `NDArray`s. This is useful, for example, in a stateful MKLDNN subgraph operator for checking whether input data has changed since the last forward call to decide if to trigger data format conversion.\r\n- Graph partitioning enabled in `GraphExecutor` for the forward pass. Triggered by an environment variable `MXNET_SUBGRAPH_BACKEND`.\r\n\r\n## Coming soon after this PR\r\n- Backward pass support in `DefaultSubgraphOperator`.\r\n- Support graph partitioning for Gluon/CacheOp.\r\n- Tutorial for developers on integrating backend accelerators using the Subgraph API.\r\n- Real backend accelerator integration with MXNet.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2018-08-14T05:54:24Z","updated_at":"2018-09-03T10:58:15Z","closed_at":"2018-08-31T02:13:34Z","merged_at":"2018-08-31T02:13:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"a64cf7d9c8c1c473e201b5bd68ab9af6bf7365ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12157/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12157/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12157/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/ae2b480759a5c50278b3b770872dcd7a96e86124","head":{"label":"reminisce:subgraph_api_to_master","ref":"subgraph_api_to_master","sha":"ae2b480759a5c50278b3b770872dcd7a96e86124","user":{"login":"reminisce","id":4978794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg3OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4978794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce","html_url":"https://github.com/reminisce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79397572,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3OTM5NzU3Mg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"reminisce/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"reminisce","id":4978794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg3OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4978794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce","html_url":"https://github.com/reminisce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/reminisce/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nAdded a randn method to random module. numpy currently has support for a random tensor generator that accepts a shape and outputs with normal distribution (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.randn.html). This behavior can currently be emulated with mx.nd.random.normal(shape=(3,3)), but adding this method to mxnet will make it easier for developers who are familiar with numpy API:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmx.nd.random.rand(3,3)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add `randn` method to random module\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-14T00:08:19Z","updated_at":"2018-08-23T01:14:20Z","closed_at":"2018-08-23T01:14:20Z","merged_at":"2018-08-23T01:14:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"1ffb3f58a35461bac62f9ae637f36ebbfd580883","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12156/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12156/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12156/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/dca7378ab60ddb221b1949f7c0dacc3f18c642a6","head":{"label":"azai91:feature/randn","ref":"feature/randn","sha":"dca7378ab60ddb221b1949f7c0dacc3f18c642a6","user":{"login":"azai91","id":8272546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzI1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8272546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91","html_url":"https://github.com/azai91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109348168,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDkzNDgxNjg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"azai91/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"azai91","id":8272546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzI1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8272546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91","html_url":"https://github.com/azai91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/azai91/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nCurrently the bind flag under the module API is set in the beginning of the function. However, if any of the downstream functions error out then the module will not work properly and the bound flag will still be set. If the user acknowledges the issue and attempts to rebind they are unable to. \r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [19]: mod.bind(data_shapes=[('data_shapes', (10))])\r\nWARNING:root:Already bound, ignoring bind()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe currently have a `force_rebind` flag, however users may not realize that they need to as the above warning message indicates that the mod is already bound.\r\n\r\nA host of problems then occurs if the user attempts to use the incorrectly bound module such as when they init_params:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [20]: mod.init_params()\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-20-b2c7a95a0724> in <module>()\r\n----> 1 mod.init_params()\r\n\r\n~/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mxnet/module/module.py in init_params(self, initializer, arg_params, aux_params, allow_missing, force_init, allow_extra)\r\n    305\r\n    306         attrs = self._symbol.attr_dict()\r\n--> 307         for name, arr in sorted(self._arg_params.items()):\r\n    308             desc = InitDesc(name, attrs.get(name, None))\r\n    309             _impl(desc, arr, arg_params)\r\n\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'items'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI moved the `bind` flag to the end so that they user will get the usual 'call bind before initializing the parameters' if the module is incorrectly bound.\r\n\r\nBelow is simple example that would bind the module incorrectly:\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\n\r\n# from docs https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/module/module.html\r\ndata = mx.sym.Variable('data')\r\nfc1  = mx.sym.FullyConnected(data, name='fc1', num_hidden=128)\r\nact1 = mx.sym.Activation(fc1, name='relu1', act_type=\"relu\")\r\nfc2  = mx.sym.FullyConnected(act1, name='fc2', num_hidden=10)\r\nout  = mx.sym.SoftmaxOutput(fc2, name = 'softmax')\r\nmod = mx.mod.Module(out)\r\n\r\nmod.bind(data_shapes=[('data', mx.nd.array([10,10]))]) # this errors\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] set bind flag to end of bind method\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-13T23:28:03Z","updated_at":"2018-08-14T01:48:29Z","closed_at":"2018-08-14T01:48:29Z","merged_at":"2018-08-14T01:48:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"92edca81ead16913f3ba3816d951d5f5497084f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12155/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12155/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12155/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/a274d4e673f1bafd8e485e33f4ef9d9d9962936f","head":{"label":"azai91:fix/move-bind","ref":"fix/move-bind","sha":"a274d4e673f1bafd8e485e33f4ef9d9d9962936f","user":{"login":"azai91","id":8272546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzI1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8272546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91","html_url":"https://github.com/azai91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109348168,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDkzNDgxNjg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"azai91/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"azai91","id":8272546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzI1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8272546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91","html_url":"https://github.com/azai91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/azai91/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Pin RAT to 0.12 instead of trunk\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n\r\n\r\n@larroy

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\n\r\nAdd `last_batch_handle` parameter to ImageIter based on #11883\r\n* last_batch_handle support `pad`(default), `discard`, `roll_over`\r\n\r\nNote that reading record files(.rec) without shuffle(i.e. sequential read) didn't support 'discard'\r\n \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n * Add last_batch_handle feature to ImageIter and adjust test_imageiter to test last_batch_handle parameter\r\n * Change the shuffle behavior to the same as NDArrayIter where shuffling the data only happen during the iterator initialization\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nN/A\r\n@zhreshold

Description ##\r\ncontrib.box_nms and contrib.bipartite_matchin use floating number array to store indices which can be extremely large. \r\nTo avoid overflow when float32/float16 is casted to integer, this PR force use int32_t in indices arrays. (the new limit is 2^31 - 1 instead of 2^k + 1 where k is the mantissa bits of float type)\r\n\r\n- Test updated for various dtypes\r\n- no functionality change\r\n- no API change\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nThis is the PR for migrating Scala test to nightly build. The action I applied here is to provide a new function in `Util` that can check which test to run and how many epochs needed to run. All Integration test will run 1 epoch in default and nightly will run more for performance and accuracy checking.\r\n\r\n@nswamy @yzhliu @andrewfayres @marcoabreu \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-09T19:02:15Z","updated_at":"2018-09-19T23:00:01Z","closed_at":"2018-08-27T05:04:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4c90e427a124630dccda5d8067cf3175d6041837","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":337768593,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzc3Njg1OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Scala","name":"Scala","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799191,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5MTkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-response","name":"pr-awaiting-response","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in assigning names of subgraphs. The `CutSubgraph` works as expected only when each subgraph has its unique name.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures it by creating a global dict in `AttrScope`, which is pretty ugly though. I am not aware of any other solutions that could ensure a set of strings to be unique globally. If there is better solution, please let me know. Thanks!\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the

changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add `_subgraph_names` into `AttrScope` as static member.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- See also: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12078, which is another bug related to cutting subgraphs.","created_at":"2018-08-09T07:58:13Z","updated_at":"2018-08-22T02:19:21Z","closed_at":"2018-08-22T01:48:34Z","merged_at":"2018-08-22T01:48:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"c692ffde3d7fede821043f9ec50ccdd062fbdc6c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12106/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12106/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12106/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/6c447706e8ff8132739bb1cef4be9150ebe66c91","head":{"label":"junrushao:fix-subgraph-duplicate-scope","ref":"fix-subgraph-duplicate-scope","sha":"6c447706e8ff8132739bb1cef4be9150ebe66c91","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":139630847,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzk2MzA4NDc=","name":"mxnet","full_name":"junrushao/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

precision issue of test case #11410 test_rnnrelu_bidirectional.  Sometimes, the data comparison will fail because of tolerance of precision, like 0.043388 and 0.04405. In our testing environment, the biggest testing result deviation is around difference between 0.027... and 0.037... sometimes. Adjust the tolerance to fix the issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n - [X] Passed code style checking (make lint).\r\n - [X] All changes have test coverage.\r\n - [ ] Code is well-documented.","created_at":"2018-08-09T00:25:22Z","updated_at":"2018-08-12T23:21:30Z","closed_at":"2018-08-12T23:21:30Z","merged_at":"2018-08-12T23:21:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"9933d7a4db256ab89827f8490d725061144c35d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":721783490,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM0OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Test","name":"Test","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nFix for issues:\r\n #9816 Dropout may mask values even when ratio=0.0\r\n #11715 test_operator.test_dropout has fixed seed that can mask flakiness\r\n\r\nas mentioned by @DickJC123, the problem is that on the CPU and GPU the random number generator works slightly differently. On the CPU the numbers are generated in the range [0,1) and on the GPU they are (0,1]. Therefor on the GPU a value of 1 can be generated and using the existing thresholding mshadow operator this results in an incorrect value since its only performing < operation. \r\n\r\nThis fix adds a <= comparison for dropout to fix this issue. \r\n\r\nAnother possible solution is to match the random number generator behavior between CPU and GPU, for which there is already a PR in the mshadow repo: https://github.com/dmlc/mshadow/pull/338\r\n\r\nWhen this PR gets merged the behavior of dropout with this fix will still be the same. So this fix works now and in the future.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nadded mshadow op for threshold_eq (theshold currently does <, this will do <=)\r\n\r\nmodified dropout operator to use threshold_eq instead of theshold this will ensure equivalent behavior for the random numbers generated on CPU [0, 1) and GPU (0, 1]\r\n\r\nremoved fixed seed for test_dropout\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nUpdates pick operator to handle negative indices. \r\nImplements #12009 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nUpdates pick and pick_grad in broadcast_reduce_op to handle negative indices\r\nUpdates pick to include a mode parameter ('pick' or 'wrap') to specify whether out of bounds indices should either be clipped or wrapped.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nMaking change as it was tagged with `Call for

for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTest on CPU:\r\n[DEBUG] 10000 of 10000: Setting test np/mx/python random seeds, use

Having a platform-independent way of querying this (eg to automatically figure out appropriate batch sizes) is very useful for higher-level frameworks built on top of MXNet.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the cuTorch function [getMemoryUsage](https://github.com/torch/cutorch/blob/7126f4bc02757838dd597d94e5d8ee67b45e0388/init.c#L710), with the same implementation.

Description ##\r\nThis PR is to fix the MKLDNNSum cpp test failure reported by https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11998, it is caused by a race condition in MKLDNNSum test case implementation that two threads (asynchronous engine thread and main thread) try to modify one NDArray at the same time (detailed analysis please see https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11998#issuecomment-411313201), the fix is to add barrier to wait for asynchronous engine thread Copy operation to finish before executing further operations.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThis PR corrects the usage of `CutSubgraph`.\r\n\r\n`CutSubgraph` consumes a Symbol `s`, and\r\n1) Assumes the attribute `__subgraph_name__` of `s->outputs[0].node` is the name of the subgraph\r\n2) Assumes the boundary of this subgraph be nodes who has at least one immediate predecessor whose attribute `__subgraph_name__` is not the name of the subgraph\r\n3) Duplicates and puts these immediate predecessors into this subgraph\r\n\r\nCalling `CutSubgraph` without very special care will cause disastrous consequences, often when `s->outputa[0].node` has an improper name. For example, in control flow operators, if we write a function `lambda: x` which captures an outside symbol `x` (so the attribute of `x` is not desirable), and an operator passes `x` into `CutGraph` as the first output of subgraph, the entire procedure breaks. Without copying and manually correcting such symbols, this will happen anywhere and be very hard to debug. An example that causes this bug could be https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/pull/233 in which the `pred` I pass to `cond` is calculated outside the subgraph.\r\n\r\nThis bug affects all three control flow operators, `foreach`, `while_loop` and `cond`.\r\n\r\nCC: @zheng-da \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] 3 control flow operators.\r\n- [x] BTW, remove some unnecessary copies of std::string in the implementation of CutSubgraph.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Just looked into the code, seems that another thing we haven't ensure is that each subgraph should have its distinct name, otherwise the CutSubgraph may not work properly.

Description ##\r\nThe output of summary in Gluon Block counts the number of parameters in forward computation graph, which may be confusing with the number of parameter in the model. Especially for RNN models, the number of parameters in forward computation graph will change based on the input length. This can be misleading to the users. In this PR, I slightly modify the print info to clarify it and add unique number of parameters in the model to the print output.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-08T02:56:56Z","updated_at":"2018-08-09T22:44:22Z","closed_at":"2018-08-09T22:44:21Z","merged_at":"2018-08-09T22:44:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"23b8f8977174b85cb57fd625a9ccef30b4a47c0c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":708228884,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgyMjg4ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Gluon","name":"Gluon","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR
