fixes 42984a821b3e73aee2966d11d7fb436b5ff22b68, which refactored the Dataflow runner build scripts to share a common buildAndPushDockerContainer task. However the task internally uses a dockerImageContainer variable which was not shared between projects and incorrectly duplicated: the generated name has an embedded timestamp, which will be re-evaluated per-project.\r\n\r\nThis change refactors the projects to also share a single dockerImageContainer property.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

seems that metrics results of the same name and type (counter/distribution) can be created and this currently causes errors. I described this in an issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-6022\r\n\r\nDue to this fact, I'm looking for a sensible way to solve this problem.\r\n\r\n@swegner could you take a look? Taking the 6022 issue into account, do you think this is the right solution?\r\n\r\nCC: @aaltay \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

notes: https://github.com/palantir/gradle-docker/releases\r\n\r\nThis upgrade is not necessary for any particular functionality. But\r\nstaying up-to-date is generally preferred.\r\n\r\nI was investigating whether recent versions of the plugin had better\r\nsupport for Gradle output caching-- currently the Docker commands will\r\nre-run on every build because they do not declare any outputs. It\r\ndoesn't appear that the most recent versions are any better.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

sure parseResponse(response) is repeatable by making the following changes:\r\n* Wrapped the HttpEntity in a BufferedHttpEntity object\r\n* Refactored parseResponse() to take a HttpEntity as input\r\n* Refactored RetryPredicate.test() to take a HttpEntity as input\r\n* Refactored checkForErrors() to take a HttpEntity as input\r\n* Adjusted tests to pass HttpEntity instead of Response object\r\n\r\nA unit test was added in which valid writes are done when the retryConfiguration is set.\r\n@aalbatross @timrobertson100 \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist

did some profiling of a spark job and 90% of the application time was spent on side input deserialization.  \r\n\r\nFor spark, an easy fix is to cache materialized side inputs per bundle. This improved running time of the profiled job from 3 hours to 30 minutes.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

- Please review. Thank-you.\r\n- Noticed an issue while reading around 1000 files from S3.\r\n- Started getting connection timeouts as the max number of open connections is set to 50.\r\n- Inside https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/runners/flink/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/flink/translation/wrappers/streaming/io/UnboundedSourceWrapper.java#L250 , we open all the readers simultaneously. Thats the intended behavior for an unbounded source. But when it comes to reading a bounded source (eg. Doing reads from S3), opening all connections at the same time leads to connections not available when the number of files we are trying to open is greater than the maxHttpConnections possible which by default is set to 50 (ClientConfiguration.`DEFAULT_MAX_CONNECTIONS`) and there isn't a way to override it [We should have the ability to override this anyways. Will create a separate PR for that.]. \r\n- The Change essentially gives the `BoundedToUnboundedSourceAdapter` an `ArrayDeque` so that one reader can read more than 1 `BoundedSource`. Each Reader finishes reading from a `BoundedSource` and then goes to the next one.\r\n- In case of check-pointing, if a reader has elements that aren't read yet from a `BoundedSource`, we create a checkpoint with the remaining elements of the `BoundedSource` and the elements remaining in the `ArrayDequeue`.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

duplicate counters from different stages in streaming.\r\n\r\nStreaming Dataflow worker sends counters from all the stages together in a single RCP to Dataflow service. In certain graph optimizations, same step could be part of multiple fused stages stages. If the counter definition does not include fused stage name, there could be multiple counters with the same definition (which might be as intended since they belong to the same logical step). The Dataflow Service does not expect duplicate counters and warns about since such a duplication never expected in batch pipelines. This PR updates StreamingDataflowWorker to send duplicate counters in a separate RPCs. \r\n\r\n+R: @matthewlang @edre \r\nDataflow bugid: b/118462578, cl:

SDK harness was limited to elements of at most ~4MB with this check, but provided no means to increase it. The chunking is valuable for batching tiny elements over RPCs to improve throughput but is less meaningful for larger elements.\r\nThe Go SDK shouldn't be dictating maximum element size, and let that be configurable by the FnAPI transport (eg. GRPC) to the runner harness instead. This should have an implicit ~2-4GB cap on element size.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

PR contains some progress regarding the porting of the io package. The parsing of avro schema's remains a source of errors, but this commit already solves some issues associated with avro schema parsing and the codecs. The remainder of these issues can now be traced back to the testing/util module, which I will detail below for us to discuss.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a series of PRs with the goal to make Apache Beam PY3 compatible. The proposal with the outlined approach has been documented [here](https://s.apache.org/beam-python-3).\r\n\r\n@tvalentyn @Fematich @aaltay @manuzhang @RobbeSneyders \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status

the Java SDK, the Filesystems.match facilities are aimed primarily at listing file names and collect very limited additional metadata from the filesystem (sizeBytes and isReadSeekEfficient). This PR adds a new `lastModified` field to that list.\r\n\r\nThis could be a basis for a future improvement to FileIO.match(...).continuously(...) where we could let the user opt to poll not just for new file names, but also for existing file names if their content has been updated.\r\n\r\nIn the near term, the addition of lastModified to Metadata will allow users to implement their own polling logic on top of Filesystems.match to detect and download new files from any of the supported filesystems.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

adds a Nexmark benchmark which joins the stream of bids to fake side input data that just maps integers to their string representation.\r\n\r\nOpening PR for early feedback; I have some TODOs:\r\n\r\n - Wire it up to the PipelineOptions\r\n - Maybe make the side input more abstract bounded side input, not just files, for sanity and testing\r\n - The tests become flaky and start failing as side input rows increases, so I have bug\r\n\r\nBut LMK if I am plugging in to Nexmark in the expected ways.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your
