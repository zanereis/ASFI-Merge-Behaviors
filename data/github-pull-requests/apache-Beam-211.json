turns on exact format enforcement, and also provides the Gradle one line command to do it.\r\n\r\nIt isn't (just) about code layout, it is about automation. We have pretty strict style rules enforced by checkstyle. The most efficient way to fix up a file is with autoformat. But if the autoformat hits a bunch of irrelevant lines, that is annoying for a reviewer and obscures `git blame`.\r\n\r\nIf we enforce autoformat all the time, then it makes sure that autoformatting a particular PR has minimal effects and is always safe to do.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

The two forms I've tested are UNNEST of constants and simple correlated UNNEST of a column.\r\n\r\nThere are some hacks about assuming the form of plan that UNNEST has.

* Add a Python ValidatesContainer-style script to build the Go container around the integration tests. It uses the same bash logic for consistency, but ideally we'd have a better solution for building containers for integration tests shared across the SDKs.\r\n * Add another Gradle build file to build the linux_amd64 Go integration test worker with a fixed name. This separation makes it easier to invoke the correct test driver from the script, because we don't have to figure out what the host platform and architecture is. It didn't seem possible to do this from a single Gradle build file.\r\n\r\nDesign notes:

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-17T21:45:28Z","updated_at":"2018-06-13T20:24:04Z","closed_at":"2018-05-17T23:02:38Z","merged_at":"2018-05-17T23:02:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"1ae381676473d69cd77347af1cfca2c53bb0ea4d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5403/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5403/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5403/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/4b7a424184073c65de18a2bf48bf0e0b17817c81","head":{"label":"swegner:remove_stale_comment","ref":"remove_stale_comment","sha":"4b7a424184073c65de18a2bf48bf0e0b17817c81","user":{"login":"swegner","id":674021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDAyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner","html_url":"https://github.com/swegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52832170,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjgzMjE3MA==","name":"beam","full_name":"swegner/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"swegner","id":674021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDAyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner","html_url":"https://github.com/swegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/swegner/beam","description":"Mirror

is an attempt to fix release build issues described in [BEAM-4328](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-4328). I don't have any confidence that it fixes the build. But it might, and it's general goodness to keep our dependencies up-to-date.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass.

easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-17T18:01:25Z","updated_at":"2019-08-27T00:38:00Z","closed_at":"2018-05-17T19:45:47Z","merged_at":"2018-05-17T19:45:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"eded06c34db420cbe17b985a1494ab7e3e559fb4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5398/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5398/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5398/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/a15b6139872d17ebdb34cb83ce371c17cf42236d","head":{"label":"tvalentyn:patch-14","ref":"patch-14","sha":"a15b6139872d17ebdb34cb83ce371c17cf42236d","user":{"login":"tvalentyn","id":9408864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDg4NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9408864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn","html_url":"https://github.com/tvalentyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":81976592,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTk3NjU5Mg==","name":"beam","full_name":"tvalentyn/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tvalentyn","id":9408864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDg4NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9408864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn","html_url":"https://github.com/tvalentyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tvalentyn/beam","description":"Mirror
