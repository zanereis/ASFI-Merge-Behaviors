checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-02T23:42:15Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T23:37:33Z","closed_at":"2018-07-06T23:37:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"df1c923bd3b364c21db87ca0eecb8a7f74daa3cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":974794430,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzQ3OTQ0MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4994/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4994/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4994/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/fb675053cdd17731ff5bba0ad579125eb5c09359","head":{"label":"robertwb:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"fb675053cdd17731ff5bba0ad579125eb5c09359","user":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54749372,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDc0OTM3Mg==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"robertwb/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

PR lays out a POC to add an ExecutionContext and a StepMetadataRegistry to the Python SDK. If this is acceptable, next steps are:\r\n\r\n1. `JsonLogFormatter` no longer relies on `per_thread_worker_data`, instead on `sampler = statesampler.get_current_tracker()`(see [PR 4387](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4387)) to get the current step name, and gets the metadata from the execution_context.\r\n\r\n2. Clean up of `per_thread_worker_data`.\r\n\r\nThere are no changes in functionality, but it lays out the basis to remove `PerThreadLoggingContext` from the global state, and instead relying on `StateSampler` as the only global state that provides the step name, and logging (and other components) won't need to set their own global context.\r\n\r\nr: @charlesccychen \r\nWhat do you think

few changes to the tables interface to support adding BigQuery as a table type.\r\n\r\n1. IOWriter outputs the POutput interfaces instead of the PDone type. PDone is just one of the POutput types, BigQuery has its own implementation of POutput.\r\n2. Treat Location as a string instead of a URI. The format of a BigQuery table name is `[PROJECT_ID]:[DATASET].[TABLE]`. Treating the field as a type specific opaque string allows us to support this format as well.\r\n\r\nFollowup PR #4947 adds actual BigQuery support.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).

pull request is the result of applying the [automatic conversion provided by the future package](http://python-future.org/overview.html#automatic-conversion-to-py2-3-compatible-code) to the coders subpackage, after which all python 2 errors were fixed. The result is python 3 styled code with python 2 compatibility.\r\nThis pull request is the first of a series in which all subpackages will be updated. We should therefore discuss the chosen approach, so we can agree on one strategy to apply throughout.\r\n\r\nThe approach I've taken, is to focus on writing python 3 code with python 2 compatibility:\r\n\r\n- The future package provides tools to forward-port our code, while the six package focuses more on backporting. I've therefore replaced six with future everywhere it was already used.\r\n\r\n- One of the biggest problems in porting python 2 code to python 3, is the changed handling of strings and bytes. To get a consistent behavior between versions, I have tried to rewrite everything to use the `str` and `bytes` type provided by the future.builtins package. I have not used the `from __future__ import unicode_literals` import since [its changes are too implicit and introduces a risk of subtle regressions on python 2](http://python-future.org/unicode_literals.html)\r\n\r\nI started out with running futurize on the complete coders subpackage and then tried to fix the errors introduced by the automatic conversion. This however proved to be difficult, because it's not obvious where certain errors were introduced. \r\nI therefore switched to a per module approach, in which I first updated all non-test modules. This way, I could check if everything still ran with the native python 2 tests. Afterwards, I updated all test modules.\r\n\r\nThis pull request also contains updates to run_pylint.sh and tox.ini, so pylint can be run with the --py3k parameter. This should help avoid regression between the different steps of the update process.","created_at":"2018-04-02T18:52:02Z","updated_at":"2018-04-09T14:41:42Z","closed_at":"2018-04-09T14:41:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cbdfd6e8d8c047d96833fdccf122616520d1ab81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4990/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4990/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4990/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/348605f94883a2166ad00705fa0cdb406a7a6da4","head":{"label":"RobbeSneyders:master","ref":"master","sha":"348605f94883a2166ad00705fa0cdb406a7a6da4","user":{"login":"RobbeSneyders","id":20990866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTkwODY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20990866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders","html_url":"https://github.com/RobbeSneyders","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114748525,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ3NDg1MjU=","name":"beam","full_name":"RobbeSneyders/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RobbeSneyders","id":20990866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTkwODY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20990866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders","html_url":"https://github.com/RobbeSneyders","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobbeSneyders/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RobbeSneyders/beam","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-30T23:08:27Z","updated_at":"2018-05-07T21:07:03Z","closed_at":"2018-05-07T21:06:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e4a0b880e9be7aedd5c1f2d468caa92d64b309c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4987/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4987/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4987/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/df114cd9c9400aa80b2d284c3a3ee5ee880a5823","head":{"label":"udim:postcommit-unpin","ref":"postcommit-unpin","sha":"df114cd9c9400aa80b2d284c3a3ee5ee880a5823","user":{"login":"udim","id":127695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzY5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim","html_url":"https://github.com/udim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105834738,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU4MzQ3Mzg=","name":"beam","full_name":"udim/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"udim","id":127695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzY5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim","html_url":"https://github.com/udim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/udim/beam","description":"Mirror

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-30T16:21:14Z","updated_at":"2018-03-30T16:38:43Z","closed_at":"2018-03-30T16:38:43Z","merged_at":"2018-03-30T16:38:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"81e7b439a67f1f14eba097b069df1a13f7aeed73","assignee":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4981/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4981/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4981/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/58964888c9d252af7f1e42369cc9d8ec43eed7aa","head":{"label":"tgroh:backwards_compat_metric_name","ref":"backwards_compat_metric_name","sha":"58964888c9d252af7f1e42369cc9d8ec43eed7aa","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52644388,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NDM4OA==","name":"beam","full_name":"tgroh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh/beam","description":"Mirror

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-30T03:07:08Z","updated_at":"2018-04-03T17:25:47Z","closed_at":"2018-04-03T17:25:47Z","merged_at":"2018-04-03T17:25:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"def98a0a5430b7127ce65ac264205dce930dd071","assignee":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4980/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4980/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4980/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/55bf203512423789aa52b45381233a7aced3b9eb","head":{"label":"angoenka:multiprocess_harness","ref":"multiprocess_harness","sha":"55bf203512423789aa52b45381233a7aced3b9eb","user":{"login":"angoenka","id":38219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka","html_url":"https://github.com/angoenka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108601385,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDg2MDEzODU=","name":"beam","full_name":"angoenka/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"angoenka","id":38219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka","html_url":"https://github.com/angoenka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/angoenka/beam","description":"Mirror

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

are implicitly unzipped during fusion, by as aggressively as possible\r\nfusing them into any stage that produces one of their inputs. This may lead\r\nto multiple stages producing the same output PCollection (in fact, if a flatten\r\nhas inputs that are not all in the same stage, this is guaranteed to happen).\r\n\r\nBecause utilities expect exactly one PTransform to produce any given PCollection,\r\nthis behavior breaks those utilities due to mismatched preconditions. This inserts\r\na synthetic flatten node to flatten together all of the partial PCollections produced\r\nby each flatten input, executed in the runner, and introduces a synthetic PCollection\r\nfor each of the locations the flatten exists within as the only producer of that output.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-29T15:28:58Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T12:22:27Z","closed_at":"2018-06-29T08:34:52Z","merged_at":"2018-06-29T08:34:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"627d4eed7db7d6072c0b98762c94ea2472d530dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4976/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4976/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4976/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/155ffd1086d9221ed6b91a8354a1c3e7ebe44374","head":{"label":"echauchot:schedule_nexmark_runs","ref":"schedule_nexmark_runs","sha":"155ffd1086d9221ed6b91a8354a1c3e7ebe44374","user":{"login":"echauchot","id":8821084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjEwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot","html_url":"https://github.com/echauchot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":68310413,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2ODMxMDQxMw==","name":"beam","full_name":"echauchot/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"echauchot","id":8821084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjEwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot","html_url":"https://github.com/echauchot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/echauchot/beam","description":"Mirror

[x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-28T12:53:15Z","updated_at":"2018-05-18T08:14:43Z","closed_at":"2018-04-13T14:29:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a4ffa067f835c83e8f3abd9048d252907c584fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4967/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4967/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4967/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/20ccd78500603531bc47d82bbedbdc2c97327276","head":{"label":"echauchot:unschedule_IT_in_pre_commit","ref":"unschedule_IT_in_pre_commit","sha":"20ccd78500603531bc47d82bbedbdc2c97327276","user":{"login":"echauchot","id":8821084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjEwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot","html_url":"https://github.com/echauchot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":68310413,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2ODMxMDQxMw==","name":"beam","full_name":"echauchot/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"echauchot","id":8821084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjEwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot","html_url":"https://github.com/echauchot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/echauchot/beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

implements the design [specified in BEAM-3201](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-3201) to provide per-document control of the target index, type and the identifier used for the document.\r\n\r\nJustification and discussion is provided on the Jira issue but summarised as:\r\n\r\n- Document ID control is required to 1) explicitly control identifiers in Elasticsearch enabling document updates and 2) to enable ability ensuring that failure/retry scenarios do not result in duplicate documents.\r\n- Per document index/routing enables high throughput without repartitioning the PCollection for target instances which has proven unpractical in production\r\n\r\nPlease note that the tests provided run pipelines rather then running `DoFn` unit tests. I understood this was the preferred mechanism, but if not I would appreciate a link to an example of the preferred way and I will rework them. \r\n\r\nThis work builds on ideas from previous but incomplete work of @chetaldrich with some changes as noted in the Jira. The initial work of Chet made this implementation easy. Thanks Chet!\r\n\r\nPerhaps @echauchot @jkff could coordinate a review of this please?\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-27T10:40:50Z","updated_at":"2018-05-17T09:35:37Z","closed_at":"2018-04-11T07:17:53Z","merged_at":"2018-04-11T07:17:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"5c5c54e9ad4e1e2fec920774d016be39c96f6b03","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4956/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4956/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4956/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/f620efd1d2eb2cc89b3edd75876f64cd1f9c579d","head":{"label":"timrobertson100:BEAM-3201","ref":"BEAM-3201","sha":"f620efd1d2eb2cc89b3edd75876f64cd1f9c579d","user":{"login":"timrobertson100","id":237221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/237221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100","html_url":"https://github.com/timrobertson100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":125667444,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjU2Njc0NDQ=","name":"beam","full_name":"timrobertson100/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"timrobertson100","id":237221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/237221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100","html_url":"https://github.com/timrobertson100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timrobertson100/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/timrobertson100/beam","description":"Apache

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\nIn the 2.4.0 release, we have added Wheel files for Python SDK. Changes in this pull request aim to automate the Quickstarts and MobileGaming examples to make an easy release validation process.\r\n\r\nGeneral workflow:\r\n1. download & validate sha512 and gpg keys\r\n2. setup virtualenv & install python sdk (tar)\r\n3. run wordcount and streaming wordcount on core runners (direct, dataflow)\r\n4. run userscore, leader_board and hourly_team_score on core runnres\r\n5. repeat from the step 2 to validate wheel versions.\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor changes:\r\n1. change herachy of python automation shell scripts, release/src/main/groovy -> release/src/main/python-release\r\n2. Functionalize each steps of quickstart and mobile-gaming validation in purpose of reusing code for wheel validations.\r\n3. Add validations for wheel files.\r\n\r\nr: @aaltay \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n  - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is

a policy for  custom timestamps & `CreateTime` timestamps. This is useful most common situations for users to use directly.  Changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n-  `TimestampPolicyFactory` is changed to a `@FunctionalInterface` so that it is lambda friendly. (e.g. `.withTimetstampFactory((ts, prevWatermark) -> new MyTimestampPolicy(..))`\r\n- Added `CustomTimestmpPolicyWithLimitedDelay` : built in custom timestamp policy where the timestamps are expected to be roughly monotonic, with a bound on maximum delay/skew. This handles advancing watermark when a partition is idle. \r\n   - The policy itself is fairly simple : keep advancing the watermark to `max_event_time - maxDelay`. The two special cases are future timestamps & idle partitions.\r\n - '.withCreateTime(maxDelay)` method for reader builder. This is useful to handle `CREATE_TIME` timestamps in Kafka. An instance of  `CustomTimestmpPolicyWithLimitedDelay`.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-22T07:02:29Z","updated_at":"2018-03-30T16:58:19Z","closed_at":"2018-03-30T16:58:19Z","merged_at":"2018-03-30T16:58:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"716a269aa76eacc7b4e2e911af8eb878c4364abe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4935/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4935/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4935/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/fc3bfd7f394620007d927c09daf2f3415fae1bd1","head":{"label":"rangadi:custom_timestamps","ref":"custom_timestamps","sha":"fc3bfd7f394620007d927c09daf2f3415fae1bd1","user":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53447194,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzQ0NzE5NA==","name":"beam","full_name":"rangadi/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi/beam","description":"Mirror

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Python end-to-end testing framework to support streaming pipelines that use PubSub. \r\n\r\nImprovements are:\r\n- Add `PubSubMessageMatcher` which is a customized hamcrest matcher to pull messages from given subscription and verify content.\r\n- Auto-cancel streaming pipeline by test framework after all matchers are verified.\r\n- Few minor improvements and cleanup in `TestDataflowRunner`\r\n\r\n`StreamingWordCountITTest` can verify output messages and cancel pipeline after this change. The overall test workflow is:\r\n\r\n1. Set up PubSub topics and subscriptions.\r\n1. Build test options including required pipeline options and test verifiers.\r\n1. Inject data to input topic.\r\n1. Call `StreamingWordCount.run` with above options to start the pipeline.\r\n1. Wait until pipeline start running.\r\n1. Run verifiers.\r\n1. Cancel streaming job.\r\n1. Cleanup PubSub topics and subscriptions.\r\n\r\nNote: If other two improvement PRs ([PR-4921](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4921), [PR-4922](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4922)) are merged before this one, rebase is required before merging.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

- [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

changing the portable model for Combines to one without side inputs (details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-3mEs3Y7bIkJ0hmQ6SiHpVIFu5vbY6Zcpw-7tOMVg4U/edit?usp=sharing)). Also without Parameters, but that doesn't seem to be used at all, so not much of a change there.\r\n\r\nIn order to have the model continue working without the side inputs I made these changes:\r\n\r\n- Removed all mention of side inputs from CombinePayload and added checks so that to-proto translation of Combines with side inputs won't work.\r\n- Changed CombineTranslation.translate to return an empty FunctionSpec instead if the Combine has side inputs. This means combines with side inputs are now passed to the runner as unknown composite transforms. (Note that this differs from the doc which mentions completely removing the composite from side input combines. This approach is much easier with the current code, and the focus of this PR is getting side inputs out of CombinePayload, so the rest will be done in other PRs.)\r\n- CombineTranslation.getSideInputs was completely removed, so some changes were made to the Flink runner to adjust for the fact that Combines will no longer have side inputs. The changes made there were very simple since it was intended just to have things compile with the change, so some refactoring should probably be done there in the future.\r\n- Finally, updated the CombineTranslation tests to account for these changes by making sure the existing tests don't use side inputs and adding a new test to ensure that side inputs fail in the to-proto translation.\r\n\r\nI ran tests and validation for Java, but wasn't getting the Python tests and validation to work. A cursory look at Python didn't see any mention of side inputs along with CombinePayload, so I'm crossing my fingers.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-21T17:51:05Z","updated_at":"2018-03-22T16:54:58Z","closed_at":"2018-03-22T16:54:58Z","merged_at":"2018-03-22T16:54:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"e49ed3c01ec3a5328f10e6f7fd76c4a8aaf3e704","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4922/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4922/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4922/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/be366c60566ec9ce4343b9b2f655593bd237c166","head":{"label":"markflyhigh:py-swc-it-ps-wait","ref":"py-swc-it-ps-wait","sha":"be366c60566ec9ce4343b9b2f655593bd237c166","user":{"login":"markflyhigh","id":4008895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDg4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4008895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh","html_url":"https://github.com/markflyhigh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61327747,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTMyNzc0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"markflyhigh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"markflyhigh","id":4008895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDg4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4008895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh","html_url":"https://github.com/markflyhigh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/markflyhigh/beam","description":"Apache

clean up of job terminal state check in TestDataflowRunner in Python SDK as discussion in [PR](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4874#discussion_r175590831).\r\n\r\n- Make `DataflowPipelineResult._is_in_terminal_state` public.\r\n- Use it in TestDataflowRunner instead of creating own state check function.\r\n- This change can also help to address this [TODO](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/dataflow/dataflow_runner.py#L1073).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-21T17:24:28Z","updated_at":"2018-03-21T23:54:12Z","closed_at":"2018-03-21T23:54:11Z","merged_at":"2018-03-21T23:54:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"9a94ade6120f528c3a8702ae44d1313685da6d97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4921/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4921/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4921/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/74185d2444154d779570f7aa8c142fc2dd4d157c","head":{"label":"markflyhigh:py-swc-it-improve","ref":"py-swc-it-improve","sha":"74185d2444154d779570f7aa8c142fc2dd4d157c","user":{"login":"markflyhigh","id":4008895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDg4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4008895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh","html_url":"https://github.com/markflyhigh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61327747,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTMyNzc0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"markflyhigh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"markflyhigh","id":4008895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDg4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4008895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh","html_url":"https://github.com/markflyhigh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/markflyhigh/beam","description":"Apache

easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

minor issues from #4844.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License
