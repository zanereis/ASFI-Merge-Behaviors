are multiple instances where cmake variables are used as a combination boolean and/or path specifier. The code checks for a boolean by doing a string comparison with \"ON\" or \"OFF\" but cmake booleans can have many more values than these.\r\nFrom the cmake docs:\r\n`True if the constant is 1, ON, YES, TRUE, Y, or a non-zero number. False if the constant is 0, OFF, NO, FALSE, N, IGNORE, NOTFOUND, the empty string, or ends in the suffix -NOTFOUND. Named boolean constants are case-insensitive`\r\n~I added a new cmake function `decompose_args` which decomposes a cmake variable like USE_LLVM which could be a bool or an executable file into two cmake variables, a boolean and a `command`. This makes it easier to assemble the correct conditionals to use the values and also handles all valid boolean values for true and false.~\r\nSince cmake does not have a way to check if a boolean is false, only that it is not true, I added a `IS_BOOLEAN_PATTERN` regex containing all valid cmake false values. If code needs to check for explicit false (as is the case where the variable could be either a boolean or a string) then you can use the snippet:\r\n`if(${MY_VAR} MATCHES ${IS_BOOLEAN_PATTERN})`\r\nwhich will return true iff the value is a valid cmake false value.\r\n\r\nThe result allows the following to work as expected:\r\n```\r\ncmake .. -DUSE_LLVM=1                     (use the default llvm finder)\r\ncmake .. -DUSE_LLVM=llvm-config           (if llvm-config is in the path)\r\ncmake .. -DUSE_LLVM=/path/to/llvm-config  (use the explicit llvm-config)\r\ncmake .. -DUSE_LLVM=False                 (do not use llvm)\r\n```\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-18T21:59:58Z","updated_at":"2020-09-25T05:08:13Z","closed_at":"2020-09-25T05:08:13Z","merged_at":"2020-09-25T05:08:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"e308dd2b1b1d43788da290d861c7571acb620ca1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6515/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6515/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6515/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/be2e2ccf03b321d9541f1a9e26b3ace2d6c53e71","head":{"label":"rkimball:bob/cmake_find_funcs","ref":"bob/cmake_find_funcs","sha":"be2e2ccf03b321d9541f1a9e26b3ace2d6c53e71","user":{"login":"rkimball","id":15673563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjczNTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15673563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball","html_url":"https://github.com/rkimball","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"292b640f1338317af6d90cc3f4e96f0bacde4ca4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70746484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDc0NjQ4NA==","name":"tvm","full_name":"apache/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm","description":"Open

Following the discussion there, I attempted to clean up that usage with a new wrapper API. I think this is a reasonable change to add. \r\n\r\nThe following API is added. If this looks good, I'll add a doc string.

PR fixes some issues I encountered when running `git-black.sh` on `bash`:\r\n\r\n1. A syntax error (an unexpected \")\") in a message. This seems fine on `zsh` but causes crash on `bash`.\r\n2. A guard to prevent failure when no changes in Python file (`$FILES` would be an unbound variable).\r\n3. (second commit in this PR) Remove `HEAD` in the command of listing changed Python files so that it will also cover upstaged changes.\r\n\r\nWhile the first two points may fail the CI, the third point is optional. I just feel that it's more convenient for people to format their changes before making a commit.

High level description of the submission\r\nWe added two new intrinsics in: `topi/arm_cpu/tensor_intrin.py`, namely\r\n- `mmla4x4`: compute a matrix multiplication between tile `A(4,4)` and tile\r\n  `B(4,4)`\r\n- `mmla16x4`: compute a matrix multiplication between tile `A(rows,4)` and tile\r\n  `B(4,16)`\r\nThen we used those intrinsics in two separate strategies. We added the\r\nstrategies in `topi/arm_cpu/conv2d_int8.py` and implemented the schedules\r\nin `topi/arm_cpu/conv2d_gemm.py`. In particular:\r\n- `schedule_conv2d_gemm`, when accelerated, packs matrix `A`, compute GEMM,\r\n  and unpack the resulting matrix. This uses the `mmla4x4` intrinsic\r\n- `schedule_conv2d_gemm_hybrid` doesn't do any packing on `A` and `C` which\r\n  are in native form.  This uses the `mmla16x4` intrinsic\r\n\r\nPlease note that for the limitations of `tensorize` we need to pad\r\nmatrix `A` in both cases (when dimensions are not multiple of the tiling\r\nshape)\r\n\r\n### RFC\r\nThis PR is based on the following RFC: https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-accelerate-quantized-convolution-through-dot-product/7873\r\n\r\nChange-Id:

is a fix to the issue reported in https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/issues/6432\r\n\r\nFirst, Relay stack op accepts `axis` arg:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/082f27ebf8b14f537f0d7686e8161db1684f3110/python/tvm/topi/transform.py#L353-L354\r\n\r\nSince this `axis` value refers to the axis in the stacked array, the following check is not correct. The axis value can be bigger by one than the input dimension. \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/eee413f9d9f1157b777737adf39060dda1991841/src/relay/op/tensor/transform.cc#L298-L299\r\n\r\nI believe the correct check should be \r\n```\r\n  CHECK(-(ndim + 1) <= axis && axis < ndim + 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond, our PyTorch frontend  currently only supports conversion of `torch::stack` for the dynamic input case. I added this conversion to support the following use case in LSTM.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/50adbfac6a533f231a930bf80617c8eb3d7097a7/tests/python/frontend/pytorch/test_lstm.py#L77-L81\r\n\r\nBut since `torch::stack` with a static tensor list like `torch.stack((x, x))` is common, I added support for that here.\r\n\r\nPlease review @siju-samuel @t-vi @junrushao1994 @Laurawly

TVM supports OpenCL and OpenCL supports accelerators in the same way as GPU or CPU devices, I think TVM should accept generic accelerators too. \r\n\r\nI made minor changes to the OpenCL c++ part in order to make TVM recognize accelerator devices. However it may deserve another pull request to overhaul the present system in order to allow the user to explicitly chose between which device type to use.\r\nIn addition I noticed that CUDA, and therefore OpenCL, schedules used sometimes hardcoded constants for the number of threads. While it is acceptable for GPU that have many threads available, it is not for generic accelerators that may have a small number of threads (as low as 16 for example). I tried to make these constants more flexible by using the max_num_threads of the target kind.","created_at":"2020-09-07T12:52:33Z","updated_at":"2022-01-09T22:18:52Z","closed_at":"2022-01-09T22:18:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"066b861c4a68d9d1e87cf35adb53fdae1cdb2ba9","assignee":{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6412/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6412/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6412/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/df4b8076ba729d94de58a9e99306e37a1c747101","head":{"label":"aurel333:master","ref":"master","sha":"df4b8076ba729d94de58a9e99306e37a1c747101","user":{"login":"aurel333","id":47594907,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NTk0OTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47594907?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333","html_url":"https://github.com/aurel333","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":293457060,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTM0NTcwNjA=","name":"incubator-tvm","full_name":"aurel333/incubator-tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aurel333","id":47594907,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NTk0OTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47594907?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333","html_url":"https://github.com/aurel333","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurel333/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aurel333/incubator-tvm","description":"Open
