compilation is not supported. This warning can be disabled using the '--engine.WarnInterpreterOnly=false' option or the '-Dpolyglot.engine.WarnInterpreterOnly=false' system property.</li>\n<li>Added the <code>js.unhandled-rejections</code> option to track unhandled promise rejections in a polyglot <code>Context</code>. By default, the option is set to <code>none</code>, and unhandled promise rejections are not tracked.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-set-methods\">New Set Methods</a> proposal. It is available behind an experimental flag (<code>--js.new-set-methods</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented experimental operator overloading support.

from 2.13.3 to 2.13.5 (thanks to sullis for pull request)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded Kotlin from 1.3.72 to 1.5.0</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a bug preventing you to specify &quot;fib(-1)&quot; when using the fibonacci poll interval (thanks to Björn Michael for pull request) (issue 201)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added support for fail-fast conditions. This is a special condition that, if fulfilled, will throw a &quot;org.awaitility.core.TerminalFailureException&quot; immediately, thus failing the test.\nThis is good when you have a condition that you know beforehand should never be fulfilled. So instead of waiting the full duration of a normal condition evaluation period, the test will fail\nfaster if this (fail fast) condition evaluates to true. For example:</p>\n<p>await().timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5)).failFast(() -&gt; orders.findById(1234).state == PAID).until(() -&gt; orders.findById(1234).state == CLOSED);</p>\n<p>This will fail-fast if the state of order 1234 is ever equal to &quot;PAID&quot; during the 5 second evaluation of the condition specified in &quot;until&quot;.\n(Thanks to Antony Stubbs for initial pull request) (issue 178)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded Groovy from version 3.0.4 to 3.0.8</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commits/awaitility-4.1.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=org.awaitility:awaitility&package-manager=maven&previous-version=4.0.3&new-version=4.1.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
