current in-process launcher implementation just calls the SparkSubmit\r\nobject, which, in case of errors, will more often than not exit the JVM.\r\nThis is not desirable since this launcher is meant to be used inside other\r\napplications, and that would kill the application.\r\n\r\nThe change turns SparkSubmit into a class, and abstracts aways some of\r\nthe functionality used to print error messages and abort the submission\r\nprocess. The default implementation uses the logging system for messages,\r\nand throws exceptions for errors. As part of that I also moved some code\r\nthat doesn't really belong in SparkSubmit to a better location.\r\n\r\nThe command line invocation of spark-submit now uses a special implementation\r\nof the SparkSubmit class that overrides those behaviors to do what is expected\r\nfrom the command line version (print to the terminal, exit the JVM, etc).\r\n\r\nA lot of the changes are to replace calls to methods such as \"printErrorAndExit\"\r\nwith the new API.\r\n\r\nAs part of adding tests for this, I had to fix some small things in the\r\nlauncher option parser so that things like \"--version\" can work when\r\nused in the launcher library.\r\n\r\nThere is still code that prints directly to the terminal, like all the\r\nIvy-related code in SparkSubmitUtils, and other areas where some re-factoring\r\nwould help, like the CommandLineUtils class, but I chose to leave those\r\nalone to keep this change more focused.\r\n\r\nAside from existing and added unit tests, I ran command line tools with\r\na bunch of different arguments to make sure messages and errors behave\r\nlike

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Adds a `hadoop-3.1` profile build depending on the hadoop-3.1 artifacts.\r\n1. In the hadoop-cloud module, adds an explicit hadoop-3.1 profile which switches from explicitly pulling in cloud connectors (hadoop-openstack, hadoop-aws, hadoop-azure) to depending on the hadoop-cloudstorage POM artifact, which pulls these in, has pre-excluded things like hadoop-common, and stays up to date with new connectors (hadoop-azuredatalake, hadoop-allyun). Goal: it becomes the Hadoop projects homework of keeping this clean, and the spark project doesn't need to handle new hadoop releases adding more dependencies.\r\n1. the hadoop-cloud/hadoop-3.1 profile also declares support for jetty-ajax and jetty-util to ensure that these jars get into the distribution jar directory when needed by unshaded libraries.\r\n1. Increases the curator and zookeeper versions to match those in hadoop-3, fixing spark core to build in sbt with the hadoop-3 dependencies.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* Everything this has been built and tested against both ASF Hadoop branch-3.1 and hadoop trunk.\r\n* spark-shell was used to create connectors to all the stores and verify that file IO could take place. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe spark hive-1.2.1 JAR has problems here, as it's version check logic fails for Hadoop versions > 2.\r\n\r\nThis can be avoided with either of\r\n\r\n* The hadoop JARs built to declare their version as Hadoop 2.11  `mvn install -DskipTests -DskipShade -Ddeclared.hadoop.version=2.11` . This is safe for local test runs, not for deployment (HDFS is very strict about cross-version deployment).\r\n* A modified version of spark hive whose version check switch statement is happy with hadoop 3.\r\n\r\nI've done both, with maven and SBT. \r\n\r\n\r\nThree issues surfaced\r\n\r\n1. A spark-core test failure —fixed in SPARK-23787. \r\n1. SBT only: Zookeeper not being found in spark-core. Somehow curator 2.12.0 triggers some slightly different dependency resolution logic from previous versions, and Ivy was missing zookeeper.jar entirely. This patch adds the explicit declaration for all spark profiles, setting the ZK version = 3.4.9 for hadoop-3.1\r\n1. Marking jetty-utils as provided in spark was stopping hadoop-azure from being able to instantiate the azure wasb:// client; it was using jetty-util-ajax, which could then not find a class in jetty-util.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBreaks down the construction of driver pods and executor pods in a way that uses a common abstraction for both spark-submit creating the driver and KubernetesClusterSchedulerBackend creating the executor. Encourages more code reuse and is more legible than the older approach.\r\n\r\nThe high-level design is discussed in more detail on the JIRA ticket. This pull request is the implementation of that design with some minor changes in the implementation details.\r\n\r\nNo user-facing behavior should break as a result of this change.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nMigrated all unit tests from the old submission steps architecture to the new architecture.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange pyspark-sql tests to check the following:\r\n- Spark was built with the Hive profile\r\n- Spark scala tests were compiled\r\n\r\nIf either condition is not met, throw an exception with a message explaining how to appropriately build Spark.\r\n\r\nThese checks are similar to the ones found in the pyspark-streaming tests.\r\n\r\nThese required files will be missing if you follow the sbt build instructions. They are less likely to be missing if you follow the mvn build instructions (mvn compiles the test scala files, and there are mvn build instructions for running the pyspark tests).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nFor sbt build:\r\n- run ./build/sbt package\r\n- run python/run-tests --modules \"pyspark-sql\" --python-executables python2.7\r\n- see failure, follow sbt instructions in exception message\r\n- run test again\r\n- see second failure (sbt only), follow sbt instructions in exception message\r\n- run test again, verify success\r\n- repeat for python3.4\r\n\r\nFor mvn build:\r\n- run ./build/mvn -DskipTests clean package\r\n- run python/run-tests --modules \"pyspark-sql\" --python-executables python2.7\r\n- see failure, follow mvn instructions in exception

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs stated in Jira, there are problems with current `Uuid` expression which uses `java.util.UUID.randomUUID` for UUID generation.\r\n\r\nThis patch uses the newly added `RandomUUIDGenerator` for UUID generation. So we can make `Uuid` deterministic between retries.\r\n\r\nThis backports SPARK-23599 to Spark 2.3.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests.\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-26T09:24:10Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:21:33Z","closed_at":"2018-03-26T22:28:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fb207d549ba34f07d9322f3b0739e6db990cc177","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20903/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20903/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20903/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e1fca69cf548940b712c170afc62dd7d1b38ea6b","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-23599-2.3","ref":"SPARK-23599-2.3","sha":"e1fca69cf548940b712c170afc62dd7d1b38ea6b","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently column names of headers in CSV files are not checked against provided schema of CSV data. It could cause errors like showed in the [SPARK-23786](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23786) and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20894#issuecomment-375957777. I introduced new CSV option - `enforceSchema`. If it is enabled (by default `true`), Spark forcibly applies provided or inferred schema to CSV files. In that case, CSV headers are ignored and not checked against the schema. If `enforceSchema` is set to `false`, additional checks can be performed. For example, if column in CSV header and in the schema have different ordering, the following exception is thrown:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: CSV file header does not contain the expected fields\r\n Header: depth, temperature\r\n Schema: temperature, depth\r\nCSV file: marina.csv\r\n``` \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe changes were tested by existing tests of CSVSuite and by 2 new tests.\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-23T21:14:56Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:33:48Z","closed_at":"2018-06-04T05:06:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3cb801f08aa168988ff1a7935adfaca6ec59d028","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20894/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20894/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20894/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3b37712ded664aaf716306574f50072e58b9bbd1","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:check-column-names","ref":"check-column-names","sha":"3b37712ded664aaf716306574f50072e58b9bbd1","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWaiting for merging #19222\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to use `MemoryBlock` in `TaskMemoryManager` and `UnsafeSorter` related classes. There are two advantages to use `MemoryBlock`.\r\n\r\n1. Has clean API calls rather than using a Java array or `PlatformMemory`\r\n2. Improve runtime performance of memory access instead of using `Object` with `Platform.get/put...`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUsed existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDataFrameRangeSuite.test(\"Cancelling stage in a query with Range.\") stays sometimes in an infinite loop and times out the build.\r\n\r\nThere were multiple issues with the test:\r\n\r\n1. The first valid stageId is zero when the test started alone and not in a suite and the following code waits until timeout:\r\n\r\n```\r\neventually(timeout(10.seconds), interval(1.millis)) {\r\n  assert(DataFrameRangeSuite.stageToKill > 0)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The `DataFrameRangeSuite.stageToKill` was overwritten by the task's thread after the reset which ended up in canceling the same stage 2 times.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, [TextInputJsonDataSource](https://github.com/databricks/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/json/JsonDataSource.scala#L86) uses [HadoopFileLinesReader](https://github.com/databricks/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/json/JsonDataSource.scala#L125) to split json file to separate lines. The former one [splits](https://github.com/databricks/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/json/JsonDataSource.scala#L125) json lines by [LineRecordReader](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/input/LineRecordReader.java#L68) without providing recordDelimiter. As a consequence of that, the hadoop library [reads lines terminated by one of CR, LF, or CRLF](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/util/LineReader.java#L185-L254). The changes allow to specify the line separator instead of using the auto detection method of hadoop library.  If the separator is not specified, the line separation method of Hadoop is used by default.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new tests for writing/reading json files with custom line separator","created_at":"2018-03-22T22:31:07Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:34:33Z","closed_at":"2018-03-29T14:57:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b4db00f4a5d0a823a89765ba2aadf6848f00ef75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20885/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20885/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20885/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bbff40206e6871ea9ab035e7a8876f495bdf3d90","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:json-line-sep","ref":"json-line-sep","sha":"bbff40206e6871ea9ab035e7a8876f495bdf3d90","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe found that Scalastyle was disabled in `BlockReplicationPolicy.scala` because there was a URL in there that caused the line length to be exceeded. The URL was to a `stackexchange.com` site which actually accepts shortened versions of their normal URL as well. So we could replace the URL with the officially supported shortened version and enable Scalastyle again since this no longer exceeds the line length. I also changed the URL from `http` to `https` since the site automatically redirects to `https` anyway.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWe tested this by running `./dev/lint-scala`. First we ran it with the long URL to ensure that it actually detects the violation. Then we changed this to the shortened URL and ran it again. This time it said `Scalastyle checks passed.`\r\n\r\n##

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe re-enabled the Scalastyle checker on a line of code.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove out unused codes, `_ignore_brackets_split` and `_BRACKETS`.\r\n\r\n`_ignore_brackets_split` was introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/d57daf1f7732a7ac54a91fe112deeda0a254f9ef to refactor and support `toDF(\"...\")`; however, https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/ebc124d4c44d4c84f7868f390f778c0ff5cd66cb replaced the logics here. Seems `_ignore_brackets_split` is not referred anymore.\r\n\r\n`_BRACKETS` was introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/880eabec37c69ce4e9594d7babfac291b0f93f50; however, all other usages were removed out in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/648a8626b82d27d84db3e48bccfd73d020828586.\r\n\r\nThis is rather a followup for https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/ebc124d4c44d4c84f7868f390f778c0ff5cd66cb which I missed in that PR.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add lineSep option for a configurable line separator in text datasource.\r\nIt supports this option by using `LineRecordReader`'s functionality with passing it to the constructor.\r\n\r\nThe approach is similar with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20727; however, one main difference is, it uses text datasource's `lineSep` option to parse line by line in JSON's schema inference.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested and unit tests were added.","created_at":"2018-03-22T07:10:47Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T20:32:57Z","closed_at":"2018-03-28T11:53:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"88893fcc0fb5a55b9d03a523a3937ac94f7519d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20877/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20877/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20877/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f5e7d34d0e422789fdd979a6a17ee7f48b77d0be","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:linesep-json","ref":"linesep-json","sha":"f5e7d34d0e422789fdd979a6a17ee7f48b77d0be","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

SQL UI\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[SPARK-4871](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-4871) had already added the sql statement in job description for using spark-sql. But it has some problems:\r\n\r\n1. long sql statement cannot be displayed in description column. \r\n![screen shot 2018-03-12 at 14 25 51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1853780/37287438-c833385e-263f-11e8-86ea-0f8ebb9b151e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n2. variables like `${var}`, `${env:var}` in sql cannot be resolved.\r\nspark-sql --hiveconf a=avalue --hivevar b=bvalue\r\n`spark-sql> select '${a}', '${b}';`\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-03-22 at 14 53 03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1853780/37755515-c78b7da0-2de0-11e8-807d-7e8ed3b859eb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n3. sql statement submitted in spark-shell or spark-submit cannot be covered.\r\n\r\nIn eBay, most spark sql applications like ETL, reporting using spark-submit to schedule their jobs with a few sql files. The sql statement in those applications cannot be saw in current spark UI. \r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-03-12 at 20 16 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1853780/37287410-bde5166a-263f-11e8-8435-8db29a2eef33.png)\r\n\r\nMore detail a scenario is team A developed a framework to submit application with sql sentences in a file\r\n> spark-submit --master yarn-cluster --class com.ebay.SQLFramework -s biz.sql\r\n\r\nIn the biz.sql, there are many sql sentences like\r\n> create or replace temporary view view_a select xx from table ${old_db}.table_a where dt=${check_date};\r\n> insert overwrite table ${new_db}.table_a select xx from view_a join ${new_db}.table_b;\r\n> ...\r\n\r\nTeam B (Platform) need to capture the really sql sentences which are executed in whole cluster, as the sql files from Team A contains many variables. A better way is recording the really sql sentence in EventLog.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n![screen shot 2018-03-21 at 23 22

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to use `MemoryBlock` in `OffHeapColumnVector`. There are two advantages to use `MemoryBlock`.\r\n\r\n1. Has clean API calls rather than using a Java array or `PlatformMemory`\r\n2. Improve runtime performance of memory access instead of using `Object` with `Platform.get/put...`.\r\n\r\n** TODO: I will add result of ColumnarBatchBenchmark **\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to use `MemoryBlock` in `UTF8StringBuffer`. In general, there are two advantages to use `MemoryBlock`.\r\n\r\n1. Has clean API calls rather than using a Java array or `PlatformMemory`\r\n2. Improve runtime performance of memory access instead of using `Object`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis transformation detects RI joins and eliminates the parent/PK table if none of its columns, other than the PK columns, are referenced in the query. \r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nselect fact.c1\r\nfrom fact, dim1, dim2\r\nwhere fact.c1 = dim1.pk /* FK = PK */ and\r\n      fact.c2 = dim2.pk /* FK = PK */ and\r\n      dim1.pk = 10 and\r\n      dim2.pk like ‘abc%’\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Internal optimized query after join elimination:**\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nselect fact.c1\r\nfrom fact \r\nwhere fact.c1 = 10 and fact.c2 like ‘abc%’\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe transformation will apply under the following restrictions:\r\n\r\n- No columns from the parent table are retrieved.\r\n- No columns from the parent table other than the PK columns are referenced in the predicates.\r\n- Conservatively, only allow local predicates on PK columns or equi-joins between PK columns and other tables.\r\n- The join is directly above a base table access i.e. no aliases or other expressions above base table access\r\n- Other restrictions on string data types\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA new test suite HiveRIJElimSuite.scala was introduced.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-20T23:49:05Z","updated_at":"2020-01-14T00:05:44Z","closed_at":"2020-01-14T00:05:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f80cb2c4d3d00472f742af4a12ba50668814246a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20868/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20868/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20868/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0d189ab49b2dcb748b51f875f1a04e6b2fb9f69b","head":{"label":"ioana-delaney:rijelim","ref":"rijelim","sha":"0d189ab49b2dcb748b51f875f1a04e6b2fb9f69b","user":{"login":"ioana-delaney","id":17709782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzA5Nzgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17709782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney","html_url":"https://github.com/ioana-delaney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53364696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzM2NDY5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"ioana-delaney/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ioana-delaney","id":17709782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzA5Nzgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17709782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney","html_url":"https://github.com/ioana-delaney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ioana-delaney/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR backports https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20830 to reduce the diff against master and restore the default value back in PySpark tests.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/commit/d6632d185e147fcbe6724545488ad80dce20277e added an useful util. This backport extracts and brings this util:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@contextmanager\r\ndef sql_conf(self, pairs):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nto allow configuration set/unset within a block:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith self.sql_conf({\"spark.blah.blah.blah\", \"blah\"})\r\n    # test codes\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use this util where possible in PySpark tests.\r\n\r\nNote that there look already few places affecting tests without restoring the original value back in unittest classes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nLikewise, manually tested via:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./run-tests --modules=pyspark-sql --python-executables=python2\r\n./run-tests --modules=pyspark-sql

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nisSharedClass returns if some classes can/should be shared or not. It checks if the classes names have some keywords or start with some names. Following the logic, it can occur unintended behaviors when a custom package has `slf4j` inside the package or class name. As I guess, the first intention seems to figure out the class containing `org.slf4j`. It would be better to change the comparison logic to `name.startsWith(\"org.slf4j\")`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch should pass all of the current tests and keep all of the current behaviors. In my case, I'm using ProtobufDeserializer to get a table schema from hive tables. Thus some Protobuf packages and names have `slf4j` inside. Without this patch, it cannot be resolved because of ClassCastException from different

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nForbid watermarks on both sides of stateful streaming operators.\r\n\r\nMultiple sequential watermarks are in general not supported by the execution engine; support is only in parallel, e.g. on both sides of a join. We can normally resolve this by simply picking the topmost watermark operator  and ignoring the rest, but this is not semantically valid when there's a stateful operator in between.\r\n\r\n## How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI propose new option for JSON datasource which allows to specify charset of input and output files. Here is an example of using of the option:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.read.schema(schema)\r\n  .option(\"multiline\", \"true\")\r\n  .option(\"charset\", \"UTF-16LE\")\r\n  .json(fileName)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the option is not specified, charset auto-detection mechanism is used by default.\r\n\r\nThe option can be used for saving datasets to jsons. Currently Spark is able to save datasets into json files in UTF-8 charset only. The changes allow to save data in any supported charset. Here is the approximate list of supported charsets by Oracle Java SE: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/intl/encoding.doc.html . An user can specify the charset of output jsons via the charset option like .option(\"charset\", \"UTF-16\"). By default the output charset is still UTF-8 to keep backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added the following tests:\r\n- reads an json file in UTF-16 charset with BOM\r\n- read json file by using charset auto detection (UTF-32BE with BOM) \r\n- read json file using of user's charset (UTF-16LE)\r\n- saving in UTF-32BE and read the result by standard library (not by Spark)\r\n- checking that default charset is UTF-8\r\n- handling wrong (unsupported)

is a backport of #20767 to branch 2.3\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCacheKafkaConsumer in the project `kafka-0-10-sql` is designed to maintain a pool of KafkaConsumers that can be reused. However, it was built with the assumption there will be only one task using trying to read the same Kafka TopicPartition at the same time. Hence, the cache was keyed by the TopicPartition a consumer is supposed to read. And any cases where this assumption may not be true, we have SparkPlan flag to disable the use of a cache. So it was up to the planner to correctly identify when it was not safe to use the cache and set the flag accordingly.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, this is the wrong way to approach the problem. It is HARD for a high-level planner to reason about the low-level execution model, whether there will be multiple tasks in the same query trying to read the same partition. Case in point, 2.3.0 introduced stream-stream joins, and you can build a streaming self-join query on Kafka. It's pretty non-trivial to figure out how this leads to two tasks reading the same partition twice, possibly concurrently. And due to the non-triviality, it is hard to figure this out in the planner and set the flag to avoid the cache / consumer pool. And this can inadvertently lead to ConcurrentModificationException ,or worse, silent reading of incorrect data.\r\n\r\nHere is a better way to design this. The planner shouldnt have to understand these low-level optimizations. Rather the consumer pool should be smart enough avoid concurrent use of a cached consumer. Currently, it tries to do so but incorrectly (the flag inuse is not checked when returning a cached consumer, see [this](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/external/kafka-0-10-sql/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/kafka010/CachedKafkaConsumer.scala#L403)). If there is another request for the same partition as a currently in-use consumer, the pool should automatically return a fresh consumer that should be closed when the task is done. Then the planner does not have to have a flag to avoid reuses.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a step towards that goal. It does the following.\r\n- There are effectively two kinds of consumer that may be generated\r\n  - Cached consumer - this should be returned to the pool at task end\r\n  - Non-cached consumer - this should be closed at task end\r\n- A trait called KafkaConsumer is introduced to hide this difference from the users of the consumer so that the client code does not have to reason about whether to stop and release. They simply called `val consumer = KafkaConsumer.acquire` and then `consumer.release()`.\r\n- If there is request for a consumer that is in-use, then a new consumer is generated.\r\n- If there is a concurrent attempt of the same task, then a new consumer is generated, and the existing cached consumer is marked for close upon release.\r\n- In addition, I renamed the classes because CachedKafkaConsumer is a misnomer given that what it returns may or may not be cached.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not remove the planner flag to avoid reuse to make this patch safe enough for merging in branch-2.3. This can be done later in master-only.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nA new stress test that verifies it is safe to concurrently get consumers for the same partition from the consumer pool.","created_at":"2018-03-16T23:10:33Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T06:09:52Z","closed_at":"2018-03-19T06:09:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2bd4c29928fec1c958ea27b2c795e395b1adbf81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20848/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20848/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20848/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9e440a4e788980e0dc475aa7966c3e56010e7cf7","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-23623-2.3","ref":"SPARK-23623-2.3","sha":"9e440a4e788980e0dc475aa7966c3e56010e7cf7","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe should provide customized canonicalize plan for `InMemoryRelation` and `InMemoryTableScanExec`. Otherwise, we can wrongly treat two different cached plans as same result. It causes wrongly reused exchange then.\r\n\r\nFor a test query like this:\r\n```scala\r\nval cached = spark.createDataset(Seq(TestDataUnion(1, 2, 3), TestDataUnion(4, 5, 6))).cache()\r\nval group1 = cached.groupBy(\"x\").agg(min(col(\"y\")) as \"value\")\r\nval group2 = cached.groupBy(\"x\").agg(min(col(\"z\")) as \"value\")\r\ngroup1.union(group2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCanonicalized plans before:\r\n\r\nFirst exchange:\r\n```\r\nExchange hashpartitioning(none#0, 5)\r\n+- *(1) HashAggregate(keys=[none#0], functions=[partial_min(none#1)], output=[none#0, none#4])\r\n   +- *(1) InMemoryTableScan [none#0, none#1]\r\n         +- InMemoryRelation [x#4253, y#4254, z#4255], true, 10000, StorageLevel(disk, memory, deserialized, 1 replicas)\r\n               +- LocalTableScan [x#4253, y#4254, z#4255]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond exchange:\r\n```\r\nExchange hashpartitioning(none#0, 5)\r\n+- *(3) HashAggregate(keys=[none#0], functions=[partial_min(none#1)], output=[none#0, none#4])\r\n   +- *(3) InMemoryTableScan [none#0, none#1]\r\n         +- InMemoryRelation [x#4253, y#4254, z#4255], true, 10000, StorageLevel(disk, memory, deserialized, 1 replicas)\r\n               +- LocalTableScan [x#4253, y#4254, z#4255]\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can find that they have the canonicalized plans are the same, although we use different columns in two `InMemoryTableScan`s.\r\n\r\nCanonicalized plan after:\r\n\r\nFirst exchange:\r\n```\r\nExchange hashpartitioning(none#0, 5)\r\n+- *(1) HashAggregate(keys=[none#0], functions=[partial_min(none#1)],

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIntroduce `handleInvalid` parameter in `VectorAssembler` that can take in `\"keep\", \"skip\", \"error\"` options. \"error\" throws an error on seeing a row containing a `null`, \"skip\" filters out all such rows, and \"keep\" adds relevant number of NaN. \"keep\" figures out an example to find out what this number of NaN s should be added
