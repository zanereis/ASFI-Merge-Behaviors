all,\r\nLet me introduce myself, I am Sergey Kolychev, a Perl programmer from Portland, OR.\r\nFirst and foremost, thank you for writing such an impressive library!\r\nI really like the design decisions that you guys made!\r\nHere I am proposing a work in progress on an interface to MXNet for Perl programming language.\r\nIt's not yet full parity with Python interface, but I plan to get to full parity in coming weeks. \r\nThis is not yet probably ready to be merged in, I am mostly trying to gather your reaction and thoughts about my work.\r\nMy final view for this piece is to become integral seamless part of mxnet repository, with a setup as simple as Python one and automated creation of self contained Ubuntu deb packages.\r\nI am striving to keep my Perl code as close as possible to the Python code in order to be able to easy incorporate changes made in the Python interface.\r\nI plan to support this project for foreseeable future.\r\nI used Modern Perl techniques for writing this interface in hopes to make it more readable for a person with no prior Perl knowledge.\r\nThank you and please consider having this interface a part of your distribution.\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-13T08:03:38Z","updated_at":"2017-02-14T03:56:30Z","closed_at":"2017-02-14T03:56:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"82f2b0525430be70f0011b1153076a68a55fd3a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/5002/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/5002/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5002/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/7b9ecbcf03f2840e1b4b7c13ef0534f48efe245e","head":{"label":"sergeykolychev:master","ref":"master","sha":"7b9ecbcf03f2840e1b4b7c13ef0534f48efe245e","user":{"login":"sergeykolychev","id":25470168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDcwMTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25470168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev","html_url":"https://github.com/sergeykolychev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":80577235,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MDU3NzIzNQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"sergeykolychev/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sergeykolychev","id":25470168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDcwMTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25470168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev","html_url":"https://github.com/sergeykolychev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sergeykolychev/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

for https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/4893\r\n\r\n@javelinjs  it seems that there are a lot of conflicts among the plugins....\r\n\r\nThis patch is ready for the review. There are four major changes here:\r\n\r\n1. Move the dependency and plugin definition in the root pom.xml: I found that the submodules have a lot of shared dependencies/plugins, so it is not necessary to define in <dependencyManagement>/<pluginManagement> in root pom and reference them in submodules. A more efficient structure would be define them directly in root\r\n\r\n2. Fix the source-jar generated issue...It seems that the latest version of maven-scala-plugin is the cause, and I usually use scala-maven-plugin in my other projects...so I replace maven-scala-plugin with scala-maven-plugin and everything becomes fine\r\n\r\n3. fix some misconfigurations: some projects (spark/example) are configured with <packaging>pom</packaging> which is incorrect....\r\n\r\n4. remove some unused/duplicate plugins\r\n\r\nI published jars to my local repo\r\n\r\nrefer the dependency

Indicate the starting epoch. Usually, if we are resuming from a\r\n            checkpoint saved at a previous training phase at epoch N, then we should specify\r\n            this value as N+1.\r\n```\r\n\r\nYet, for example, if after 3 epochs, we attempt to run with `--resume --begin_epoch 4` we'll receive error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"train_end2end.py\", line 184, in

couple of small fixes:\r\n\r\n1. Allow for floating point bounding box predictions when reading in evaluations. The provided `test_rcnn` function outputs results as floats (perhaps only when evaluating on VOC-like datasets with different image dimensions?)\r\n2. Allow for zero detections of some classes during evaluation. This is handy when evaluating on another dataset in VOC-like format with a subset of the original VOC classes.\r\n\r\nThese fixes have been necessary when training and evaluating on non-VOC datasets

Cross-os/arch/platform build is probably not gonna work.\r\n\r\nContinuing from #4754, code-wise potential next steps are:\r\n1. More testing on different platforms. More auto-detection of tools and safeguard.\r\n2. Also, the currently supported package managers that wheel-build can depend on are apt-get and yum. This can be extended if such need arises.\r\n3. looking into https://github.com/pypa/manylinux and see if it's possible to share builds across linux platforms.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we can:\r\n1.
