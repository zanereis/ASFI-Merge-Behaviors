This allows to disambiguate long fusions (due to taking the hash of the original candidate name), while keeping the size bounded.\r\n\r\nDoes this sound reasonable? It's arguably an interface change, so it's worth double checking this is OK.\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen, @jroesch,

commented as \r\n`Maybe we can simply generalize DetectLinearEquation to accept empty list of loop_var, which returns everything as base. This is well-defined and consistent with original defition.` in https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/863#pullrequestreview-93714075 .\r\nI found that the current implementation returns '1' and the base. I think not returning '1' is more consistent behavior.\r\n\r\nMy PR consists of 3 commits.\r\n1) Add a test to show the current behavior\r\n2) Update the funtion DetectLinearEquation() and the test in 1)\r\n3) Update InjectCopyIntrin(), which uses DetectLinearEquation() so that it works as before.\r\n\r\nI personally think that it is better to handle single point copy in InjectCopyIntrin() as 0-demension array.\r\nThen the immediate value of '1' is not necesary in the function.\r\nBecause I don't know much about the user of InjectCopyIntrin(), I don't change its behavior in this

that there is some enough interest in structured error handling #2279  and we want to have a guideline to resolve the tension of simplicity and structures. This PR attempts to provide a minimum scaffold toward that step.\r\n\r\n- [x] Introduce tvm.error which include specific error class\r\n- [x] Introduce the error handling convention in C++\r\n- [x] Detect and rewrite error messages so that c++ and python stack trace are unified and not redundant.\r\n   - Remove the unnecessary stack-trace back to python(as they will be part of python trace)\r\n   - In python side, print the trace in the most recent call last order.\r\n- [x] Introduce an initial guideline for error handling\r\n\r\n## New Error Messages\r\n\r\nOne thing that I like to highlight is that this PR allows us to simply use\r\n```LOG(FATAL) << \"ErrorType: message``` to throw a specific error out. \r\n\r\nWe also combine the python/c++ stack trace in a reasonable way so that the error message is more human-friendly. The error message itself contains the traceback in C++ function and can be read naturally when combined with the python traceback. We also make it work for callbacks.\r\n\r\nExample C++ code:\r\n```c++\r\n  // src/api_test.cc\r\n  void ErrorTest(int x, int y) {\r\n    CHECK_EQ(x, y) << \"ValueError: expect x and y to be equal.\"\r\n    if (x == 1) {\r\n      LOG(FATAL) << \"InternalError: cannot reach here\";\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above function is registered as PackedFunc into the python frontend,\r\nunder the name ```tvm._api_internal._ErrorTest```.\r\nHere is what will happen if we call the registered function:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  >>> import tvm\r\n  >>> tvm._api_internal._ErrorTest(0, 1)\r\n  Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n    File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n    File \"/path/to/tvm/python/tvm/_ffi/_ctypes/function.py\", line 190, in __call__\r\n      raise get_last_ffi_error()\r\n  ValueError: Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n    [bt] (3) /path/to/tvm/build/libtvm.so(TVMFuncCall+0x48) [0x7fab500b8ca8]\r\n    [bt] (2) /path/to/tvm/build/libtvm.so(+0x1c4126) [0x7fab4f7f5126]\r\n    [bt] (1) /path/to/tvm/build/libtvm.so(+0x1ba2f8) [0x7fab4f7eb2f8]\r\n    [bt] (0) /path/to/tvm/build/libtvm.so(+0x177d12) [0x7fab4f7a8d12]\r\n    File \"/path/to/tvm/src/api/api_test.cc\", line 80\r\n  ValueError: Check failed: x == y (0 vs. 1) : expect x and y to be equal.\r\n  >>>\r\n  >>> tvm._api_internal._ErrorTest(1, 1)\r\n  Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n    File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n    File \"/path/to/tvm/python/tvm/_ffi/_ctypes/function.py\", line 190, in __call__\r\n      raise get_last_ffi_error()\r\n  tvm.error.InternalError: Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n    [bt] (3) /path/to/tvm/build/libtvm.so(TVMFuncCall+0x48) [0x7fab500b8ca8]\r\n    [bt] (2) /path/to/tvm/build/libtvm.so(+0x1c4126) [0x7fab4f7f5126]\r\n    [bt] (1) /path/to/tvm/build/libtvm.so(+0x1ba35c) [0x7fab4f7eb35c]\r\n    [bt] (0) /path/to/tvm/build/libtvm.so(+0x177d12) [0x7fab4f7a8d12]\r\n    File \"/path/to/tvm/src/api/api_test.cc\", line 83\r\n  InternalError: cannot reach here\r\n  TVM hint: You hit an internal error.

#2628. \r\n\r\nThis is a simple modification that does two things:\r\n\r\na) Extends the unit tests in test_autotvm_flop_calculator to randomly sample various datatypes. \r\nb) Modifies compute_flop to stop counting flops from indexing expressions (i.e. `X[a, 4 * b, 5 * c]` does not count as an operation, which is inline with expectations), and unconditionally accumulate flops from mathematical expressions (x * y + z, etc) without checking the datatype (which is what we expect for non-floating point operations).\r\n\r\nThe tests now pass for all cases, which is what we expect.","created_at":"2019-03-11T17:03:22Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T22:00:57Z","closed_at":"2019-03-11T19:55:03Z","merged_at":"2019-03-11T19:55:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"2919a3ee1edc72cd47c14b98af836220c27535d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eqy","id":2239616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2239616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy","html_url":"https://github.com/eqy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

PR adds per-layer scale adjustment to the quantization by adding the per-layer scale as an input to the graph. This is currently mainly intended for calibration purposes, as we would expect the finalized graph to bake in the scales as constants.\r\n\r\nOther pieces: the `passthrough_bound` argument to `QConfig` is used to specify a boundary (if any) to pass through floating point data instead of applying quantization. This can be useful if we wish to tune a single layer/quantized operator's scale at a time.\r\n\r\nTODO: we still need to decide how to port the old interface over\r\nold use case: specify a single global scale at build time, this global scale is frozen as a constant\r\nnew use case 1: leave all per-layer scales free at build time, use this graph for calibration\r\nnew use case 2: specify all per-layer scales at build time, these are then frozen as constants (currently not added
