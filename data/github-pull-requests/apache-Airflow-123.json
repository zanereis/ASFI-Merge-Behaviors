there is no try-catch logic when `pod_mutation_hook` is called in the Kubernetes Executor. So if there is any error/exception during the execution of the `pod_mutation_hook` user created, the whole executor/scheduler will crash. \r\n\r\nSuch error may happen:\r\n- user who authored the `pod_mutation_hook` made an error inside.\r\n- if there is any code inside the `pod_mutation_hook` encounters transient error (e.g. it queries DB and the DB gives a timeout error).\r\n- ... you name it. It can simply go wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make Kubernetes Executor & Scheduler more resilient to such error during PMH execution (current behavior, directly crashing, is a bit scary)\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more

the introduction of `SQLExecuteQueryOperator`, the `RedshiftSQLOperator` was broken. This was due to the parameter `redshift_conn_id` not being used. This PR fixes the issue by introducing the `redshift_conn_id` as a variable to pass the connection id through to the base operator. \r\n\r\nrelated: #25717\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

previous change to fix disappearing log messages turned on propagation for the `airflow.task` logger, and disabled it again after `set_context()` was called, but only if that function returned a special sentinel value.\r\n\r\nFor the \"core\" task log handlers we returned them, but some providers weren't \"correctly\" subclassing and weren't returning this sentinel value.\r\n\r\nThe fix here is to change the logic from disable only on special value to disable by default and maintain propagation on special value; this means that if a handler doesn't return the value from `super()` (or if they don't even subclass the default handler) propagation will still be disabled by default.\r\n\r\nFixes

As mentioned in this issue [https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/27299], There can be a case where we can have DagRunType 'SCHEDULED' with the similar scenario.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCode Changes: Since the `DAG.clear` step doesn't consider `run_id` and works with the `execution_date` (as start and end), it makes sense to get the `dag_run` by filtering on date in case `run_id` is None.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more

so ... here I offer a way to automate enforcement of deprecation removals.\r\n\r\nEnforcement may be triggered by two different means: warning messages and comments.\r\n\r\n## Warning messages\r\n\r\nUse function `warn_provider_deprecation` to warn of feature removal.\r\nSpecify either provider version or min airflow version.  When provider version or min airflow version is greater than the version specified, test will start failing.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\n            warn_provider_deprecation(\r\n                \"This feature will be removed in provider version 6.0\",\r\n                provider_version=(6, 0),\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\n\r\nSometimes we either can't or won't add a warning message to force a code change or removal.  A common scenario is, a helper function is added in core but will not be available in the provider until the min airflow version catches up.  In this case, the helper code must be copied into the provider.  Then, when the min airflow version has caught up, the duplicated code should be removed and just use core code.\r\n\r\nFor this scenario, we add two syntaxes for todo comments:\r\n\r\nFor min airflow version we add comment `# todo: remove-on-min-airflow-version=2.5`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# todo: remove-on-min-airflow-version=2.5\r\n# when removing, import this from airflow.exceptions\r\ndef warn_provider_deprecation(\r\n    message, *, provider_version=None, min_airflow_version=None, category=DeprecationWarning, **kwargs\r\n):\r\n    warnings.warn(message, category=DeprecationWarning, **kwargs)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What it looks like\r\n\r\nGives helpful test failure messages like this:\r\n<img width=\"698\" alt=\"image\"

#27396\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nThe CloudWatch task log handler does not default to local logs (like the documentation says it should) when remote logs are unavailable. This PR fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n### Todo\r\n- [x] Update CloudWatch log handler\r\n- [x] Add/update unit tests\r\n- [x] Manual check (see below for details)\r\n\r\n### Manual check\r\n\r\n#### Procedure\r\n\r\n1. Run a test DAG with [AWS CloudWatch logging configured](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-amazon/stable/logging/cloud-watch-task-handlers.html)\r\n2. Verify that logs are sent to CloudWatch\r\n3. Delete CloudWatch log stream associated with task\r\n4. Create log file locally `echo \"test\" >> {log file path}`\r\n5. Refresh the task log page\r\n\r\n#### Expectations\r\n\r\n* \"Unable to read remote logs from Cloudwatch\" should appear in the log because we deleted the log stream associated with the task.\r\n* \"Reading local file: ...\" should appear in the log to show that the log handler falls back to local logs.\r\n* The contents of the local log file should appear (in this case the contents are \"test\")\r\n\r\n#### Screenshot\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1482\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-11-09 at 7 09 49\"

change makes sure that gevent performs monkey_patching before everything else. Gevent should make sure to patch all the classes that are non-cooperative via gevent into cooperative ones and it should be done as the first thing in the forked gunicorn process.\r\n\r\nUsually GeventWorker does it automatically, however this happens after the configuration of gunicorn gets imported. In our case it means that it happens after airflow setting are loaded - and for example it means that if S3 remote logging is configured, then boto is initialzed before patch_all() and it breaks ssl that is patched by boto itself. Reversing the sequence and making gevent patches the ssl connection first, fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nWe could convert airflow settings to local imports, but this does not guarantee a success because some of the initilization methods might be executed before GeventWorker starts and it is also prone to mistakes (adding top-level import to settings broke it at some point in time and it went unnoticed).\r\n\r\nThis change does it slightly differently - in case of gevent worker, we use a different configuration for gunicorn and make sure that patch_all() is always executed first before any other import and initialization. This should fix the problem and be future-proof.\r\n\r\nFixes: #8212\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

suggest removing the default owner config (introduced 7 years ago in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1318), and defaulting `owner` to `None`.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, the default \"airflow\" owner never reflects a meaningful entity and thus leads to confusion. Defaulting to None means users have to explicitly set an owner, which aligns better with Python's principle \"Explicit is better than implicit\".\r\n\r\nCurrently, you cannot set `owner=None` ([link](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/7297892558e94c8cc869b175e904ca96e0752afe/airflow/models/dag.py#L1234)). A workaround is setting an empty string. This PR also fixes the UI to display nothing when the owner is None:\r\n**After**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6249654/200289607-47450dfa-b73e-4c90-abf0-4ff1c2cbe973.png)\r\n\r\n**Before (with `owner=\"\"`)**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6249654/200291144-93ea3cf6-36f1-468b-ac67-0a56a146ae05.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's likely somebody out there that uses default_owner, so this should be treated as a breaking change.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

could not be passed as parameters to taskflow functions as they could not be serialized. This commit:\r\n\r\n1) changes the xcom serializer so that it now can serialize objects that have attr, dataclass or custom serializer\r\n2) removes the need to for a custom serializer in lineage \r\n3) adds a version check to the serializer/deserializer \r\n4) registers any datasets as either inlets or outlets in the task\r\n5) inlets/outlets that fail to serialize now raise an error instead of being silently ignored\r\n\r\n@ashb @jedcunningham @kaxil \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

happened was that the DatasetDagRunQueue(DDRQ) was updated before the change in the consumer dag.\r\nDuring sync to db, the dataset was marked for deletion from the dag causing the primary key in DDRQ

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/27524 will be merged first!\r\n\r\nI did a thorough review of the kubernetes system KPO backcompat test.\r\n\r\n1. most of the time, no actual backcompat logic was tested and the tests were simply duplicates that can be removed.\r\n2. sometimes actual backcompat was tested and in this case i moved to the main KPO system test module and indicated it is a test of a backcompat feature, and where possible i parametrized.\r\n3. in a some cases, tests that needed to be retained were not actually system tests so i either moved to the unit test module or made it a real system test.\r\n4. in the retained KPO system test module I had to convert it from unittests\r\n\r\nIf you're wondering \"what did you do with all the _backcompat tests\" ... you can review the commit history.

hook was updated to allow non-prefixed extra fields.  So we need to check non-prefixed also.  Best to use the hook's \"get namespace\" method.  But the public one has a problem; it defaults to `default`, so we don't know if it was set to that intentionally.  So we use the \"protected\" method `_get_namespace`, which doesn't return a default.

have a case where the mini scheduler tries to expand a mapped task even when the downstream tasks are not yet done.\r\n\r\nThe mini scheduler extracts a partial subset of a dag and in the process, some upstream tasks are dropped. \r\nIf the task happens to be a mapped task, the expansion will fail since it needs the upstream output to make the expansion.

So `TaskInstanceKey` assumes that the map_index value supplied is try_number and defaults the value of map_index to -1. This causes a bunch of problems downstream when we try and retrieve the `TaskInstance` from the table using the map_index as part of the filter. \r\n\r\nfixes:
