bug in pushing latest image to cache on \"push/schedule\".\r\n\r\nWhen the build is successful and passes all tests vi either\r\n`push' or 'schedule' events, we attempt to rebuild the image\r\nwith latest constraints just pushed and push it as a fresh\r\ncache for Github Registry. This keeps the time to build image\r\nsmall without manually refreshing the cache, it also automatically\r\nchecks if there is a new \"python\" base image available so that\r\nwe can use it in the new cache.\r\n\r\nThere was a bug that the image has not been FORCE_PULLED and\r\nrebuilt in this case - just latest images were used.\r\n\r\nThis had so far no negative effects because due to test\r\ninstability, latest main images pretty much never succeeded in\r\nall tests, so the images in `main` were refreshed manually\r\nperiodically anyway. However for v2-1-test the scope of tests\r\nrun is far smaller now (no Helm tests, no Provider tests)\r\nand they succeed mostly when they should.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it so that the images are built properly and pushed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

get_pandas_df() in HiveServer2Hook by properly adding columns when an empty dataframe is encountered.\r\n\r\nCurrently in hive hooks, when get_pandas_df() is used to create a dataframe, the next step is to add columns to the existing dataframe object.  pandas throws an exception when trying to add columns to an empty dataframe with no columns.  By moving adding columns to the step where the dataframe is created, we can avoid throwing an exception on empty dataframes.\r\n\r\nCurrent behavior using get_pandas_df() to read an empty table:\r\n```\r\nhh = HiveServer2Hook()\r\nsql = \"SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE 1=0\"\r\ndf = hh.get_pandas_df(sql)\r\n\r\n[2021-08-15 21:10:15,282] {{hive.py:449}} INFO - SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE 1=0\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 2, in <module>\r\n  File \"/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/airflow/providers/apache/hive/hooks/hive.py\", line 1073, in get_pandas_df\r\n    df.columns = [c[0] for c in res['header']]\r\n  File \"/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pandas/core/generic.py\", line 5154, in __setattr__\r\n    return object.__setattr__(self, name, value)\r\n  File \"pandas/_libs/properties.pyx\", line 66, in pandas._libs.properties.AxisProperty.__set__\r\n  File \"/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pandas/core/generic.py\", line 564, in _set_axis\r\n    self._mgr.set_axis(axis, labels)\r\n  File \"/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pandas/core/internals/managers.py\", line 227, in set_axis\r\n    f\"Length mismatch: Expected axis has {old_len} elements, new \"\r\nValueError: Length mismatch: Expected axis has 0 elements, new values have 1 elements\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew behavior w/this PR\r\n```\r\nhh = HiveServer2Hook()\r\nsql = \"SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE 1=0\"\r\ndf = hh.get_pandas_df(sql)\r\nlen(df.index)\r\n0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI need help testing this against the `airflow.static_babynames` hive table, if that test is needed.

#13750\r\nrelated: #17315\r\n\r\n`SqlSensor` relies on underlying hooks that are automatically injected (DI) depending on the connection type provided to the `SqlSensor`. However, from time to time (but mainly in `BigqueryHook`) it is needed to pre-configure the \"to-be-injected\" hook because some default params do not fit the current config.\r\n\r\nFor example, if using SqlSensor with Bigquery it by default configures the SQL dialect to \"legacy SQL\", and there is no way to change this through configuration. Instead the SqlSensor has to be extended and some functions overwritten (as mentioned in the #13750).\r\n\r\nTo be able to customise the underlying hook there are 2 approaches to fix this:\r\n* Bring your own hook: instantiate a hook and provide it to the sensor already configured so it just checks that it inherits from `DbApiHook` but doesn't try to instantiate on its own.\r\n* Pass over the params you want SqlSensor to use to instantiate the hook.\r\n\r\nEither one has it's drawbacks:\r\n* Cannot be used if DAG is defined with yaml/json/config-file, since to instantiate a Hook requires \"intelligence\", relying solely in config seems more maintainable in the future.\r\n* The \"tell us what's wrong, we got you covered\" does not follow very well the \"[open but closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle)\" principle.\r\n\r\nKnowing that, and that @uranusjr approves this second approach, and also given the known limitations, this PR makes the SqlSensor pass over the hook_kwargs to the connection hook locator that returns an instantiated hook.","created_at":"2021-08-12T23:53:40Z","updated_at":"2021-11-26T16:02:51Z","closed_at":"2021-11-26T16:02:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc19352151592ddf58874f6e85e502a035a56653","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2853238496,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODUzMjM4NDk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:core-operators","name":"area:core-operators","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":"Operators,

Group id of task group is used to prefix task id, it should\r\nfollow the same limitation that task_id has, plus it should not\r\nhave '.'.

only use `pandas` in `DbApiHook.get_pandas_df`. Not all users use it, plus\r\nwhile `pandas` now supports many pre-compiled packages it still can take forever where\r\nit needs to be compiled.\r\n\r\nSo for first-time users this can be a turn off. If pandas is already installed this\r\nwill work fine, but if not users have an option to run `pip install apache-airflow[pandas]`\n\nRelated #12500\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

that Cassandra was the main reason why a lot of memory\r\nwas used during our integration tests. This has been overlooked\r\nbefore but seems that cassandra will always take as much as 25%\r\nof available memory by default and it meant for the GitHub public\r\nrunners it was ~2 GB. Also for the self-hosted runners, even if\r\nthey had a lot of memory, cassandra could eat up big chunk of the\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nWith the settings added in PR Cassandra will take ~750 MB of memory\r\ntotal.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

I commit this change:  \r\n  * When checking the `airflow` features, I found that the dag `run_id` is generated using the UTC time, but actually, it is not convenient for us to use the UTC time because we are using local time. \r\n  * For example, I am in Beijing now, I ran a DAG at 19:01, the default `run_id` is `manual__2021-09-08T11:01:02.022226+08:00`, but after a few hours, I want to find this run, I have to parse the local time to UTC time to get the specific dag_run. If the `run_id` is generated using local time, the `run_id` will be  `manual__2021-09-08T19:01:02.022226+08:00`,  I can easily find this dag_run.\r\n\r\nHow do I change:\r\n  * Added a config `localize_dag_run_id` in the `core` config and the default value is False. It takes no effect if the user doesn't care about the dag run_id format. If the users who just like me want to use the local time to generate the `run_id`, they can set it to `True`\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7628879/128689674-2e1ed279-c5fc-4ecb-be9a-b1704bb07073.png)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-09T10:02:58Z","updated_at":"2021-10-18T02:39:24Z","closed_at":"2021-10-18T02:19:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f9962a0d8f7881b5310dd36071f79b05933f59f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_tea

deprecation notice for `SubDagOperator`\r\ncloses: #12292\r\nThe [mailing list discussion](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ra52746f9c8274469d343b5f0251199de776e75ab75ded6830886fb6a%40%3Cdev.airflow.apache.org%3E) was before Airflow 2 was released. I think we have a good adoption of TasksGroup however \r\nI see users that are on Airflow 2 who still write new DAGs with `SubDagOperator` (Not sure why)\r\n\r\nWe know the general direction is to replace `SubDagOperator` with TasksGroup so I think we should place a deprecation notice.\r\n\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

are several ways people might get the quick-start\r\ndocker-compose running messed up (especially on linux):\r\n\r\n1) they do not run initialization steps and run docker-compose-up\r\n2) they do not run docker-compose-init first\r\n\r\nAlso on MacOS/Windows default memory/disk settings are not\r\nenough to run Airflow via docker-compose and people are reporting\r\n\"Airflow not working\" where they simply do not allocate enough\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nFinally the docker compose does not support all versions of airflow\r\nand various problems might occur when you use this\r\ndocker compose with old version of airflow.\r\n\r\nThis change adds the following improvements:\r\n\r\n* automated check of minimum version of airflow supported\r\n* mkdir -p in the directories creation in instructions\r\n* automated checking if AIRFLOW_UID has been set (and printing\r\n  error and instruction link in case it is not)\r\n* prints warning about too-low memory, cpu, disk allocation\r\n  and instruction link where to read about it\r\n* automated fixing of ownership of the directories created in\r\n  case they were not created initially and ended up owned by\r\n  root user\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR changes the existing behavior of [\"extra links\" added to operators](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/docs/apache-airflow/howto/define_extra_link.rst) such that any _relative_ links open in place rather than in a new window/tab.  This is consistent with the way other links/buttons in Airflow work today.  Any absolute links will continue to open in a new window/tab as they do today.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this change, a \"relative\" link is defined as any link url that does not satisfy the following regular expression: `^(?:[a-z]+:)?//`.  See [this stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19709846) for more in depth discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note: As a first time contributor, I've followed the contributing documentation as much as possible.  I could not find any existing tests to update for the www js code, so given the simplicity of this change, I did not add any tests, however, I did run all WWW tests as well as static analysis.  Please let me know if i missed something or this is otherwise unacceptable.  Looking forward to feedback!_\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-06T20:55:01Z","updated_at":"2021-08-16T15:55:12Z","closed_at":"2021-08-16T15:31:47Z","merged_at":"2021-08-16T15:31:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"84de7c53c2ebabef98e0916b13b239a8e4842091","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay to merge","color":"64e05c","default":false,"description":"It's ok to merge this PR as it does not require more tests"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

we build production image during test in main, we install\r\nproviders from current sources, to make sure that all the tests\r\nincluding Helm Chart/Kubernetes tests are using latest sources for\r\nproviders.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we build the prod image during v* branches, we\r\nwant to build the production image using latest released providers\r\ninstead, because this will be the way it will be built shortly when\r\nwe release it. We do not run providers test not helm chart tests in\r\nthis branch so it is more important to build the image in the way it\r\nwill be built for releases - we run verification then and install\r\ndependencies in the very same way it will be done during release.\r\n\r\nDepends on #17486 \r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
