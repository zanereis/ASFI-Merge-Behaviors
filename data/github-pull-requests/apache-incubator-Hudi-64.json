What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nReducing the default retry timer to 250 ms for Lock configurations. If two writers tries to acquire lock at the same time, one of them will go ahead and acquire the lock. While the other retries after some time. Prior to this patch, the timer was set to 5 secs. Sometimes writer1 goes ahead and fully completes the entire transaction and hence writer2 will not have a chance to conflict only. my hunch as to why this has surfaced in recent times is that, we added lock even during init table in SparkRDDWriteClient. So, no two transactions will every conflict at this juncture. They might conflict only if they contend little later in the lifecycle. \r\n\r\nAlso, fixed TestHoodieClientMultiWriter. testHoodieClientBasicMultiWriter to assert for proper conflicts. \r\n\r\n##

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nTransaction manager has begin and end transactions as synchronized methods. Based on the lock provider implementaion, this can lead to deadlock situation when the underlying lock() calls are blocking or with a long timeout. Here is a sample flow: \r\n\r\nClient 1: beginTransaction() => txn manager instance lock acquired,  lock() went through, instance lock released\r\nClient 2: beginTransaction() => txn manager instance lock acquired, lock() is blocking \r\nCilent 1: endTransaction() => Waiting to lock the txn manager instance to enter the synchronized method\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nFixing transaction manager begin and end transactions to not get to deadlock and to not assume anything on the lock provider implementation.\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests for single and multi writer transactions.\r\n\r\nNote: This PR is stacked on top of https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4259 to make use of the InProcessLockProvider implementation for the test\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Today, base files have bloom filter at their footers and index lookups\r\n  have to load the base file to perform any bloom lookups. Though we have\r\n  interval tree based file purging, we still end up in significant amount\r\n  of base file read for the bloom filter for the end index lookups for the\r\n  keys. This index lookup operation can be made more performant by having\r\n  all the bloom filters in a new metadata partition and doing pointed\r\n  lookups based on keys.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nRFC-37 https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3989 Implementation\r\n\r\n- Write path will now additionally persist bloom filters from all the newly added\r\n   base files from the inflight commit to the metadata table bloom index, and\r\n   column range metadata to the metadata table column stats index. \r\n\r\n- Read path during tagLocation() lookupIndex() will look at the metadata table\r\n  indices instead of base files. Final verification of the incoming keys will continue\r\n  to happen with the respective base files. \r\n\r\n## Tests \r\n\r\nTotal Index lookup time taken:\r\nTable: COW\r\nOperation: Upsert\r\nSpark executors, cores: 25, 4\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3233255/151424438-c3eccfaf-19ef-4b40-bd8e-6340e5a24dec.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n1. add modules and refactor existing modules to make spark2 and spark3 work, the main change is to move classes from hudi-spark module to hudi-spark-common module to make both hudi-spark2, hudi-spark3 and hudi-spark3.1.x modules would make use of the classes, also add hudi-spark3-common and hudi-spark2-common modules to make spark3.1.x and spark 3.2.0 reuse most of code, hudi-spark2-common has no class and is just a placeholder to make package command work in hudi-spark-bundle & hudi-spark module.\r\n2. change spark-datasource/hudi-spark `hudi` format to hudi_v1 and add hudi format in hudi-spark2, hudi-spark3 and hudi-spark3.1.x module.\r\n3. Introduce HoodieCatalog to manage hudi tables and make write/read workable with spark2&spark3 workable, currently the write and read path both fallback to V1 path, but introduce V2 Table to pave the way for pure V2 code path, and accordingly handle V2 command in `HoodieSpark3Analysis` class since some commands changed in V2.\r\n4. spark 3.1.x and spark 2.4.x would still use the exist spark sql to write and read data and still use V1 format, but from spark3.2.0, we move to V2 format, users need config 'org.apache.spark.sql.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.hudi.catalog.HoodieCatalog'\r\n5. add flag to exist tests on spark 3.2.0 with HoodieCatalog.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n(or)\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end.*\r\n  - *Added HoodieClientWriteTest to verify the change.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job locally.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- HoodieIncremental source is used to read incrementally from a hudi table. When a deltastreamer is started to consume from source table and no checkpoint is provided, by setting. \"hoodie.deltastreamer.source.hoodieincr.read_latest_on_missing_ckpt\", we can enforce reading from latest commit. but htis means that incremental consumption will consume just the records ingested in the latest commit and not other records. \r\n\r\nBut what if users wants to consume all data from source table. So, with this, user has two options. \r\nOption1: Do one time bulk load of snapshot read from source table and ingest to sink table and then start incremental read\r\nOption2: we can go with the fix in this patch. \r\n\r\nSo, introducing a new config named `hoodie.deltastreamer.source.hoodieincr.missing.checkpoint.strategy` which can accept two values, READ_LATEST and READ_EVERYTHING_UNTIL_LATEST. READ_LATEST will fallback to same behavior when users sets \"hoodie.deltastreamer.source.hoodieincr.read_latest_on_missing_ckpt\". But when a user sets \"READ_EVERYTHING_UNTIL_LATEST\", entire dataset is consumed on first batch when checkpoint is missing. \r\nAlso, have deprecated the old config \"hoodie.deltastreamer.source.hoodieincr.read_latest_on_missing_ckpt\".\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\nAdded TestHoodieIncrSource to test the added functionality. \r\n\r\n##

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThere could be a potential deadlock with the way methods in Transaction Manager is synchronized. Prior to this patch, all begin and end transaction methods were synchronized. So, consider the following scenario.\r\nDeltastreaamer with async table service. Lets call deltastreamer as writer1 and async table service as writer2 (both will be sharing the same write client). \r\nwriter1 acquires the lock and proceeds on to do some work.\r\nwriter2 tries to begin transactions now. since lock is not available, it will be put to wait, but is within synchronized block.\r\nwriter1 finishes the work and tries to end the transaction, but since writer2 is waiting within synchronized block, writer1 can't end the transaction. \r\nThis patch fixes the issue by de-coupling the begin and end transaction methods for synchronization. \r\n\r\n## Brief change

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nRecently, CI runs constantly fail and the CI logs reveal that the failure is due to running hdfs commands, hitting connection refused.  The root cause is that when running hdfs command, the namenode:8020 required is not yet ready for connection.\r\n\r\nThe reason it fails recently is that somehow the order of IT tests running in CI is perturbed because of code changes and the IT test using hdfs command runs first now.  Before, other tests run first, giving time for the namenode to be up, ensuring success hdfs command execution later on.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to add a health check by waiting until namenode:8020 is available for connection before starting any IT tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Adds a health check method by using netcat command to check if the port Is open, in `ITTestBase`\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n \r\nThis pull request fixes the CI failures and is verified by running CI tests.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n- HoodieFileIndex parses partition columns from schema. But it had a bug where nested fields were not considered. this patch is fixing the same. \r\n- If the table is partitioned on column `a.b.c.` which is struct in nature , loading hoodie table through spark was giving \r\n`Cannot find column: 'a.b.c' in the schema` \r\nRun Command : `spark.read.format(\"hudi\").load(\"<table_path>\").show()` \r\n This PR fixes above error by traversing schema struct recursively.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n(or)\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end.*\r\n  - *Added HoodieClientWriteTest to verify the change.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job locally.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title &

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR adds Trino setup in the Docker Demo so users can try querying Hudi table synced to Hive using Trino query engine.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Adds docker build config for `base_java11` for Trino related containers since Trino server can be only executed with Java 11 and above\r\n  - Adds docker build config for `trinobase` (base image for Trino container), `trinocoordinator` (for Trino Coordinator container), and `trinoworker` (for Trino Worker container)\r\n  - Adjusts sparkadhoc docker config to be able to run Trino CLI\r\n  - Adds config in `docker/compose/docker-compose_hadoop284_hive233_spark244.yml` for Trino setup\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThe new images can be built with docker under `$HUDI_DIR/docker/hoodie/hadoop`using the commands below.  New images are uploaded to docker hub.\r\n```\r\ndocker build sparkadhoc -t apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-hive_2.3.3-sparkadhoc_2.4.4\r\ndocker build base_java11 -t
