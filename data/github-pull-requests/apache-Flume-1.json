<code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> to further address CVE-2020-8908 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/4011\">#4011</a>) and CVE-2023-2976 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/2575\">#2575</a>). (feb83a1c8f)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While CVE-2020-8908 was officially closed when we deprecated <code>Files.createTempDir</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v30.0\">Guava 30.0</a>, we've heard from users that even recent versions of Guava have been listed as vulnerable in <em>other</em> databases of security vulnerabilities. In response, we've reimplemented the method (and the very rarely used <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> class, which had a similar issue) to eliminate the insecure behavior entirely. This change could technically affect users in a number of different ways (discussed under &quot;Incompatible changes&quot; below), but in practice, the only problem users are likely to encounter is with Windows. If you are using those APIs under Windows, you should skip 32.0.0 and go straight to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a> which fixes the problem. (Unfortunately, we didn't think of the Windows problem until after the release. And while we <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava#important-warnings\">warn that <code>common.io</code> in particular may not work under Windows</a>, we didn't intend to regress support.) Sorry for the trouble.</p>\n<h4>Incompatible changes</h4>\n<p>Although this release bumps Guava's major version number, it makes <strong>no binary-incompatible changes to the <code>guava</code> artifact</strong>.</p>\n<p>One change could cause issues for Widows users, and a few other changes could cause issues for users in more usual situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The new implementations of <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6535\">throw an exception under Windows</a>.</strong> This is fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a>. Sorry for the trouble.</li>\n<li>This release makes a binary-incompatible change to a <code>@Beta</code> API in the <strong>separate artifact</strong> <code>guava-testlib</code>. Specifically, we changed the return type of <code>TestingExecutors.sameThreadScheduledExecutor</code> to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. The old return type was a package-private class, which caused the Kotlin compiler to produce warnings. (dafaa3e435)</li>\n<li>This release <em>adds</em> two methods to the Android flavor of Guava: <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. Those methods do not work under an Android VM; we added them only to help our tests of the Android flavor (since we also run those tests under a JRE). Android VMs tolerate such methods as long as the app does not call them or perform reflection on them, and builds tolerate them because of our new Proguard configurations (discussed below). Thus, we expect no impact to most users. However, we could imagine build problems for users who have set up their own build system for the Android flavor of Guava. Please report any problems so that we can judge how safely we might be able to add other methods to the Android flavor in the future, such as APIs that use Java 8 classes like <code>Stream</code>.

href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/guava-announce/zHZTFg7YF3o/rQNnwdHeEwAJ\">Guava types can no longer be sent over GWT-RPC.</a> To <em>temporarily</em> reenable support, set the <code>guava.gwt.emergency_reenable_rpc</code> system property to <code>true</code>. (5214a10b1e)\n<ul>\n<li>This is the only breaking change in this release, and it affects only users of the <code>guava-gwt</code> artifact, not people who use only the <code>guava</code> artifact. This release contains no changes that break <em>binary compatibility</em> for any users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>API documentation for Guava classes is now easier to reach. For example, for <code>ImmutableList</code>, visit <a href=\"https://guava.dev/ImmutableList\">guava.dev/ImmutableList</a>. Also, more easily access the index at <a href=\"https://guava.dev/api\">guava.dev/api</a>.</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Annotated <code>FluentIterable.from(FluentIterable)</code> with <code>@DoNotCall</code>. (b1c77b7df3)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made <code>ceiling</code>, <code>floor</code>, <code>headSet(E, boolean)</code>, and <code>tailSet(E, boolean)</code> methods available in the GWT-emulated <code>ImmutableSortedSet</code>. (7e0fe90ca8, 5f2fbf27b2)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Made it possible to set a stable incident edge order by calling the newly added method <code>[Value]Graph.Builder.incidentEdgeOrder(ElementOrder.stable())</code>. (70164025a8)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Added <code>incidentEdgeOrder()</code> to the <code>[Value]Graph</code> interfaces. (cde576ec00)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>Duration</code>-based <code>default</code> methods to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. (931e83f969)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>immediateVoidFuture</code>. (9f3bae5853)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Removed <code>@Beta</code> from <code>Service</code> and related classes. (dc46627fea)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the 1-arg overload of <code>ServiceManager.addListener</code>. (86e3620125)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed the return type of <code>ServiceManager.servicesByState()</code> to <code>ImmutableSetMultimap</code> (but also retained a method with the old signature for binary compatibility). (31999ae6f5)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Made it safe to load the <code>AbstractFuture</code> class from a <code>ForkJoinPool</code> thread under a security manager.

runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.16.1</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve performance characteristics of UnknownFieldSet parsing (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9371\">#9371</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.16.0</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix compiler warnings issue found in conformance_test_runner <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8189\">#8189</a> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8190\">#8190</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix MinGW-w64 build issues.

PR is to take advantage of Kafka Transactions (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-98+-+Exactly+Once+Delivery+and+Transactional+Messaging) as part of KafkaSink and KafkaChannel, which allows cleaner rollback, Exactly Once Semantics (EOS) but also potentially performance improvements (see https://redpanda.com/blog/fast-transactions for how this works).\r\n\r\nI have a docs change alongside this, but essentially this is all controlled by setting the producer `transactional.id` and all of the Kafka code works on whether this has been set or not.\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests to

check.\r\n![企业微信截图_16520961102699](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37236056/168409727-597bfebc-3ca0-4321-9210-54e1ff16c540.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## reasons\r\nKafka changed `ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm` default value to `https` since [kafka client 2.0+](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade_200_notable) , so kafka client always check FQDN.\r\n\r\n> The default value for ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm was changed to https, which performs hostname verification (man-in-the-middle attacks are possible otherwise). Set ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm to an empty string to restore the previous behaviour.\r\n\r\nIt needs to set `ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm` to an empty string to prevent FQDN check. But according to [FLUME-3391](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLUME-3391?jql=text%20~%20%22ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm%22), one cannot do this because flume has an empty value config validation.\r\n\r\nBesides, the default hostname verification shoud not be activated accroding to [flume document](https://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#kafka-source).\r\n\r\n> Note: By default the property ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm is not defined, so hostname verification is not performed. In order to enable hostname verification, set the following properties.\r\n\r\n## how to fix\r\nwe need to add the following properties instead of straightforwardly setting ``ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm`` to an empty string.\r\n``a1.sources.source1.kafka.consumer.ssl.disableTLSHostnameVerification = true``\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-31T06:24:33Z","updated_at":"2022-09-18T06:01:54Z","closed_at":"2022-09-17T20:14:26Z","merged_at":"2022-09-17T20:14:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"3cfd79168cc15cf82c32169c0aaee8d02da9e934","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/382/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/382/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/382/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/statuses/0fb795fc9f97fee8ec7741a074f21a205f917c55","head":{"label":"geniusjoe:FLUME-3315","ref":"FLUME-3315","sha":"0fb795fc9f97fee8ec7741a074f21a205f917c55","user":{"login":"geniusjoe","id":37236056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjM2MDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37236056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe","html_url":"https://github.com/geniusjoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":491825706,"node_id":"R_kgDOHVCqKg","name":"flume","full_name":"geniusjoe/flume","private":false,"owner":{"login":"geniusjoe","id":37236056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjM2MDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37236056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe","html_url":"https://github.com/geniusjoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/geniusjoe/flume","description":"Mirror

issue links\r\n[FLUME-3391](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLUME-3391?jql=text%20~%20%22ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm%22) (duplicated)\r\n\r\n[FLUME-3315](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLUME-3315?jql=text%20~%20%22ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm%22)\r\n\r\n## steps to reproduce\r\n- using kafka as source\r\n- set transmit protocol like `a1.sources.kafka_source.kafka.consumer.security.protocol=SASL_SSL` to use ssl security layer\r\n- set bootstrap servers like `a1.sources.kafka_source.kafka.bootstrap.servers=172.16.0.1:9092` to use direct `ip:port` format instead of domain name \r\n\r\nFirst starts flume program, the output shows that `ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm` enable `https` varification feature.\r\n\r\n![企业微信截图_16520962792042](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37236056/168409652-372cea47-3402-4a28-b853-802faab4a59b.png)\r\n\r\nThen flume will fail when handshakes with kafka broker due to [FQDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) check.\r\n![企业微信截图_16520961102699](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37236056/168409727-597bfebc-3ca0-4321-9210-54e1ff16c540.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## reasons\r\nKafka changed `ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm` default value to `https` since [kafka client 2.0+](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade_200_notable) , so kafka client always check FQDN.\r\n\r\n> The default value for ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm was changed to https, which performs hostname verification (man-in-the-middle attacks are possible otherwise). Set ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm to an empty string to restore the previous behaviour.\r\n\r\nIt needs to set `ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm` to an empty string to prevent FQDN check. But according to [FLUME-3391](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLUME-3391?jql=text%20~%20%22ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm%22), one cannot do this because flume has an empty value config validation.\r\n\r\nBesides, the default hostname verification shoud not be activated accroding to [flume document](https://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#kafka-source).\r\n\r\n> Note: By default the property ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm is not defined, so hostname verification is not performed. In order to enable hostname verification, set the following properties.\r\n\r\n## how to fix\r\nTry to check if user set `ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm` value. If not, add empty string as its value.\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-14T04:20:36Z","updated_at":"2022-08-30T13:01:43Z","closed_at":"2022-08-30T12:53:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7ea94ac36c1d12ce8e64a9a3aaf5e4bc666cfae1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/371/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/371/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/371/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/statuses/6c90afc5273db50c7dbb8117483fad6bef61ac20","head":{"label":"geniusjoe:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"6c90afc5273db50c7dbb8117483fad6bef61ac20","user":{"login":"geniusjoe","id":37236056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjM2MDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37236056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe","html_url":"https://github.com/geniusjoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":491825706,"node_id":"R_kgDOHVCqKg","name":"flume","full_name":"geniusjoe/flume","private":false,"owner":{"login":"geniusjoe","id":37236056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjM2MDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37236056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe","html_url":"https://github.com/geniusjoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/geniusjoe/flume","description":"Mirror

PR includes the following changes: \r\n\r\n1. Adds support for configuration via a URI. The currently supported protocols are HTTTP/S, file, and classpath. File and HTTP support reloading. It supports the use of Basic Authentication out of the box but a custom Authentication class can be provided.\r\n2. Supports multiple configuration files. The files are merged into one configuration. This allows a base configuration and different files for prod or dev, etc.\r\n3. Uses Apache Commons Text's StringSubstitutor to allow variable replacement. So values can include ${env:PORT}, ${sys:port}, or just ${PORT} depending on the need. ${PORT} would reference a property in one of the properties files (presumably an override file). \r\n\r\nWhen building all the existing tests passed except for the TestSpooldirSource in the integration tests. However, that test failed for me before I made any changes. I will look into that failure

issue:\r\nWhen file is renamed or rotated,  just as it is in log4j or other similar log system, currently Flume taildirSource will treat it as a new file then all contents will be collected again. It will cause data duplicated, which has been described in [FLUME-3233](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLUME-3233)、 [FLUME-3219](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLUME-3219)、[FLUME-3094](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLUME-3094)、[FLUME-3216](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLUME-3216) and [FLUME-2777](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLUME-2777).\r\nThe general solution is only monitor original  *.log and NOT monitor the renamed *.log.xxx. But for below two reasons, we must monitor both *.log and  renamed *.log.xxx:\r\n1、 Sometimes log system uses async writting. Contents may be flushed to disk after file is renamed. If we do not monitor renamed *.log.xxx, the content will only be sent out when Flume close inactive file. Though Flume will send it out finally, but it will cause sending delay and curreny the interval is decided by _idleTimeout_, default 120 seconds. In many cases it is unacceptable.\r\n2、Sometimes both service and Flume are shutdown. Service is restarted firstly then it writes something to *.log and rename it as *.log.xxx before Flume is restarted successfully. If we do not monitor renamed *.log.xxx, the data will get lost certernly.\r\n\r\nThe solution:\r\nThe PR add a new _inodeOnly_ paramater to reslove data duplication  problem when monitoring both *.log and *.log.xx. And it will bring taildirSource ability of supporting file rename/rotation. By default,  _inodeOnly_  is false and Flume just works same with now. When _inodeOnly_ in config is set as true, Flume only use inode to identify file then taildirSource will support file rename/rotation. And the above 2 problems will be solved

provides support for deduplication of events using the\r\n`_id` field when inserting documents using the bulk insert facility.\r\n\r\nWhen using the UUID interceptor with `headerName = _id` for this\r\npurpose, the logstash serializer will rename this as `@fields._id`,\r\nwhich is stored as though it were any other field.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable deduplication of events in the ElasticSearch sink, we\r\nneed to ensure the header containing the document ID is sent as `_id`,\r\nno matter what its original name is.\r\n\r\nThe dynamic serializer probably does not have the same limitation,
