`LegacyKafkaConsumer` employs a simple caching scheme when fetching offset requests. [`ConsumerCoordinator.fetchCommittedOffsets()`](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/internals/ConsumerCoordinator.java#L921-L961) reuses the same request across multiple attempts, as long as the set of partitions remain the same for each successive attempt. This is critical for cases where the user invokes `Consumer.poll(0)` because the first few fetch offsets attempts will not have enough time to complete.\r\n\r\nThe `AsyncKafkaConsumer` has a similar approach, but a logic bug prevented the request from being reused across multiple attempts since it removed the cached request immediately when it completed.\r\n\r\nThis change allows us to keep the offset fetch request in the inflight list when it succeeds. This allows the _next_ offset fetch attempt to find the _previous_ attempt in the inflight list and reuse its result.\r\n\r\nSome existing tests that were disabled for `CONSUMER` are now enabled by this change. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

request handling for the updated versions of the KRaft RPCs (Fetch, FetchSnapshot, Vote, BeginQuorumEpoch and EndQuorumEpoch). This doesn't add support for KRaft replicas to send the new version of the KRaft RPCs. That will be implemented in KAFKA-16529.\r\n\r\nAll of the RPCs responses were extended to include the leader's endpoint for the listener of the channel used in the request. EpochState was extended to include the leader's endpoint information but only the FollowerState and LeaderState know the leader id and its endpoint(s).\r\n\r\nFor the Fetch request, the replica directory id was added. The leader now tracks the follower's log end offset using both the replica id and replica directory id.\r\n\r\nFor the FetchSnapshot request, the replica directory id was added. This is not used by the KRaft leader and it is there for consistency with Fetch and for help debugging.\r\n\r\nFor the Vote request, the replica key for both the voter (destination) and the candidate (source) were added. The voter key is checked for consistency. The candidate key is persisted when the vote is granted.\r\n\r\nFor the BeginQuorumEpoch request, all of the leader's endpoints are included. This is needed so that the voters can return the leader's endpoint for all of the supported listeners.\r\n\r\nFor the EndQuorumEpoch request, all of the leader's endpoints are included. This is needed so that the voters can return the leader's endpoint for all of the supported listeners. The successor list has been extended to include the directory id. Receiving voters can use the entire replica key when searching their position in the successor list.\r\n\r\nUpdated the existing test in KafkaRaftClientTest and KafkaRaftClientSnapshotTest to execute using both the old version and new version of the RPCs.","created_at":"2024-06-06T21:26:25Z","updated_at":"2024-08-07T04:13:01Z","closed_at":"2024-06-25T20:45:15Z","merged_at":"2024-06-25T20:45:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"adee6f0cc11c37edaf7b47c1f77457d66e80ebe4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6787634831,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABlJMWjw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-853","name":"KIP-853","color":"D00CA6","default":false,"description":"KRaft

patch is the continuation of https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/15964. It introduces the records coalescing to the CoordinatorRuntime. It also introduces a new configuration `group.coordinator.append.linger.ms` which allows administrators to chose the linger time or disable it with zero. The new configuration defaults to 10ms.\r\n\r\nI am still working on the tests so I keep the PR as a draft for now. However, all the existing tests that uses no linger are all passing.

modification to `CommonClientConfigs` and `StreamsConfig` which are both public interfaces. To make sure everything is backward compatible, I deprecated the previous constants and added the ones conforming to the naming convention bellow it. I also added a Javadoc for each one of them. Is this good? \r\n\r\nIn the public interfaces, the renaming looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```Java\r\n/**  \r\n * @deprecated Use {@link #NEW_VARIABLE_DEFAULT} instead.  \r\n */\r\n@Deprecated  \r\npublic static final String DEFAULT_OLD_VARIABLE = \"default.api.timeout.ms\";  \r\npublic static final String NEW_VARIABLE_DEFAULT = \"default.api.timeout.ms\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer

PR adds skeleton code for Share Fetch and Acknowledge RPCs. The changes include:\r\n1. Defining RPCs in KafkaApis.scala\r\n2. Added new SharePartitionManager class which handles the RPCs handling\r\n3. Added SharePartition class which manages in-memory record states and for fetched data.\r\n\r\n#### Note: The new classes are in `core` module itself as has dependency on core classes like `ReplicaManager` etc. hence cannot move the classes in `server` module.\r\n\r\nSubsequent PRs will follow implementation and tests cases for the functionality.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

 Brief Introduction\r\nThis PR is sub PR from https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/16097.\r\nThat Pr we add spotless plugin to build.gradle.\r\nIn order not to modify large-scale code, we plan apply it step by step in module. \r\nThe first is 'transaction-coordinator' 'server-common'.\r\nModule  'transaction-coordinator' meets the requirements(only have 2 Java class) so apply it directly.\r\nThis PR update 'server-common' module code review import order.\r\nWe will apply `spotless` to all module in future\r\n\r\n## How to test:\r\nWe can run `./gradlew spotlessCheck`  check for code that does not meet requirements. \r\nIf we get report that error , we can run `./gradlew spotlessApply` to review my code.\r\nIn this PR, all change(exclude `build.gradle`) ` by `spotlessApply`

to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16814\r\n\r\nWhen starting up kafka logManager, we'll check stray replicas to avoid some corner cases. But this check might cause broker unable to startup if `partition.metadata` is missing because when startup kafka, we load log from file, and the topicId of the log is coming from `partition.metadata` file. So, if `partition.metadata` is missing, the topicId will be None, and the `LogManager#isStrayKraftReplica` will fail with no topicID error.\r\n\r\nThe `partition.metadata` missing could be some storage failure, or another possible path is unclean shutdown after topic is created in the replica, but before data is flushed into `partition.metadata` file. This is possible because we do the flush in async way

pull request changes the method to calculate the `punctuate-ratio` metric. The current implementation calculates the metric after the last record of the poll loop. After a puntuate, the value is close to 1, but there is little chance that metric is sampled at this time.  So its value is almost always 0.   \r\n\r\nThe updated implementation calculates the metric value over the window of last 30 seconds. \r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix. Unit and/or integration\r\ntests are expected for any behaviour change and\r\nsystem tests should be considered for larger changes.*\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n-
