If one of them returns null after it is called, then the corresponding default value will be used to bound the calculated interval.\r\n3) The custom interval values in the config are now allowed to equal the default values. For example, if the default min interval is 7200 then in the config file \"0\", \"default\" and \"7200\" are all valid values for the custom min interval, and they all have the same result.\r\n4) The config file template is changed to account for these

Fetcher signals QueueFeeder (via FetchItemQueues) to stop queuing and waits 1.5 seconds for this to happen\r\n- QueueFeeder (if still alive) discards remaining items with QueuingStatus \"HIT_BY_TIMEOUT\"\r\n- add number of items skipped by QueueFeeder to \"FetcherStatus\" counters\r\n- mark variables defined in FetchItemQueues but accessed from QueueFeeder thread as \"volatile\"\r\n- minor code cleanups\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solution was tested the following way:\r\n- the local Apache httpd was configured to respond with \"HTTP 429 Too many requests\" on a specific path\r\n- a seed list containing URLs with mostly URLs on this path on localhost was created and converted into a segment using the \"freegen\" tool\r\n- Fetcher was run with a single fetcher thread, a short queue and a high timeout divisor (= short timeout):\r\n  ```\r\n  nutch fetch -Dfetcher.queue.depth.multiplier=2 -Dfetcher.threads.timeout.divisor=20 path/to/segment -threads 1\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nBecause most of the fetches failed with HTTP status code 429, the queue was throttled using the configured exponential backoff. When the delay was larger then the timeout, Fetcher stopped the QueueFeeder and finished. Below the log snippets from the hadoop.log.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-10-24 14:20:10,021 INFO o.a.n.f.Fetcher [main] Fetcher: starting\r\n...\r\n2024-10-24 14:20:10,934 INFO o.a.n.f.Fetcher [LocalJobRunner

NUTCH-3067:\r\n\r\n1. do not keep every stateful queue: drop queues which have a low exception count after a configurable amount of time. If a second URL from the same host/domain/IP is fetched after a considerably long time span (eg. 30 minutes), the effect on performance and politeness should be negligible.\r\n\r\n   This is configured by `fetcher.exceptions.per.queue.clear.after` (default 30 minutes): if this time has elapsed after the next fetch time in the queue, that is in addition to any delay defined by the exponential backoff, empty queues are dropped.\r\n\r\n2. reviewed and improved the handling of the exponential backoff in [FetchQueues.checkExceptionThreshold](https://nutch.apache.org/documentation/javadoc/api/org/apache/nutch/fetcher/FetchItemQueues.html#checkExceptionThreshold(java.lang.String,int,long)): if the delayed next fetch would happen after the fetcher timelimit (if configured), the queue is purged and blocked because no fetch item will be fetched from the queue anyway.\r\n\r\n3. reduce the memory footprint of a single FetchQueue - important if there are many of them.\r\n\r\nIn addition, logging and documentation has been improved. While testing this PR on a production crawl, a NUTCH-3072 has been detected.

in Progress**\r\n\r\nThis PR begins to address [NUTCH-3064](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-3064) by performing the upgrade of the com.maxmind.geoip2:geoip2 dependency to v4.2.0. It has not been tested in distributed Nutch deployment as of yet. I say this because although no additional dependencies have been added I will wish to test out a full deployment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the proposed upgrade I performed some refactoring which I considered to be improvements.\r\n\r\n# Refactoring/Improvements\r\n\r\n1. Establishes unit test(s). I have more work to do here to accommodate the change in logic for loading the maxmind db file(s) from the class path.\r\n2. Removes duplication of configuration documentation, including it only in `nutch-default.xml`.\r\n3. Removes `insightsService` as the default value for the `index.geoip.usage` configuration property. The value is now empty.\r\n4. Introduces a new property `index.geoip.db.file` which facilitates specifying the Maxmind DB file packaged with Nutch `.job`. \r\n5. Adds Javadoc to every Class and Method of the index-geoid plugin (more work to be done here)\r\n6. Uses the [updated GeoIP Database guidance](https://github.com/maxmind/GeoIP2-java/blob/main/README.md#database-usage), specifically\r\n  - Using the `try` methods; \"...If you are looking up many IPs that are not contained in the database, the try method will be slightly faster as they do not need to construct and throw an exception.\"\r\n  - Uses [DB Caching](https://github.com/maxmind/GeoIP2-java/blob/main/README.md#caching); \"... Using this cache, lookup performance is significantly improved at the cost of a small (~2MB) memory overhead.\"\r\n7. Updates the number of fields which are now available for each Database as new fields h ave been added to the Java API since I first wrote this plugin.\r\n8. Simplifies the values available for the `index.geoip.usage` configuration property. Available values are now `anonymous`, `asn`, `city`, `connection`, `domain`, `insights` or `isp`. **THIS IS A BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE BREAKING CHANGE** which we would need to call out in the release notes. I decided to implement this change [based on recent feedback](https://lists.apache.org/thread/1bpwqs1b890pcog8zsqgqyy1mq31tp9n) which I agree with btw.\r\n\r\n# Future work\r\n\r\nI can anticipate a use case where multiple [Maxmind DB's](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-databases) and/or [Web service looksups](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-api-web-services) may wish to be _chained_ together with the results being aggregated within one `NutchDocument`. I did not wish to complicate this PR any more though so any implementation will be described first in another Jira ticket.","created_at":"2024-09-12T23:56:39Z","updated_at":"2024-09-26T04:56:35Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ea2528eabdb2173e443f35288ca688aeca20b87c","assignee":{"login":"lewismc","id":1165719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1165719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc","html_url":"https://github.com/lewismc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lewismc","id":1165719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1165719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc","html_url":"https://github.com/lewismc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/pulls/825/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/pulls/825/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/825/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/statuses/28eb77278e1626a2d348f1b67ac7c6a1cb21a390","head":{"label":"lewismc:NUTCH-3064","ref":"NUTCH-3064","sha":"28eb77278e1626a2d348f1b67ac7c6a1cb21a390","user":{"login":"lewismc","id":1165719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1165719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc","html_url":"https://github.com/lewismc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52933441,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjkzMzQ0MQ==","name":"nutch","full_name":"lewismc/nutch","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lewismc","id":1165719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1165719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc","html_url":"https://github.com/lewismc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lewismc/nutch","description":"Mirror

is the initial code for an arbitrary indexing filter, NUTCH-3032.\r\n\r\nIt could be helpful to let end users manipulate information at indexing time with their own code without the need for writing their own indexing plugin. I mentioned this on the dev mailing list (https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@nutch.apache.org/msg31190.html) with some description of my work in progress.\r\n\r\nOne potential use is to address some of the same concerns that NUTCH-585 discusses regarding an alternative approach to picking and choosing which content to index, but this approach would allow making index time decisions, rather than setting the configuration for all content at the start of the indexing run.\r\n\r\nIdeally a solution to NUTCH-585 would work at parse time, but this index time code still has potential uses for any kind of look-ups or calculations that depend on values in the document where the need to manipulate data exceeds what something like Jexl filter can do easily, or where outside data is worth incorporating into the document for use after indexing.\r\n\r\nThanks for your contribution to [Apache Nutch](https://nutch.apache.org/)!
