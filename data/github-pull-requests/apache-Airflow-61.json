audit logs view (similar to what we do with task_id when a single task is selected)? This would be more precise than just filtering on task_id + dates, but it would exclude relevant events which aren't tagged with a run_id (for example, pausing a DAG

DAG and task objects.\r\nInternally it passes constant parameter (Airflow's `airflow.models.Param`) that is next checked in OpenLineage listener.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the

hooks, operators, and test for two Google Cloud generative model APIs. Namely, the [language model for text generation (PaLM 2)](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/text/test-text-prompts) and the [multimodal model for content generation (Gemini)](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/multimodal/send-chat-prompts-gemini). This will help data engineers begin to incorporate generative AI into their pipelines.\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n\r\nTo use the Vertex AI SDK, this PR utilizes the [google-cloud-aiplatform PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-aiplatform/) and imports the library `vertexai`. You can view the source code in the repo: [googleapis/python-aiplatform](https://github.com/googleapis/python-aiplatform/tree/main/vertexai) and review importing in the [README](https://github.com/googleapis/python-aiplatform?tab=readme-ov-file#importing).\r\n\r\nThe GenerativeModelHook in this PR differs from the ModelServiceClient (used by ModelServiceHook). The latter is used for models that the user is creating, deploying, and maintaining. Whereas the GenerativeModelHook in this PR is for models that are directly serviced by Google. The ModelServiceHook uses a separate python library from `google.cloud.aiplatform_v1.types` whereas GenerativeModelHook currently uses from `vertexai`. There seemed to be separation between the two use cases so I opted to separate for now, with potentially merging down the line when/if Google unifies them into one package.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add

The changes include the implementation of batch processing to efficiently handle large sets of DAG IDs. The motivation behind this change is to address the performance issues associated with processing a large number of DAGs, which can lead to significant memory usage and slow down the scheduler.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Batch Processing: The method now processes `DatasetDagRunQueue` records in batches, reducing memory usage and improving efficiency. This approach minimizes the overhead of loading and processing large numbers of DAGs simultaneously.\r\n- Error Handling: Improved the handling of cases where DAG serialization versions are outdated or when no dataset trigger records are found for a given DAG. \r\n\r\n_Depends on the merge of PR apache/airflow#37016._ and #37101\r\n\r\n## Dependency Checklist\r\n- [x] PR #37016 should be merged

`uv` tool released in Feb 2024 by ruff creators provides a way faster drop-in replacement to `pip` and we are using it now in our CI, when it can bring significant speed improvements (and soon possibly more features).\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces `pip install` and `pip uninstall` with equivalent `uv pip install` and `uv pip uninstall` commands, controlled by a single `AIRFLOW_USE_UV` ARG. In CI images it is set to \"true\" so CI images are prepared using UV, but PROD images (which are also used during CI tests) are built using pip. This way we can get both - stability and compliance for user-facing `pip` installation and speed and new features coming from `uv`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

openapi validators in older versions do not work well for some moto tests which use the validators.

`uv` tool released in Feb 2024 by ruff creators provides a way faster drop-in replacement to `pip` and we are using it now in our CI, when it can bring significant speed improvements (and soon possibly more features).\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces `pip install` and `pip uninstall` with equivalent `uv pip install` and `uv pip uninstall` commands, controlled by a single `AIRFLOW_USE_UV` ARG. In CI images it is set to \"true\" so CI images are prepared using UV, but PROD images (which are also used during CI tests) are built using pip. This way we can get both - stability and compliance for user-facing `pip` installation and speed and new features coming from `uv`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

modernizing the UI. Use the REST API show the Audit Log for a DAG in react.\r\n\r\nThe Audit Log shows up as a tab for every selection (dag, dag run, task, task instance). And we try to filter the Audit Log accordingly, within the limitations we have at least.\r\n\r\nRun ID isn't recorded and execution date is not currently a parameter (nor do we always record the execution date or map index anyway). So instead when there is a dag run, we filter the before/after dates to the queued at and last scheduling decision dates.\r\n\r\nAlso cleaned up the logic of what tabs to default to when changing selection.\r\n\r\nTask Instance Selected (filtered by before, after and task id)\r\n<img width=\"1191\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-02-24 at 5 09 30 PM\"

#35127\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the test coverage of the trigger_rule_dep.py module and increases code coverage from 91% to 99%. It also removes an unreachable code fragment (`upstream_setup` used to be of type `int | None`, but now only `int`) and adds some missing whitespaces to one of the failure reasons. I believe that the 3 lines that are still not covered (184, 208, 214) can't be reached without nested mapped tasks which are currently not supported.\r\n\r\nWhile the pure code coverage could have been improved by only adding a couple of tests, `test_trigger_rule_dep.py` actually only covered 85% of trigger_rule_dep.py, with the additional misses mainly coming from the `flag_upstream_failed == True` branch. There was also a chance of tests accidentally succeeding since the failure reason was often not validated (this happened in `test_always_tr`). For these reasons I opted to extend many of the existing tests. Generally this meant testing `flag_upstream_failed` being true and false as well as validating the resulting ti state.","created_at":"2024-02-24T20:32:57Z","updated_at":"2024-03-06T11:58:15Z","closed_at":"2024-03-02T19:18:38Z","merged_at":"2024-03-02T19:18:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"73a632a5a0af3fe51484e89a7bd4c771800707e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172802142,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAyMTQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:misc/internal","name":"type:misc/internal","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

\"airflow_pre_installed_providers.txt\" shoudl be included as artifact when preparing sdist package, because it is used by the hatch_build.py to post-process extras and make sure to add the pre-installed providers to wheel.\r\n\r\nHowever, the file was added in pyproject.toml without leading slash which caused that ANY airflow_pre_installed_providers.txt file in the sources root would be included. When you build source package with local hatch however, the file was actually copied to the out folder in order to create reproducible source package and the lack of slash made such file included as part of the produced sdist package (out directory is otherwise ignored by hatch due to .gitignore rules). That lead to a possibility that if you prepared tarball first and then packages using local hatch, the file would be included and sdist packages would not be binary identical.\r\n\r\nAdding leading slash eliminates the problem.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Airflow package preparation using docker, worked nicely in CI and in most cases it worked locally, however in some cases, if you had custom docker builder configured it could stop working because you could have builder configured that would not load the images built locally (this is when you earlier run buildx for caching.\r\n\r\nThis is now fixed - instead of using `buildx` plugin we use regular `docker build` plugin to build airflow packages, also we ignore `out` directory which was not ignored before and could unnecesarily increase time and size of the image build for airflow package preparation.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

release tests of 2.8.2rc2 I realized a small regression on Trigger form UI in special conditions:\r\n\r\nIf the trigger form is submitted with invalid values, the rendering of the re-display of the form generates a stack trace display with \"UndefinedError\" - \"jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'form' is undefined\".\r\n\r\nThis can be caused by the user by:\r\n\r\n1. Open a trigger form and adjust the generated JSON manually to be invalid (e.g. use example_params_ui_tutorial, set `required_field: null`) and try to submit\r\n2. If the user tries to trigger a form w/o config and the option `AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__SHOW_TRIGGER_FORM_IF_NO_PARAMS=True` is set, the DAG has required fields which are generating an invalid DAG run.\r\n\r\nRoot cause is missing to supply the \"form\" value from a rework in PR #37497 where 1 line was deleted

often get reports with results of the image scanning sent to the security team. However, for 3rd-party CVEs which are public, this is wrong way of reporting them and our users have other ways they can either handle it, or research it or contribute back their findings back and it's not clear for them that a) they have those options b) their expectations are that Airflow security team will tell them how to clear their security scan reports, c) they do not know they should (and can) contribute back.\r\n\r\nThis change restructures and clarifies the chapter that was describing it in a pretty vague way - turning it into \"How to\" guide for the users, explaining all the options they have and explaining what are the ways they can contribute back - also making it crystal clear what is the responsibility of the security team for it and that the community expects contributions in such cases from commercial users who want their security reports cleared, not the other way round.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

change (#37476) added a bit of clutter to the output of the release commands and made it a little difficult to see what is going on. This PR Fixes those issues:\r\n\r\n* stdout from venv creation, pip installation, pip wheel is hidden\r\n* stderr is still visible\r\n* check = False is used and retcode check for pip installation which gives (potentially) a bit more readable error output\r\n* list of packages in sdist is displayed after validation for packages happen - not before - this way they are nicely summarizing what is preparaed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR is created based on https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/36052\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n\r\n- [x]  Taks 1 - Refactor

connexion v3 \r\n- [x]  Taks 2 - Find a way to replace the Legacy environ_overrides method from the old version of Connexion to fix the problem in tests.\r\n- [x]  Task 3 - Fix unit tests that use app\r\n\r\n##  Taks 1 - Refactor get_api_endpoints()\r\n### Problem Definiton\r\n\r\nRef: [Github Pull Request #36052 VladaZakharova commented on Jan 18](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/36052#issuecomment-1898612794)\r\n\r\nIn the `init_api_auth_provider` method, we update the base path as follows:\r\n```\r\ndef init_api_auth_provider(connexion_app: connexion.FlaskApp):\r\n    \"\"\"Initialize the API offered by the auth manager.\"\"\"\r\n    auth_mgr = get_auth_manager()\r\n    blueprint = auth_mgr.get_api_endpoints(connexion_app)\r\n    if blueprint:\r\n        base_paths.append(blueprint.url_prefix if blueprint.url_prefix else \"\")\r\n        flask_app = connexion_app.app\r\n        flask_app.extensions[\"csrf\"].exempt(blueprint)\r\n\r\n```\r\nHowever, the `blueprint` object obtained from `auth_mgr.get_api_endpoints(connexion_app)` will always be `None` if we are using **ConnexionV3**.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\nRef [vincbeck commented on Jan 18](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/36052#issuecomment-1898786641)\r\n\r\n- Rename `get_api_endpoints` to `set_api_endpoints`. The return type should be updated to `None`. Documentation should be updated as well to something like \"Set API endpoint(s) definition for the auth manager.\". This is a breaking change but nobody uses this interface yet, so it is a good time to do it.\r\n- ~~This piece of code `flask_app.extensions[\"csrf\"].exempt(blueprint)` should be moved in the `set_api_endpoints` method using `appbuilder.app.extensions[\"csrf\"].exempt(api.blueprint)`~~ Ref: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/37638#issuecomment-1962060087\r\n\r\n### How to test\r\n- **Run client tests** `python ./clients/python/test_python_client.py`\r\n\r\n### Subtasks\r\n\r\n- [ ]  Hanlde logic for `base_paths.append(blueprint.url_prefix if blueprint.url_prefix else \"\")`\r\n- [x]  Make sure the base path for the `CSRF` exemption is correct. Ref: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/37638#discussion_r1509398492\r\n- [x] Handle `swagger-ui` installation, Ref: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/37638#discussion_r1502453187\r\n- [ ] Solve `favicon.ico` problem in the swagger UI. \r\n\r\n## Task 2 - Replace envrion_overrides argument\r\n### Problem Definition \r\nRef: [Github Pull Request #36052 commented on Feb 6](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/36052#:~:text=for%20available%20options)\r\n\r\n>Find a way to replace legacy environ_overrides method from old version of Connexion to fix the problem in tests\r\nTypeError: get() got an unexpected keyword argument 'environ_overrides'. Contact @RobbeSneyders for some help. Currently we didn't find anything in their documentation regarding new way how to override env variables.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- Use headers to send `{'REMOTE_USER:\"user\"}` instead of using environ_overirdes argument inside testclient.method. Accordinly update the authentication part in  `tests/test_utils/remote_user_api_auth_backend.py` to `user_id = request.headers.get(\"REMOTE_USER\")`

commit delivers an isolated component of AIP-61: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-61+Hybrid+Execution\r\n\r\nIt updates the executor loader logic to allow configuring multiple executors (and aliases per executor) in a list form (comma delimited) from airflow configuration; as well as associated methods for core Airflow code to load the default executor (first executor in the list) or any other configured executor.\r\n\r\nTesting is included with the changes but not documentation, because AIP-61 is not yet complete. The code delivered is behind gating logic that will prohibit users from accidentally using it. User facing documentation will be delivered when the entire AIP-61 feature is fully completed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Some part added to the docs are sourced from current OL Airflow integration docs on [OL website](https://openlineage.io/docs/integrations/airflow/), but they have been updated to work for the provider package. I believe it's the right direction to keep everything here, as we may want to remove OL website docs on Airflow integration in the future, as it's mostly living in the provider package.\r\n\r\nI also simplified the Menu structure, so it's easier to find everything and it's not as nested as before.\r\n\r\nLet me know what You think, if there is something missing, misleading, not clear enough etc. Any feedback is highly appreciated.\r\n\r\n## How to view the new docs ?\r\nThe easiest way is to use [BREEZE](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/breeze/doc/README.rst) and run:\r\n```\r\nbreeze build-docs --package-filter apache-airflow-providers-openlineage --clean-build\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen You can run the server with:\r\n```\r\n sh docs/start_doc_server.sh\r\n```\r\nand view the docs at [localhost](http://localhost:8000/docs/apache-airflow-providers-openlineage/stable/guides/structure.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Next steps\r\nI think we need a new version of [this](https://openlineage.io/assets/images/af-schematic-ad8c295a182cb32b94ee27b96727fa98.svg) image, with `provider` instead of `openlineage-airflow`, included on the Intro page. I will try to update it, and as soon as we host it somewhere, we can do the switch.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead

PR introduces the AWS Batch Executor. This Executor can be configured to run Airflow tasks using AWS Batch. It is based on an initial contribution from @aelzeiny.\r\n\r\nFrom the README:\r\n```\r\nThis is an Airflow executor powered by Amazon Batch. Each task scheduled by Airflow is run inside a\r\nseparate container, scheduled by Batch. Some benefits of an executor like this include:\r\n\r\n1. Scalability and Lower Costs: AWS Batch allows the ability to dynamically provision the resources needed to execute tasks.\r\n   Depending on the resources allocated, AWS Batch can autoscale up or down based on the workload,\r\n   ensuring efficient resource utilization and reducing costs.\r\n2. Job Queues and Priority: AWS Batch provides the concept of job queues, allowing\r\n   the ability to prioritize and manage the execution of tasks. This ensures that when multiple\r\n   tasks are scheduled simultaneously, they are executed in the desired order of priority.\r\n3. Flexibility: AWS Batch supports Fargate (ECS), EC2 and EKS compute environments. This range of\r\n   compute environments, as well as the ability to finely define the resources allocated to\r\n   the compute environments gives a lot of flexibility to users in choosing the most suitable\r\n   execution environment for their workloads.\r\n4. Rapid Task Execution: By maintaining an active worker within AWS Batch, tasks submitted to\r\n   the service can be executed swiftly. With a ready-to-go worker, there's minimal startup delay,\r\n   ensuring tasks commence immediately upon submission. This feature is particularly advantageous\r\n   for time-sensitive workloads or applications requiring near-real-time processing,\r\n   enhancing overall workflow efficiency and responsiveness.\r\n```\r\nThis PR comes with *most* features now included in the ECS Executor, but we will continue to update both executors as we work to improve them. \r\n\r\nReview Notes\r\n------------------\r\nSimilar to the ECS Executor, this PR comes as a fully functional feature, which is great for testing, but it does mean that the PR is large. When reviewing, it isn't necessary to go through every single line. Instead, it would be more beneficial to have read through the documentation, and glance at how the Executor is implemented. \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of similarities in the code between the Batch Executor and the ECS Executor - this is by design. As we continue to refine the process of writing custom Executors, we are converging on an optimal framework to write efficient, reliable, and fault-tolerant custom Executors. \r\n\r\nTesting\r\n---------\r\nThere is extensive unit testing which has near 100% line coverage in most cases:\r\n![BatchExecutorCodeCoverage](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/103602455/71fc531f-c2e1-4592-b2a3-15eb3684e60f)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
