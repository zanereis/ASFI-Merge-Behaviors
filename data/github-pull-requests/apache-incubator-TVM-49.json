scheduling 2D softmax, the current cuda schedule assumes the reduction axis to be the last axis, and yields incorrect schedule and raise error messages that are hard to debug. For example, running the follow snippet:\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm\r\nfrom tvm import relay\r\n\r\nshape = (64, 2)\r\ndtype = 'float32'\r\n\r\nA = relay.var('A', shape=shape, dtype=dtype)\r\nB = relay.nn.softmax(A, axis=0)\r\nf = relay.Function([A], B)\r\nmod = tvm.IRModule.from_expr(f)\r\n\r\ndev = tvm.cuda()\r\ntarget = tvm.target.Target('cuda')\r\nwith tvm.transform.PassContext(opt_level=0):\r\n    executor = relay.build_module.create_executor(\r\n        'graph', mod, dev, target).evaluate()\r\n```\r\nI got \r\n```Check failed: (!UsesVar(local_index, [this](const VarNode* var) { return var == warp_index_.get(); })) is false: LowerWarpMemory failed to rewrite load to shuffle for index ((threadIdx.x*5) + (k.inner*2)) local_index=(((threadIdx.x*5) + (k.inner*2))/32)```\r\nwith `opt_level=0` and \r\n```Check failed: (match) is false: iter_var(blockIdx.x, , blockIdx.x) domain already inferred, cannot prove their extents are the same 64 vs 2```\r\nwith `opt_level=4`. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the schedule to also support axis=0 for all the cuda 2D schedules and enhances the unit testing to test all reduction axes.","created_at":"2022-06-21T16:29:54Z","updated_at":"2022-06-21T20:20:56Z","closed_at":"2022-06-21T20:20:56Z","merged_at":"2022-06-21T20:20:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"b63801c4cd79508eec4d0d210cf62764dfacf6e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11803/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11803/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11803/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/ce49d4732b59ef367eb9c5c925dcec1b53f1f07c","head":{"label":"lazycal:softmax-schedule-axis","ref":"softmax-schedule-axis","sha":"ce49d4732b59ef367eb9c5c925dcec1b53f1f07c","user":{"login":"lazycal","id":7333325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMzMzMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7333325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal","html_url":"https://github.com/lazycal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":389782909,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODk3ODI5MDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"lazycal/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lazycal","id":7333325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMzMzMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7333325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal","html_url":"https://github.com/lazycal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazycal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lazycal/tvm","description":"Open

`cpu-flush` option existed as a boolean or integer argument, which is a bit counter-intuitive because for argparse, any non-empty string such as `False` will be parsed to `True` when using as a boolean and integer a little bit vague here IMHO. This PR used a function from `distutils` to directly parse input string to boolean, which makes the usage more stragiht-forward like `--cpu-flush True` or `--cpu-flush False`. Meanwhile it still supports usage of `0/1` and made sure the argument is always required.\r\n\r\nCC: @junrushao1994

is a proposal to fix the changes of header reboot file locations in zephyr version 2.6.0. \r\n Reboot functionality has been moved to subsys/os from subsys/power. A consequence of this movement is that the <power/reboot.h> header has been moved to <sys/reboot.h>. <power/reboot.h> is still provided for compatibility, but it will produce a warning to inform users of the relocation.\r\n\r\nSince the microtvm demo zephyr dependency is 2.7.0 this should not be a breaking changes. Problem is that from zephyr version 3 there is no more a relocation warning and compilation will fail with old location of reboot.h\r\n\r\nFYI @mehrdadh\n\ncc @alanmacd

PR adds utilities for autotuning with microTVM and evaluating the subsequently generated AOT-compiled model to `tvm.micro.testing`. A example end-to-end autotuning test is also added to `tests/micro/common/test_autotune.py`, which works for Arduino and Zephyr. This will be the only working autotuning test for microTVM, but it will not be run on the CI, as `@tvm.testing.requires_micro` is set (it requires physical hardware). The test takes about three minutes to run on the Sony Spresense.\r\n\r\nA few other changes in this PR:\r\n- A `fetch_model_from_url` function is added to reduce redundant logic for importing models\r\n- The tests in `tests/micro/common` are changed to be parameterized with the platform as well as the board. This eliminates the need for tests to decide whether a board is an Arduino or Zephyr board, and allows us to support boards that are compatible with both.\r\n- The `yes_no.tflite` model has been removed, and been replaced by using `fetch_model_from_url` to download it. This is the same model downloaded by `test_tvmc.py`. \r\n- The timing utilites for Zephyr have been changed to use the `timing/timing.h`, as our previous implementation was complicated and had bugs.\r\n\r\ncc @alanmacd @gromero

tried to do to the TensorRT integration what #11631 did to the CUTLASS integration, viz:\r\n - Make sure all compilation options are passed in Target instances. This helps Collage.\r\n - Use a custom pass invoked via RelayToTIRTargetHooks instead of the relay.ext.$toolchain mechanism.\r\n   This helps use decouple external codegen from lowering.\r\n\r\nThis PR collects the prep for that change:\r\n - TensorRT uses the JSONSerializer visitor to encode each partition function. Previously, when the\r\n   visitor encountered a Constant it simply generated and recorded a name for the constant. Then,\r\n   completely separately, and via a callback in TECompiler, the function is visited again in the\r\n   same order and with the same name generation convention by a ConstantUpdater to actually collect the\r\n   bindings, which are then encoded into a ConstLoaderModule to be made available at runtime.\r\n\r\n   However if all TensorRT compilation is to be done by a stand-alone pass there's no TECompiler callback\r\n   hackery available. So I've added a \"const_name_to_ndarray\" attribute to the IRModule of type\r\n   Map<String, runtime::NDArray> so that named constants can be accumulated throughout compilation by\r\n   any pass which needs to do so. Then the Graph, AOT and VM executors are all updated to merge those\r\n   constants into the final runtime artifact\r\n\r\n   (Compare with \"Constants\", the equivalent attribute for extracting TIR AllocateConsts.)\r\n\r\n - The TensorRT tests use the create_executor interface but it wasn't quite ready for the\r\n   new more general form of passing list-of-targets.\r\n\r\n - I want TensorRT compilation to work out of the box without the need for any special targets if\r\n   all the default options should apply. Go back and make the CUTLASS integration I did follow the\r\n   same convention.\r\n\r\n - To test this I also switched the 'demo' \"ccompiler\" external codegen target to IRModule-at-a-time\r\n    style. This means we can test most of external codegen machinery in one place without depending on\r\n    any target which may not be enabled in CI (eg TensorRT):\r\n     - Target instances are plumbed correctly so compile-time options are available.\r\n     - External modules are conveyed to the final export library.\r\n     - Constant bindings are conveyed to the metadata module.","created_at":"2022-06-17T21:01:34Z","updated_at":"2022-07-19T10:48:06Z","closed_at":"2022-06-30T17:27:22Z","merged_at":"2022-06-30T17:27:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"985680ee1ae77ebe51f373df64063f8372e6cb6e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11770/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11770/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11770/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/ea69f71c9c67c796e7ea2769c61cd13e1b544edf","head":{"label":"mbs-octoml:mbs-prep-for-trt","ref":"mbs-prep-for-trt","sha":"ea69f71c9c67c796e7ea2769c61cd13e1b544edf","user":{"login":"mbs-octoml","id":87091372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDkxMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87091372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":386444680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODY0NDQ2ODA=","name":"mbs-tvm","full_name":"mbs-octoml/mbs-tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mbs-octoml","id":87091372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDkxMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87091372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml/mbs-tvm","description":"Open

described in #11707, the RPC mechanism does not support objects of type Map which breaks the use of tvmc run when using RPC after #9889. This commit intends to workaround this issue by providing a fallback to the old implementation when RPC is being used. Further, a test has been provided to help prevent this regression in the future.\r\n\r\ncc @leandron @leeexyz @masahi @Mousius @gromero

PR fixes a bug in the pass Narrow-Datatype in TIR, where dtype of\r\ncertain IterVar and loop variables are adjusted to narrower ones.\r\n\r\nThe bug occurs when the dtype of thread axis is int32, while its extent\r\nis int64, where the original behavior will not narrow the extent to\r\nint32, which causes an assertion thrown in IterVar's constructor. An\r\nalternative approach is to re-dtype IterVar to int64, however, the\r\nsubsequent passes do not actually respect int64 thread axes, which leads\r\nto even more issues in lowering.\r\n\r\nThis bug prevents AutoTIR in tuning Huggingface DistilBERT.","created_at":"2022-06-15T05:03:41Z","updated_at":"2022-06-15T06:56:23Z","closed_at":"2022-06-15T06:56:23Z","merged_at":"2022-06-15T06:56:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"954a927be3bb00076ae66b3997483f7ce9b4c355","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11725/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11725/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11725/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/91f77492578274b0edb88b067fa696b03ad46054","head":{"label":"junrushao:bugfix/2022-06-14/tir-narrow-dtype-mismatch","ref":"bugfix/2022-06-14/tir-narrow-dtype-mismatch","sha":"91f77492578274b0edb88b067fa696b03ad46054","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445038278,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoa-xg","name":"tvm","full_name":"junrushao/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao/tvm","description":"Open

that we are cleaning up the test directory (see https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/11414), I thought this might be a good time to update pylint.\r\n\r\nDepends on https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/11733\r\n\r\nFurthermore we partially relax rules for variable names to allow most 1-2 lower case character names and 1 character upper case names (which are used a lot in the tests).\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\n\r\nA lot of tests are like:\r\n```\r\ndef test_multi_kernel():\r\n    # graph\r\n    n = tvm.runtime.convert(1024)\r\n    A = te.placeholder((n,), name=\"A\")\r\n    B = te.placeholder((n,), name=\"B\")\r\n    C = te.compute(A.shape, lambda *i: A(*i) + B(*i), name=\"C\")\r\n    D = te.compute(A.shape, lambda *i: A(*i) + C(*i), name=\"D\")\r\n    s = te.create_schedule(D.op)\r\n    # create iter var and assign them tags.\r\n    px, x = s[C].split(C.op.axis[0], nparts=1)\r\n    s[C].bind(px, te.thread_axis(\"pipeline\"))\r\n    px, x = s[D].split(D.op.axis[0], nparts=1)\r\n    s[D].bind(px, te.thread_axis(\"pipeline\"))\r\n\r\n    # one line to build the function.\r\n    def check_device(device, host=\"llvm\"):\r\n        if not tvm.testing.device_enabled(device):\r\n            return\r\n        dev = tvm.device(device, 0)\r\n        fadd = tvm.build(s, [A, B, C, D], device, host, name=\"myadd\")\r\n        dev = tvm.device(device, 0)\r\n        # launch the kernel.\r\n        n = 1024\r\n        a = tvm.nd.array(np.random.uniform(size=n).astype(A.dtype), dev)\r\n        b = tvm.nd.array(np.random.uniform(size=n).astype(B.dtype), dev)\r\n        c = tvm.nd.array(np.random.uniform(size=n).astype(C.dtype), dev)\r\n        d = tvm.nd.array(np.random.uniform(size=n).astype(D.dtype), dev)\r\n        fadd(a, b, c, d)\r\n        tvm.testing.assert_allclose(d.numpy(), a.numpy() * 2 + b.numpy(), rtol=1e-5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere

PR is a minor fix on the AutoTVM int8 vnni dense task extraction.\r\nVNNI dense strategy is used only when the input-weight-out datatypes are u8s8s32 and the weight layout is NC16n4c.\r\nWithout altering the weight layout, for a simple dense workload:\r\n\r\ndef @main(%data: Tensor[(1, 16), uint8] /* ty=Tensor[(1, 16), uint8] /, %weight: Tensor[(32, 16), int8] / ty=Tensor[(32, 16), int8] /)

extracted:\r\n[Task(func_name=dense_nopack.x86, args=(('TENSOR', (1, 16), 'uint8'), ('TENSOR', (32, 16), 'int8'), None, 'int32'), kwargs={}, workload=('dense_nopack.x86', ('TENSOR', (1, 16), 'uint8'),

microTVM support for the Raspberry Pi Pico, which uses the Raspberry Pi foundation's RP2040 microcontroller. It worked out of the box when using the [community-built SDK](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico), so this PR only includes changes to add it to the RVM and allow `rpipico` to be passed to TVMC.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that there is a [different, now-deprecated SDK](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-mbed) written by Arduino, which was also for the Raspberry Pi Pico. However, this SDK has [a major bug](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-API/pull/163) that stops microTVM from working on it. It's not an issue though, as the RP2040 version of this SDK is deprecated anyway.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes the ESP32 base URL to use a fixed version, instead of a floating one.\n\ncc @alanmacd

activates the code from #11329 behind a couple Jenkins flags:\n* `USE_AUTOUPDATED_DOCKER_IMAGES` - whether or not to use the dynamically determined docker images in the build\n* `PUSH_DOCKER_IMAGES` - whether or not to push built images to `tlcpack` on `main`\n\nThese are there so we can quickly toggle this behavior off it breaks anything. Once this is on though, any docker changes in a PR should be reflected entirely in that build, so there would be no need for a separate PR to update the Docker images.\n\nWe will have to see if this works in practice, as the docker image builds do download quite a bit of data (which can flake) and add some runtime overhead (about 30m), so when an update lands all PRs will end up needing to rebuild until the merged commit finishes.\n\nThanks for contributing to TVM!
