This was\n  addressed by adding a functools.cache on the function\n- The Bedrock example dag was setting/caching the underlying conn object\n  globally. This was addressed by making the Airflow connection a global,\n  rather than the Bedrock conn.

incorrect number of commited rows when `executemany` is supported by the database.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior is like this:\r\n```\r\n[2025-01-19, 16:51:32 UTC] {sql.py:681} INFO - Loaded 1000 rows into postgres.public.my_table so far\r\n[2025-01-19, 16:51:32 UTC] {sql.py:681} INFO - Loaded 1000 rows into postgres.public.my_table so far\r\n[2025-01-19, 16:51:32 UTC] {sql.py:681} INFO - Loaded

INFO - Loaded 1000 rows into postgres.public.my_table so far\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince it says 'so far', logging the accumulated number of rows commited makes more sense:\r\n```\r\n[2025-01-19, 16:51:32

also solves quite a few teething issues with providers move:\r\n\r\n* Boring-Cyborg only needs only one-liner now for new providers\r\n* Additional-Extras in new provider is moved to \"optional-dependencies\"\r\n  in pyproject.toml\r\n* generated pyproject.toml in new providers has better comments now\r\n  explaining that dependencies can be edited in-place even if the file\r\n  is generated\r\n* comments in dependencies are preserved when regenerating the\r\n  pyproject.toml files\r\n* missing cross-project dependencies are added as optional-extras\r\n  automatically when regenerating pyproject.toml\r\n* LICENSE file for providers does not contain additional projects\r\n  that are included in Airflow LICENCE\r\n* Provider package tests do not have `__init__.py` in `providers`\r\n  package - this way `celery` import is not importing the celery\r\n  package from tests.providers\r\n* When preparing package with --version-suffix-for-pypi - the\r\n  pyproject.toml is updated temporarily with suffix added to airflow\r\n  dependencies\r\n* various constants in breeze code refering to providers were moved\r\n  to path_utils and made consistent\r\n* in case generated pyproject.toml file with pypi suffix has an error,\r\n  content of it is printed when generating package. Also the content of\r\n  pyproject.toml is printed when --verbose flag is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

should only be used to avoid model validation as mentioned in https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/#creating-models-without-validation\r\n\r\n>Pydantic also provides the model_construct() method, which allows models to be created without validation. This can be useful in at least a few cases:\r\n>\r\n> when working with complex data that is already known to be valid (for performance reasons)\r\n> when one or more of the validator functions are non-idempotent\r\n> when one or more of the validator functions have side effects that you don't want to be triggered.\r\n\r\nWith Warning:\r\n\r\n> `model_construct()` does not do any validation, meaning it can create models which are invalid. You should only ever use the model_construct() method with data which has already been validated, or that you definitely trust.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"786\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c423acc-8295-44c4-a5a9-622f7335cef9\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

plan to support FAB auth manager in Airflow 3 is:\r\n- Create a trimmed version of the Airflow 2 Flask application in FAB provider. This is done ✅ \r\n- Embed this Flask application in fastapi application using `WSGIMiddleware` when FAB auth manager is the auth manager configured in the Airflow environment. This is done ✅ \r\n- Update the FAB provider Flask application login process to be compatible with Airflow 3 UI. This is this PR\r\n- Update `get_url_login` method in FAB auth manager to return the appropriate login URL so that the fastapi application can retrieve this value and pass it to the front-end. On the front-end, if the user is not authenticated, it will redirect the user to this URL. It will be done in a future PR.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nYou can test this PR by going to `<endpoint>/auth/login`and enter credentials. If you get successfully authenticated you'll be redirected to Airflow 3 UI with a JWT token.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Any CLI command started taking ~ 1s longer to start. That is because importing anything from `airflow` resulted in importing `kubernetes` client. It is effectively the most expensive import out of all CLI does for any command, even though it is used by very few commands. Here are the timings of a trivial `airflow dag-processor --help`\r\n  - Before this PR: 6.0s https://pastebin.com/zb0QHFq9\r\n  - After this PR: 4.97s https://pastebin.com/QC5Rbyt5\r\n 2. Some time ago the compatibility import broke altogether. Because of the amount of imports in `pod_generator.py`, the import from `exceptions.py` failed even if providers were up to date with recursive import. But it was caught by exception handling, resulting in `from airflow.exceptions import PodMutationHookException` and `from airflow.providers.cncf.kubernetes.pod_generator import PodMutationHookException` pointing to different classes defeating the purpose of the fallback.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses both by moving PodGenerator exceptions to the separate module that only import its base class. This keeps imports backwards compatible, doesn't attempt to load k8s modules and fixes the divergence of exception classes in `airflow.providers.cncf.kubernetes.pod_generator` and `airflow.exceptions`.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting, that all usages of those exceptions in core Airflow also has been cleaned up since then, so if you believe that we need to remove those exceptions from `airflow/exceptions.py`, please let me know.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

problem resolved in this PR:\r\n- `max_form_parts` (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/api/#flask.Request.max_form_parts) is not configurable in Airflow web server (1000 is the default value).\r\n- `max_form_parts` is relevant for a \"role edit\" form in Airflow UI.\r\n- Size of the role (number of permissions) contributes to the number of form parts in POST request generated by Airflow UI.\r\n- There are real-life cases (roles with hundreds of permissions) where max_form_parts is exceeded (error 413) and blocks updating roles through the Airflow UI.\r\n\r\nIn order to overcome this limitation, two more webserver config options were introduced:\r\n- `[webserver]max_form_parts = 1000`\r\n- `[webserver]max_form_memory_size = 500000`","created_at":"2025-01-17T13:56:16Z","updated_at":"2025-01-29T15:26:34Z","closed_at":"2025-01-29T15:25:45Z","merged_at":"2025-01-29T15:25:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"bb2aaef342ddee8a8c8ad7120ac8484e6c7f10d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jscheffl","id":95105677,"node_id":"U_kgDOBasyjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95105677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl","html_url":"https://github.com/jscheffl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes compatibility issue between HTTP 0.2.7 and 0.28 regarding proxy configuration in KiotaRequestAdapterHook, that way we are future proof when Airflow would use the newer httpx library in the future.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed an issue with retry_execute method in MSGraphSensor due to missing event parameter, updated unit test for that case.\r\n\r\nWe thought the issue was fixed in previous [PR](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/45741) regarding difference between HTTPX 0.27 and 0.28 but is was not, this should fix it now.\r\n\r\nWould be nice if this [PR](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/45478/) could also be merged as this will allow re-usability of test helpers which where first used here.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--

message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe previous PR [#45464](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/45464) did some changes to be HTTPX 0.28.x, unfortunately it broke the parametrization of the proxies parameter, this is fixed in this PR.\r\n\r\nAs the proxies parameter is deprecated in HTTPX 0.27.x and is removed in 0.28.x, it was wrongly assigned to the mounts parameter, it should in fact be assigned to the proxy parameter, this PR fixes it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

These workflows have the ability to orchestrate the execution of Unified Studio artifacts that can connect to data assets stored in a SUS project. \r\n\r\nImplementation-wise, these notebooks are executed on a SageMaker Training Job running a [SageMaker Distribution ](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-distribution) environment within the context of a SUS project.\r\n\r\n### Components\r\n- **SageMakerNotebookOperator:** this operator allows users to execute Unified Studio artifacts within the context of their project.\r\n- **SageMakerNotebookHook:** this hook provides a wrapper around the notebook execution\r\n- **SageMakerNotebookSensor:** this sensor waits on status updates from the notebook execution\r\n- **SageMakerNotebookJobTrigger:** this trigger activates when the notebook execution completes\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nNote that this operator introduces a dependency on the SageMaker Studio SDK https://www.pypi.org/project/sagemaker-studio\r\n```python\r\nwith DAG(...) as dag:\r\n    ...\r\n    run_notebook = SageMakerNotebookOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"initial\",\r\n        input_config={\"input_path\": <notebook_path_in_s3>, \"input_params\": {}},\r\n        output_config={\"output_formats\": [\"NOTEBOOK\"]},\r\n        wait_for_completion=True,\r\n        poll_interval=5,\r\n    )\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nMWAA uses python 3.11 and postgres backend, so we will set those values for all tests.\r\n### Unit tests\r\n```shell\r\nbreeze testing core-tests -p 3.11 -b postgres providers/tests/amazon/aws/*/test_sagemaker_unified_studio.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n### System tests\r\nEnsure a properly configured SageMaker Unified Domain and Project as indicated in the `example_sagemaker_unified_studio.py` file. Also ensure AWS credentials are populated and up to date. Then, populate the `DOMAIN_ID`, `PROJECT_ID`, `ENVIRONMENT_ID`, and `S3_PATH` in `files/airflow-breeze-config/variables.env` and run:\r\n```shell\r\nbreeze testing system-tests -p 3.11 -b postgres --forward-credentials --test-timeout 600 providers/tests/system/amazon/aws/example_sagemaker_unified_studio.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of

did a little work to try to make the code a little clearer in the dag processor where we compare versions.  Instead of current and new, which is confusing, I call it pre-refresh and after-refresh, essentially, which makes the logic a little more intelligible.  Also I provide a var `was seen` to show the intention of the `name in list` check.\r\n\r\n2. I propose (and do so here) renaming `latest_version` to `version` in bundle for reasons similar to https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/45719.  I think it makes sense to think of the orm object as _itself_ representing the latest or current or last refreshed version. So the latest version cannot itself _have_ a latest version -- the latest version just has a version.  That's sorta conceptually the issue.  In any event, by saying less, we can let the docs explain the nuance.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-16T20:05:47Z","updated_at":"2025-01-16T23:24:10Z","closed_at":"2025-01-16T23:24:08Z","merged_at":"2025-01-16T23:24:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"060eeb73d3636f7ff692acb6c61c7ff948c3574f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

up after #45690\r\n\r\nWee already had protection against example dags not using database, but it turns out that just calling get_connection() of the BaseHook involves calling out to secrets manager which - depending on the configuration, providers and where it is called - might cause external calls, timeout and various side effects.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds explicit test for that. As part of the change we also added `--load-example-dags` and `--load-default-connections` to breeze shell as it allows to easily test the case where default connections are loaded in the database.\r\n\r\nNote that the \"example_bedrock_retrieve_and_generate\" explicitly avoided attempting to load the connections by specifing aws_conn_id to None, because it was likely causing problems with fetching SSM when get_connection was actually called during dag parsing, so this aws_conn_id = None would also bypass this check, but we can't do much about it - at least after this chanege, the contributor will see failing test with explicit \"get_connection() should not be called during DAG parsing\".\r\n\r\nThat also makes the example dag more of a \"real\" example as it does not nullify the connection id and it can use \"aws_default\" connection to actually ... be a good example. Also it allows to run the example dag as system test for someone who would like to do it with \"aws_default\" as a connection id to connect to their AWS account.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

is a minimalist auth manager in core Airflow. It defines its own login form in order for users to log in. Example below:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2025-01-15 at 5 06 01 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9070abec-0c13-4193-8a49-9753e5d137a9)\r\n\r\nSimple auth manager has its UI defined using Flask, you can then use it with Airflow 2 UI. But the goal is to use simple auth manager in Airflow 3. In order to use simple auth manager with Airflow 3 UI, we need to implement its views in the fastapi application. This is the goal of this PR.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR is merged, I'll remove the UI/views definitions of simple auth manager in Flask. We do not need the simple auth manager to be compatible with Airflow 2 UI (although that was necessary for testing it).\r\n\r\nAs a result of this PR, multiple endpoints are added:\r\n- <env_endpoint>/auth/webapp/login: the login form\r\n- <env_endpoint>/auth/static/assets/index-......js: the JS/React artifact defining the login form\r\n- POST <env_endpoint>/auth/token: to create a JWT token given username and password\r\n\r\n(Sorry for the massive PR).\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nTo test this PR and play around with the simple auth manager login form:\r\n\r\n* Set export `AIRFLOW__CORE__AUTH_MANAGER=\"airflow.auth.managers.simple.simple_auth_manager.SimpleAuthManager\"`\r\n* In `airflow/auth/managers/simple/ui/`, run npm run build. I need to update the pre-commit script to do that automatically\r\n* Run Airflow and go to <endpoint>/auth/webapp/login\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\nThis is a simple draft with PoC of AIP-85 https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-85+Extendable+DAG+parsing+controls.\r\n\r\nThe key highlights and proposed interfaces/implementations are:\r\n1) `airflow/dag_processing/dag_importer.py`: DagImporter - a mechanism abstracting a way of how a \"path\" is translated into one or more parsed DAGs. \r\n   - Default implementation is `FSDagImporter` (`airflow/dag_processing/fs_dag_importer.py`) - read a DAG from definition in a Python file. \r\n   - Alternative \"demo\" implementation - `NotebooksImporter` (`providers/src/airflow/providers/google/common/importers/notebooks_importer.py`), which imports Python definitions from Jupyter notebook files (for demonstration purposes only, not part of the actual AIP).\r\n\r\n2) `airflow/dag_processing/dag_ingester.py`: DagIngester - a mechanism to abstract away the logic of operations of parsing/adding/updating/removing DAGs and their importing metadata (i.e. importing errors/warnings). Sample implementations:\r\n   - Continuous ingester (`airflow/dag_processing/continuous_ingester.py`) - replication of the current regular dag-processor paring logic (by reusing current DagFileProcessingManagers)\r\n   - Once ingester (`airflow/dag_processing/once_ingester.py`) - ingester that only imports DAGs once\r\n\r\nThose 2 interfaces (that are allowed to be extended by providers/core Airflow) build a foundation to address AIP-85 requirements - increase flexibility of how DAGs are being updated and how they can be defined.\r\n\r\nApart from that, DagBag usage is replaced in most places with one of the following components:\r\n  - DagStore (`airflow/dag_processing/dag_store.py`) - access to Airflow DAGs in metadata DBs (no access to DAG sources required). Used by any component that requires access to DAG's metadata (i.e. by scheduler, public API, etc.).\r\n  - DagParser (`airflow/dag_processing/dag_parser.py`) - access to parsed DAGs (used by worker and dag-processor).\r\n\r\nA lot of things are \"swept under the rug\" here as this is just a PoC based on an older Airflow branch before most of Airflow 3 changes landed. Big things that are missing:\r\n  - Callbacks are not yet moved to a separate component (temporarily disabled)\r\n  - Integration with bundles\r\n  - Missing optimizations around module importing\r\n  - DagCode is not propagated for non-FSDagImporter\r\n\r\n\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow

doesn't affect \"production\"/when running the dag parser normally as it\nruns things in a subprocess per dag file already, but in our tests, especially\nthe serialized DAG ones, we often process files directly.\n\nI discovered this when running tests locally where I didn't have the required\npackages for Terradata installed and this... caused the entire test to be\nskipped!\n\nThis is because the example dag file has `pytest.skip()` in a try/exepct\nImportError block, and since that exception does not inherit from Exception\n(only BaseExecption) it was bubbling all the way up to the pytest runner and\ncausing `TestStringifiedDAGs::test_serialization` to be marked as skipped --\nnot really what we want. This change will also now make it capture `exit()` in\na DAG file and record that as an import error where as before I think it would\nhave just not parsed anything from that file.\n\nIn short, this doesn't affect things outside of tests, but it's more correct\nto do it this way.\n\n<!--\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n or more contributor license agreements.

Why\r\n\r\nSince https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/44378, we have implemented a newsfragments template to track the breaking changes we have made. However, this template was introduced after many of our earlier breaking changes, which means that most of the existing news fragments do not conform to this format. By updating the existing entries to match the template, we will be able to create a script that summarizes the breaking changes made in Airflow 3.0.\r\n\r\n## What\r\n\r\nUpdate existing significant newsfragments with the type of changes and migration rules we added in https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/41641\r\n\r\nCloses: #45673 \r\n\r\n - [ ] #41453 @uranusjr\r\n - [x] #40029 @jscheffl\r\n - [ ] #40931 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #41096 @dirrao\r\n - [x] #41348 @Lee-W\r\n - [ ] #41366 @jedcunningham\r\n - [ ] #41367 @jedcunningham\r\n - [ ] #41368 @jedcunningham\r\n - [x] #41390 @kaxil\r\n - [ ] #41391 @kaxil\r\n - [ ] #41435 @vincbeck\r\n - [x] #41394 @kaxil\r\n - [ ] #41395 @kaxil\r\n - [ ] #41695 @Avihais12344\r\n - [x] #41434 @vincbeck\r\n - [ ] #41440 @dstandish\r\n - [ ] #41453 @uranusjr\r\n - [ ] #41496 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #41520 @dirrao\r\n - [x] #41533 @gopidesupavan\r\n - [ ] #41539 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #41550 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #41552 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #41579 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #41609 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #41635 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #41642 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #41663 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #41693 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #41708 @dirrao\r\n - [x] #41733 @jscheffl\r\n - [x] #41735 @jscheffl\r\n - [x] #41736 @jscheffl\r\n - [x] #41737 @jscheffl\r\n - [ ] #41739 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #41748 @dirrao\r\n - [x] #41758 @jscheffl\r\n - [x] #41761 @jscheffl\r\n - [x] #41762 @jscheffl\r\n - [x] #41774 @jscheffl\r\n - [x] #41776 @jscheffl\r\n - [x] #41778 @jscheffl\r\n - [x] #41779 @jscheffl\r\n - [x] #41780 @jscheffl\r\n - [ ] #41784 @dirrao\r\n - [x] #41808 @jscheffl\r\n - [x] #41857 @pierrejeambrun\r\n - [ ] #41910 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #41964 @jedcunningham\r\n - [ ] #41975 @dirrao\r\n - [x] #42023 @Lee-W\r\n - [x] #42042 @vincbeck\r\n - [ ] #42066 @topherinternational\r\n - [ ] #42060 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #42088 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #42100 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #42126 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #42129 @dirrao\r\n - [x] #42137 @potiuk\r\n - [x] #42280 @vincbeck\r\n - [x] #42285 @ferruzzi\r\n - [ ] #42343 @uranusjr\r\n - [ ] #42404 @sunank200\r\n - [ ] #42436 @uranusjr\r\n - [ ] #42548 @dstandish\r\n - [x] #42579 @Lee-W\r\n - [ ] #42640 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #42647 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #42658 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #42660 @dirrao\r\n - [x] #42766 @jscheffl\r\n - [ ] #42776 @dirrao\r\n - [ ] #43564 @kaxil\r\n - [ ] #43067 @dstandish\r\n - [ ] #43073 @Lee-W\r\n - [x] #43096 @vincbeck\r\n - [ ] #43102 @bugraoz93\r\n - [ ] #43183 @dstandish\r\n - [x] #43289 @kaxil\r\n - [ ] #43291 @kaxil\r\n - [x] #44741 @shahar1\r\n - [x] #43490 @kaxil\r\n - [x] #43530 @kaxil\r\n - [x] #43533 @kaxil\r\n - [x] #43562 @kaxil\r\n - [x] #43568 @potiuk\r\n - [x] #43611 @jscheffl\r\n - [x] #43612 @jscheffl\r\n - [x] #43774 @Lee-W\r\n - [ ] #43902 @sunank200\r\n - [ ] #43915 @uranusjr\r\n - [ ] #43943 @ashb\r\n - [ ] #43949 @ephraimbuddy\r\n - [x] #43975 @kaxil\r\n - [ ] #44080 @jedcunningham\r\n - [x] #44475 @Lee-W\r\n - [x] #44533 @vatsrahul1001\r\n - [ ] #44706 @jedcunningham\r\n - [x] #44820 @kaxil\r\n - [ ] #45065 @jedcunningham\r\n - [x] #45530 @jscheffl\r\n - [ ] #45694 @kaxil\r\n - [ ] #43551 @ashb\r\n - [x] #45009 @vincbeck\r\n - [x] #44378 @Lee-W\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
