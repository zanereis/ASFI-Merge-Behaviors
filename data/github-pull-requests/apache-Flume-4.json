of the main security concerns regarding Flume is that currently passwords can only be set in plain text in the config file. I have a proof-of-concept to overcome this limitation with an extensible password provider.\r\n\r\nThe core of the solution is the `PasswordProvider` interface which has a default implementation (`PlainTextPasswordProvider`) which returns the value of the given key, thus taking care of backwards compatibility.\r\nThe other implementation is the `ExternalProcessPasswordProvider` which executes the configured command and returns its output.\r\n\r\nUsage example can be seen in the `AvroSource` (see the 2nd commit of this PR):\r\n\r\n``` diff\r\n- keystorePassword = context.getString(KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_KEY);\r\n+ keystorePassword = PasswordConfigurator.getPassword(context, KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_KEY);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example configuration to use the `ExternalProcessPasswordProvider`:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\na.sources.avro.keystore-password.passwordProviderClass=org.apache.flume.conf.ExternalProcessPasswordProvider\r\na.sources.avro.keystore-password.command=get_avro_keystore_password.sh\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example configuration with no `passwordProviderClass` set:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\na.sources.avro.keystore-password=SecretPassword\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs no `passwordProviderClass` is set in this example the default `PlainTextPasswordProvider` is used which returns the value of `a.sources.avro.keystore-password`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_Note: this is still a work in progress, I wanted to sketch up my idea. Any questions/comments/suggestions are more than

Kafka Source sets some header fields - especially \"topic\" - this leads to unexpected behavior in combination with the Kafka Sink => The messages will be consumed and produced again into that topic until the agent will be shut down.\n\nThe Kafka Sink determines the topic to which the event should be produced to based on a header field \"topic\" and overwrites the configuration of the sink.\nTo (nearly) fix that there are multiple options:\n- update the documentation - done with this PR\n- explicitly allow topic overriding at the kafka sink via a flag\n- write the source topic into another

see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLUME-2885.  Currently, the SyslogUDPSource truncates messages > 2K.  With this fix, the default behavior remains the same (2K is used for the buffer size), but if a user specifies a value for datagramSize in the flume configuration, then that size is used instead.  If we want to use AdaptiveReceiveBufferSizePredictor to avoid allocating buffers that are larger than necessary, 'someone' is going to have to develop a more comprehensive fix.  This at least allows for udp syslog users with messages larger than 2K to process their messages without truncation.\n\nI have deployed this fix in two environments where syslog messages can be larger than 2K, and it works as expected.\n","created_at":"2016-03-15T20:59:05Z","updated_at":"2019-04-29T10:18:13Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ac10d0a909f3f0e3b291ee38836c20ad3163799b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/45/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/45/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/45/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/statuses/8efafda2ac7798f3df26d4de309fa9d9d6c81348","head":{"label":"ryanpersaud:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"8efafda2ac7798f3df26d4de309fa9d9d6c81348","user":{"login":"ryanpersaud","id":3010742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTA3NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3010742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanpersaud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53971764,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1Mzk3MTc2NA==","name":"flume","full_name":"ryanpersaud/flume","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ryanpersaud","id":3010742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTA3NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3010742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanpersaud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpersaud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ryanpersaud/flume","description":"Mirror

support `maxHistory` feature (i.e. to delete older files) I had to be able to predict file names. I introduced new required property for `RollingFileSink` called `fileName`. This is the only backwards incompatible change from end users point of view. I have also made a couple of backwards incompatible changes to `PathManager` class. However `PathManager` class is not being used by any class other than `RollingFileSink` class.\n\nI am open to rewrite some of the changes if people think refactoring will cause any

ran into an issue where some of the raw data going into ElasticSearch was malformed (fields didn't match the data mapping), which ES rejected as part of the bulk insert. The Flume ES sink currently handles this by just sending the record over and over (hoping that maybe ES will just accept it later). Unfortunately, this creates a LOT of log traffic in ES default log settings AND it backed up our flume channel, because the data doesn't getting any better by blindly retrying it.\n\nThis patch allows users to choose between 3 options on what to do when bulk insert errors occur:\n1) retry until it somehow magically works (current default within apache flume)\n2) log the error message, then drop it\n3) drop it silently.\n\nIn our case, we just want to drop it, because losing a few records is worth it to keep our data flows moving. However, it would be better to have a more advanced option that can account for times when the ES server is down. Unfortunately, the ES client API doesn't allow for this flexibility to know the type of error, so this was the best option available at the time.\n","created_at":"2015-11-22T19:31:58Z","updated_at":"2022-10-08T04:08:46Z","closed_at":"2022-10-08T04:08:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a9a02532854974d47b0f974c2166da5dd39506b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/28/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/28/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/28/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/statuses/23a4f129c8ea9cb80585280ffbd04426bfba0d54","head":{"label":"milleka2:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"23a4f129c8ea9cb80585280ffbd04426bfba0d54","user":{"login":"milleka2","id":15148165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTQ4MTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15148165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2","html_url":"https://github.com/milleka2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44343497,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDM0MzQ5Nw==","name":"flume","full_name":"milleka2/flume","private":false,"owner":{"login":"milleka2","id":15148165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTQ4MTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15148165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2","html_url":"https://github.com/milleka2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleka2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/milleka2/flume","description":"Mirror

configuration\n2. run some time to let such deliver data from source to sink destination e.g elastic search\n3. change the conf configuration and make the sink node to be some wrong address and then\n    it would show connection refused for the sink \n4.  delivering  data to be continue as usual like 2nd step for some time\n5.  recovery the sink address to the be right one and watch whether the whole flow could be recovered as usual. and you will get the stack trace as above.\n\nBy the way, I don't know why it continue to show the nullpointerException by creating the createTransaction while recovering.  \n\nhope flume team could pay more attention to the stability of channel e.s.p for the SpillableMemoryChannel one and better improve the exception

patch allows third-party to developers extend HttpSource behavior easily, without having to reimplement the whole thing.\n\nMore specifically:\n- Adds an hook to customize `org.mortbay.jetty.servlet.Context`.\n- Delegates the HttpServlet instance creation to a protected factory method.\n- Changes FlumeHttpServlet visibility to `protected`, to let third party developers extend from it.\n- Adds an hook in `FlumeHTTPServlet` to customize `HttpServletResponse` before it is flushed.\n\nWe developed this patch because we had to add a custom servlet filter to the Jetty context.\n\nHaving this patch applied, a third-party developer could easily extend HttpSource like this:\n\n```\npublic class CustomHTTPSource extends HTTPSource {\n\n    @Override\n    protected void customizeServletContext(Context context) {\n        super.customizeServletContext(context);\n\n        context.addFilter(MyCustomHttpServletFilter.class,\"/*\",0);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected HttpServlet getServlet() {\n        return new KeedioFlumeHTTPServlet();\n    }\n\n    protected class KeedioFlumeHTTPServlet extends FlumeHTTPServlet{\n        @Override\n        protected void customizeServletResponse(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {\n            super.customizeServletResponse(request, response);\n\n            response.addHeader(\"Accept-Encoding\",\"...\");\n        }\n    }\n} \n```\n","created_at":"2015-05-29T07:52:52Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T12:18:41Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f12be1f5b73bb27bddf1806ec78ea52878b1ff1c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/18/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/18/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/18/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/statuses/9484a5fdd5f47ef2d4a2f900120a232b8737fe65","head":{"label":"keedio:customizable_httpsource","ref":"customizable_httpsource","sha":"9484a5fdd5f47ef2d4a2f900120a232b8737fe65","user":{"login":"keedio","id":10127317,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEwMTI3MzE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10127317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio","html_url":"https://github.com/keedio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":36486101,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjQ4NjEwMQ==","name":"flume","full_name":"keedio/flume","private":false,"owner":{"login":"keedio","id":10127317,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEwMTI3MzE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10127317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio","html_url":"https://github.com/keedio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keedio/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/keedio/flume","description":"Mirror
