the bug where the heartbeat is not sent when a newly created consumer is immediately closed.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a heartbeat request in flight and the consumer is then closed. In the current code, the `HeartbeatRequestManager` does not correctly send the closing heartbeat because a previous heartbeat request is still in flight. However, the closing heartbeat is only sent once, so in this situation, the broker will not know that the consumer has left the consumer group until the consumer's heartbeat times out. \r\nThis situation causes the broker to wait until the consumer's heartbeat times out before triggering a consumer group rebalance, which in turn affects message consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

if a connector generates the same set of task configs as the set that already exists in the config topic, then this new set of task configs is not written to the config topic, and the connector's tasks are not (immediately*) restarted.\r\n\r\nThis is intentional behavior to prevent infinite rebalance loops when using eager rebalancing, and most of the time it comes with no drawbacks. However, if the runtime-controlled properties for a connector (such as its key/value/header converters, or Kafka client overrides) are modified, then this behavior can cause the updates to not be applied (immediately*) to the connector's tasks.\r\n\r\nIn order to address this, we forcibly rewrite task configs to the config topic when we detect a change in the connector config, even if they are identical to the existing task configs. Changes to the connector config are tracked by taking a hash of the connector config and including it in the config topic when writing task configs.\r\n\r\nIf no hash has been written to the config topic yet, then we do not compare hashes. This is done in order to prevent upgrades to newer workers from causing all tasks on the cluster to be immediately restarted.\r\n\r\nAs a final note, this bug should not be very prevalent in the Kafka Connect ecosystem, since most connectors will unintentionally propagate changes in runtime-controlled properties to their tasks. This is because the classic idiom for connectors is to track the properties provided in [Connector::start](https://kafka.apache.org/37/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/connector/Connector.html#start(java.util.Map)) and use either an identical clone or a slightly-modified copy of those properties in the return value of [Connector::taskConfigs](https://kafka.apache.org/37/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/connector/Connector.html#taskConfigs(int)).\r\n\r\n\\* - Tasks can be restarted later on as a result of workers joining/leaving the cluster, users manually triggering restarts via the REST API, or other causes.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [

introduces share groups to go alongside consumer groups. Both kinds of group use server-side assignors but it is unlikely that a single assignor class would be suitable for both. As a result, the KIP introduces specific interfaces for consumer group and share group partition assignors.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces only the consumer group interface, `o.a.k.coordinator.group.assignor.ConsumerGroupPartitionAssignor`. The share group interface will come in a later release. The existing implementations of the general `PartitionAssignor` interface have been changed to implement `ConsumerGroupPartitionAssignor` instead and all other code changes are just propagating the change throughout the codebase.\r\n\r\nNote that the code in the group coordinator that actually calculates assignments uses the general `PartitionAssignor` interface so that it can be used with both kinds of group, even though the assignors themselves are specific.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

exception thrown while closing the client instances in `IntegrationTestHarness::tearDown` may result in\r\n`KafkaServerTestHarness::tearDown` not being invoked. This would result in thread leaks of the broker and controller threads spawned in the failing test.\r\n\r\nAn example of this is the [CI\r\nrun](https://ci-builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/Kafka%2Fkafka-pr/detail/PR-15994/1/tests) for #15994 where\r\n`Build / JDK 8 and Scala 2.12 / testCoordinatorFailover(String, String).quorum=kraft+kip848.groupProtocol=consumer – kafka.api.PlaintextConsumerTest` failing results in `consumers.foreach(_.close(Duration.ZERO))` in `IntegrationTestHarness::tearDown` throwing an exception.\r\n\r\nA side effect of this is it poisons Gradle test runner JVM and prevents tests in other unrelated classes from executing as `@BeforeAll` check in QuorumTestHarness would cause them to fail immediately.\r\n\r\nThis PR encloses the client closure in try-finally to ensure `KafkaServerTestHarness::tearDown` is always invoked.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

[A patch for KAFKA-15046](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/14242) got rid of `fsync` on `LeaderEpochFileCache#truncateFromStart/End` for performance reason, but it turned out this could cause corrupted leader-epoch checkpoint file on ungraceful OS shutdown\r\n  * i.e. OS shuts down in the middle when kernel is writing dirty pages back to the device\r\n- To address this problem, this PR makes below changes:\r\n  * Revert `LeaderEpochCheckpoint#write` to always fsync\r\n  * `truncateFromStart/End` now call `LeaderEpochCheckpoint#write` asynchronously on scheduler thread\r\n      - Why we still need to call `LeaderEpochCheckpoint#write`? => To prevent checkpoint file grows indefinitely as leader epoch increments\r\n      - Why async? => To avoid causing performance issue which #14242 addressed\r\n  * `UnifiedLog#maybeCreateLeaderEpochCache` now loads epoch entries from checkpoint file only when current cache is absent\r\n      - This is to prevent potentially-stale (because

KRaft replicas to send requests to any node (Node) not just the nodes configured in the controller.quorum.voters property. This flexibility is needed so KRaft can implement the controller.quorum.voters configuration, send request to the dynamically changing set of voters and send request to the leader endpoint (Node) discovered through the KRaft RPCs (specially BeginQuorumEpoch request and Fetch response).\r\n\r\nThis was achieved by changing the RequestManager API to accept Node instead of just the replica ID. Internally, the request manager tracks connection state using the Node.idString method to match the connection management used by NetworkClient.\r\n\r\nThe API for RequestManager is also changed so that the ConnectState class is not exposed in the API. This allows the request manager to reclaim heap memory for any connection that is ready.\r\n\r\nThe NetworkChannel was updated to receive the endpoint information (Node) through the outbound raft request (RaftRequent.Outbound). This makes the network channel more flexible as it doesn't need to be configured with the list of all possible endpoints. RaftRequest.Outbound and RaftResponse.Inbound were updated to include the remote node instead of just the remote id.\r\n\r\nThe follower state tracked by KRaft replicas was updated to include both the leader id and the leader's endpoint (Node). In this comment the node value is computed from the set of voters. In future commit this will be updated so that it is sent through KRaft RPCs. For example BeginQuorumEpoch request and Fetch response.\r\n\r\nSupport for configuring controller.quorum.bootstrap.servers was added. This includes changes to KafkaConfig, QuorumConfig, etc. All of the tests using QuorumTestHarness were changed to use the controller.quorum.bootstrap.servers instead of the controller.quorum.voters for the broker configuration. Finally, the node id for the bootstrap server will be decreasing negative numbers starting with -2.\r\n \r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-17T16:53:02Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T21:24:48Z","closed_at":"2024-06-03T21:24:48Z","merged_at":"2024-06-03T21:24:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"459da4795a511f6933e940fcf105a824bd9e589c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6787634831,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABlJMWjw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-853","name":"KIP-853","color":"D00CA6","default":false,"description":"KRaft

test shouldCloseAllTaskProducersOnCloseIfEosEnabled() in StreamThreadTest is flaky with a concurrent modification exception. The concurrent modification exception is caused by the test itself because it starts a stream thread and at the same time the thread that executes the test calls methods on the stream thread. The stream thread was not designed for such a concurrency.\r\nThe tests verifies that under EOS the streams producer are closed during shutdown. Actually the test is not needed since we already have a test that verifies that when the stream thread shuts down also the task manager shuts down and for the tasks manager we have tests that verify that the producers are closed when the task manager shuts down.\r\n\r\nThis commit verifies that those tests are run under EOS and ALOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

performance testing we observed that calculating the unassigned partitions by first initializing the set with all of the topic partitions within the Uniform assignor is a costly process, this can be improved by using a reverse lookup map between topicIdPartition and the member.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the following:\r\n\r\n1.  A new map to the consumer group state called **partitionAssignments** which is a reverse lookup map from each partition to the member it is assigned to. This map is updated every time the target assignment is updated.\r\n2. A new interface called GroupSpec which is implemented by the existing assignmentSpec.\r\n3. The GroupSpec interface contains a new method called isPartitionAssigned.\r\n\r\nThe most performance improvements should be noticeable in the Uniform Optimized Assignment

weren't enabling discoverBrokerVersions to check the supported versions in the AddPartitionsToTxnManager. This means that any verification request (or any AddPartitionsToTxnRequest version) from a newer broker would fail when sending to an older broker. \r\n\r\nThe bulk of this change is adding additional transactions system tests for old versions. \r\nOne test upgrades the cluster completely. This didn't catch the issue but could be useful.\r\n\r\nThe other test forces a new broker to send a verification request to an older one. Without the discoverBrokerVersions change, all tests between mixed brokers failed. (We introduced a new request version in 3.8 -- which is a separate version from the one that caused the bug for 3.5 -> 3.6) With the addition, the tests all passed. \r\n\r\nI also manually ran a test for 3.5 -> 3.6 since the issue there was slightly different and was caused by the unstableLatestVersion flag being enabled. This change should fix this as well. 👍 \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n-

have discovered during large scale performance tests that the current write path of the new coordinator does not scale well. The issue is that each write operation writes synchronously from the coordinator threads. Coalescing records into bigger batches helps drastically because it amortizes the cost of writes. Aligning the batches with the snapshots of the timelines data structures also reduces the number of in-flight snapshots.\r\n\r\nThis patch is the first of a series of patches that will bring records coalescing into the coordinator runtime. As a first step, we had to rework the PartitionWriter interface and move the logic to build MemoryRecords from it to the CoordinatorRuntime. The main changes are in these two classes. The others are related mechanical changes.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

client telemetry is configured in a cluster, Kafka producers and consumers push metrics to the brokers periodically. There is a special push of metrics that occurs when the client is terminating. A state machine in the client telemetry reporter controls its behaviour in different states.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when a client was terminating, it was attempting an invalid state transition from TERMINATING_PUSH_IN_PROGRESS to PUSH_NEEDED when it receives a response to a PushTelemetry RPC. This was essentially harmless because the state transition did not occur but it did cause unsightly log lines to be generated. This PR performs a check for the terminating states when receiving the response and simply remains in the current state.\r\n\r\nI added a test to validate the state management in this case. Actually, the test passes before the code change in the PR, but with unsightly log lines.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n-

patch fixes two issues with IncrementalAlterConfigs and the ZK migration. First, it changes the handling of IncrementalAlterConfigs to check if the controller is ZK vs KRaft and only forward for KRaft. Second, it adds a check in KafkaZkClient#setOrCreateEntityConfigs to ensure a ZK broker is not directly modifying configs in ZK if there is a KRaft controller. This closes the race condition between KRaft taking over as the active controller and the ZK brokers learning about this.\r\n\r\n*Forwarding*\r\n\r\nDuring the ZK migration, there is a time when the ZK brokers are running with migrations enabled, but KRaft has yet to take over as the controller. Prior to KRaft taking over as the controller, the ZK brokers in migration mode were unconditionally forwarding IncrementalAlterConfigs (IAC) to the ZK controller. This works for some config types, but breaks when setting BROKER and BROKER_LOGGER configs for a specific broker. The behavior in KafkaApis for IAC was to always forward if the forwarding manager was defined. Since ZK brokers in migration mode have forwarding enabled, the forwarding would happen, and the special logic for BROKER and BROKER_LOGGER would be missed, causing the request to fail.\r\n\r\nWith this fix, the IAC handler will check if the controller is KRaft or ZK and only forward for KRaft.\r\n\r\n*Protected ZK Writes*\r\n\r\nAs part of KIP-500, we moved most (but not all) ZK mutations to the ZK controller. One of the things we did not move fully to the controller was entity configs. This is because there was some special logic that needed to run on the broker for certain config updates. If a broker-specific config was set, AdminClient would route the request to the proper broker. In KRaft, we have a different mechanism for handling broker-specific config updates.\r\n\r\nLeaving this ZK update on the broker side would be okay if we were guarding writes on the controller epoch, but it turns out KafkaZkClient#setOrCreateEntityConfigs does unprotected \"last writer wins\" updates to ZK. This means a ZK broker could update the contents of ZK after the metadata had been migrated to KRaft. No good! To fix this, this patch adds a check on the controller epoch to KafkaZkClient#setOrCreateEntityConfigs but also adds logic to fail the update if the controller is a KRaft controller.\r\n\r\nThe new logic in setOrCreateEntityConfigs adds STALE_CONTROLLER_EPOCH as a new exception that can be thrown while updating configs.\r\n\r\nReviewers:  Luke Chen <showuon@gmail.com>, Akhilesh Chaganti

#15837, we introduced the change to allow calling the WriteTxnMarkers API with AlterCluster permissions. This PR proposes 2 enhancements:\r\n\r\n- When a WriteTxnMarkers request is received, it is first authorized against the alter cluster permission. If the user does not have this permission, a 'deny' will be logged. However, if the user does have the cluster action permission, the request will be successfully authorized.  Don't log the first deny to avoid confusion.\r\n- Add a `WriteTxnMarkersRequest` to be called from the test `testAuthorizationWithTopicExisting`, so that the request can be exercised and verified with both possible permissions.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

doing alter replica logDirs, we'll create a future log and pause log cleaning for the partition( [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/643db430a707479c9e87eec1ad67e1d4f43c9268/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/ReplicaManager.scala#L1200)). And this log cleaning pausing will resume after alter replica logDirs completes ([here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/643db430a707479c9e87eec1ad67e1d4f43c9268/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/LogManager.scala#L1254)). And when in the resuming log cleaning, we'll decrement 1 for the LogCleaningPaused count. Once the count reached 0, the cleaning pause is really resuming. ([here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/643db430a707479c9e87eec1ad67e1d4f43c9268/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/LogCleanerManager.scala#L310)). For more explanation about the logCleaningPaused state can check [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/643db430a707479c9e87eec1ad67e1d4f43c9268/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/LogCleanerManager.scala#L55).\r\n\r\n But, there's still one factor that could increase the LogCleaningPaused count: leadership change ([here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/643db430a707479c9e87eec1ad67e1d4f43c9268/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/ReplicaManager.scala#L2126)). When there's a leadership change, we'll check if there's a future log in this partition, if so, we'll create future log and pauseCleaning (LogCleaningPaused count + 1). So, if during the alter replica logDirs:\r\n\r\n    1. alter replica logDirs for tp0 triggered (LogCleaningPaused count = 1)\r\n    2. tp0 leadership changed (LogCleaningPaused count = 2)\r\n    3. alter replica logDirs completes, resuming logCleaning (LogCleaningPaused count = 1)\r\n    4. LogCleaning keeps paused because the count is always >  0\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by only abortAndPauseCleaning when future log is not existed. We did the same check in `alterReplicaLogDirs`. So this change can make sure there's only 1 `abortAndPauseCleaning` for either `abortAndPauseCleaning` or `maybeAddLogDirFetchers`. Tests also added.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

use topicIdPartition as the key for each RLM task. After supporting JBOD feature, it will cause highestOffsetInRemoteStorage in log not updated after logDir alter completion. The reproducing flow is like this:\r\n\r\n   1. tp-0 locating in dirA is the leader of the partition\r\n   2. tp-0 is altering logDir to dirB\r\n   3. tp-0 is copying segments to remote storage (note: the log in dirA)\r\n   4. The logDir altering for tp-0 is completed\r\n   5. `remoteLogManager#onLeadershipChange` is invoked, `copiedOffsetOption` is reset to Optional.empty()\r\n   6. The copying segments to remote storage in step 3 for tp-0 is completed, updating `copiedOffsetOption` to new offset, as well as the `log#highestOffsetInRemoteStorage`. (note: the log in dirA)\r\n   7. In the next run of RLMTask, the log will be the one in target dir (dirB), and the `log#highestOffsetInRemoteStorage` (dirB) will be the default value (-1), which will block the log cleanup operation.\r\n\r\n This PR makes sure after log dir changed, the RLMTask state will be reset. Also adding a test for the above scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build
