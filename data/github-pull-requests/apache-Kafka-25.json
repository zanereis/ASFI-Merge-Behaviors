About\r\nImplemented release acquired records functionality in SharePartition. This functionality is used when a share session gets closed, hence all the acquired records should either move to `AVAILABLE` or `ARCHIVED` state. Implemented the following functions -\r\n\r\n1. `releaseAcquiredRecords` - This function is executed when the acquisition lock timeout is reached. The function releases the acquired records.\r\n2. `releaseAcquiredRecordsForCompleteBatch` - Function which releases acquired records maintained at a batch level.\r\n3. `releaseAcquiredRecordsForPerOffsetBatch` - Function which releases acquired records maintained at an offset level.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAdded unit tests to cover the new functionality added.","created_at":"2024-06-24T05:23:34Z","updated_at":"2025-01-10T20:16:33Z","closed_at":"2024-06-27T10:03:46Z","merged_at":"2024-06-27T10:03:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"49e9bd4a5ba055b7d6e9d166ca87b75e75f738fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6979675393,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABoAVlAQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-932","name":"KIP-932","color":"DA462F","default":false,"description":"Queues

`PcollectionsImmutableMap` in order to get better read performance.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-22T18:47:18Z","updated_at":"2025-02-05T03:36:56Z","closed_at":"2025-02-05T03:36:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":970614414,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzA2MTQ0MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/performance","name":"performance","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

part of KIP-584, brokers expose a range of supported versions for each feature. For example, metadata.version might be supported from 1 to 21. (Note that feature level ranges are always inclusive, so this would include both level 1 and 21.)\r\n\r\nThese supported ranges are supposed to be able to include 0. For example, it should be possible for a broker to support a kraft.version between 0 and 1. However, in older software versions, there is an assertion in org.apache.kafka.common.feature.SupportedVersionRange that prevents this. This causes problems when the older software attempts to deserialize an ApiVersionsResponse containing such a range.\r\n\r\nIn order to resolve this dilemma, this PR bumps the version of ApiVersionsRequest from 3 to 4. Clients which send v4 promise to be able to handle ranges including 0. Clients which send v3 will not be exposed to these ranges. The feature will show up as having a minimum version of 1 instead. This work is part\r\nof KIP-1022.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, this PR also introduces a new version of BrokerRegistrationRequest, and specifies that the\r\nolder versions of that RPC cannot handle supported version ranges including 0. Therefore, 0 is translated to 1 in the older requests.","created_at":"2024-06-21T22:17:28Z","updated_at":"2024-09-09T18:31:58Z","closed_at":"2024-07-10T23:10:26Z","merged_at":"2024-07-10T23:10:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"ede289db93f6d191319ec03af69542b44be34953","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16421/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16421/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/16421/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/f4bd3ccfe123100431bbad0610f52b37c1ab6b9a","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-17011","ref":"KAFKA-17011","sha":"f4bd3ccfe123100431bbad0610f52b37c1ab6b9a","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

description is [KAFKA-10840](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10840).\r\n\r\nThe implication of this behaviour is that users of Producer client never fail and keep retrying. This is true for connect for example where `max.block.ms` is set to Long.MAX_VALUE and in environments where the value can't be reduced, this causes confusion to users (connect task would report status as `RUNNING` but the underneath producer would keep retrying and failing). \r\n\r\nThis PR throws propagates the Authentication failures instead of wrapping them in IOException as was being done previously. \r\n\r\nStacktrace for reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-04-26 13:27:58,226] WARN [connector|task-0] [Producer clientId=connector-producer-xxx] Bootstrap broker xxx:9093 (id: -1 rack:

About\r\nImplemented acquisition lock timeout functionality in SharePartition. Implemented the following functions - \r\n1. `releaseAcquisitionLockOnTimeout` - This function is executed when the acquisition lock timeout is reached. The function releases the acquired records.\r\n2. `releaseAcquisitionLockOnTimeoutForCompleteBatch` - Function which releases acquired records due to acquisition lock timeout maintained at a batch level.\r\n3. `releaseAcquisitionLockOnTimeoutForPerOffsetBatch` - Function which releases acquired records due to acquisition lock timeout maintained at an offset level.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAdded

a write operation does not have any records, the coordinator runtime checked whether the state machine is caught-up to decide whether the operation should wait until the state machine is committed up to the operation point or the operation should be completed. The current implementation assumes that there will always be a pending write operation waiting in the deferred queue when the state machine is not fully caught-up yet. This is true except when the state machine is just loaded and not caught-up yet.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue by always comparing the last written offset and the last committed offset.\r\n\r\n###

to the PMD code smell analysis \"LooseCoupling\" and \"ControlStatementBraces\"\r\n\r\nExcessive coupling to implementation types (e.g., HashSet) limits your ability to use alternate implementations in the future as requirements change. Whenever available, declare variables and parameters using a more general type (e.g, Set).\r\n\r\nEnforce a policy for braces on control statements. It is recommended to use braces on ‘if … else’ statements and loop statements, even if they are optional. This usually makes the code clearer, and helps prepare the future when you need to add another statement. That said, this rule lets you control which statements are required to have braces via properties.","created_at":"2024-06-17T03:42:38Z","updated_at":"2025-02-05T03:36:50Z","closed_at":"2025-02-05T03:36:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d5782354a222360bfb13c5c372234fa5d405503d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

StandardAuthorizer in Kraft mode is defining a KafkaPrincpal as type=User and a name, and a special wildcard eventually.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with this solution is that we can't define ACL by group of KafkaPrincipal.\r\n\r\nThere is a way for the moment to do so by defining RULE to rewrite the KafkaPrincipal name field, BUT, to introduce this way the notion of group, you have to set rules which will make you loose the uniq part of the KafkaPrincipal name of the connected client.\r\n\r\nThe concept here, in the StandardAuthorizer of Kafka Kraft, is to add  the management of KafkaPrincipal type:\r\n\r\n    Regex\r\n    StartsWith\r\n    EndsWith\r\n    Contains\r\n    (User is still available and keep working as before to avoid any regression/issue with current configurations)\r\n\r\nThis would be done in the StandardAcl class of metadata/authorizer, and the findresult method of StandardAuthorizerData will delegate the match to the StandardAcl class (for performance reason: precompile regex in ACL).\r\n\r\n*I added tests in metadat, and run ./gradlew test from kafak:trunk and my fork: no more failed test on my branch than kafka:trunk\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ x ] Verify design and implementation => thanks to spell checker in gradle process\r\n- [ x ] Verify test coverage and CI build status => adding few tests in metadata, an run gradlew test without more failed test thant kafka:trunk\r\n- [ x ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes) : added few lines in doc, no upgrade info as the previous behaviour should still work as before.\r\n\r\n[Link to the

observed some runs of the test suite caused CI pipelines to stall.\r\n\r\nA thread dump revealed that the test runner was blocked trying to read from a socket, while attempting to close the socket [[0]]. It turns out this is due to a bug in JDK which is very similar to [JDK-8274524](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8274524), but it affects the else branch of `SSLSocketImpl::bruteForceCloseInput` [[1]] which wasn't fixed in JDK-8274524.\r\n\r\nSince the blocking happens in a native call, the test runner's timeouts have no effect as the blocked test runner thread doesn't seem to respond to interrupts.\r\n\r\nAs a mitigation in Kafka's test suite, this change adds `SO_TIMEOUT` of 30 seconds to all the TLS sockets handled by `EchoServer`. The timeout is reasonably high for tests and a finite upper bound avoids infinite blocking of the test suite.\r\n\r\n[0]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13066427/timeout.log\r\n[1]:

integration test for the new TaskAssignor interface and public config. This test builds on top of the existing TaskAssignorIntegrationTest which simply checked the assignor configuration for the legacy task assignor and the old `internal.task.assignor.class` config. We extend it in a few ways:\r\n\r\n1. Add some missing configs (basically all the rack-aware stuff) to the validation of the assignor configuration\r\n2. Add two new tests which check the assignor configuration when plugging in a TaskAssignor via the new public `task.assignor.class` config in KIP-924: a simple test that verifies you can use the new StickyTaskAssignor and a more complex test that does some additional verification via a custom assignor implementation\r\n3. The custom assignor test covers all new features of the KIP-924 TaskAssignor, such as the ability to configure it, the post-assignment callback, and the ability to assign only a subset of tasks or even no tasks at all to a
