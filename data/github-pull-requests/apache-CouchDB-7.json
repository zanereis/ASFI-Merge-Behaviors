Note that this requires to change the way how stats are stored -- an approach similar to that of the view callback arguments was chosen, which features a map (#4394).\r\n\r\nThe change in the format also implies a potential incompatibility between different version of nodes, which may happen for mixed-version clusters.  This is handled by introducing an additional option for the view callback where the coordinator can request for the results in the new format and the old format is still recognized.  It helps to handle version differences automatically therefore no specific configuration option is required to control the migration.  Thanks @rnewson for the idea.\r\n\r\nThis is related to the covering indexes work and takes inspiration from earlier works of @mikerhodes , see #4410 and #4413 for the details.\r\n\r\nNote that slight increase in unit test coverage for `mango_execution_stats` due to the implicit testing via `mango_cursor_view`.  The only missing part is `incr_docs_examined/1` but that is not used from there, only from `mango_cursor_text` and `mango_cursor_nouveau` .\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ make eunit

original text  in the [documentation](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/maintenance/performance.html#document-s-id) said that something that takes 16 hex digits can be represented with just 4 digits (in an hypothetical base62 encoding).\r\n\r\nI believe that was a typo since 16 hex digits encode a 8-byte sequence that will require (8/3)*4 = 11 digits in base64 (without padding).\r\n\r\nSo I fixed the typo, and took the liberty of rephrasing it to be more clear, and reference to `base64url` encoding \r\ninstead of base62 (since it's a base64url is a well known encoding)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please

another field to the shard-level Mango execution statistics to keep track of the count of keys that were examined for the query.  Note that this required to change the way how stats are stored -- an approach similar to that of the view callback arguments was chosen, which features a map (#4394).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the changes in this pull request only add support for the receiver (coordinator) side to be able to parse messages of the updated format.  It will have to be deployed first so that we could start sending such messages and avoid crashes for mixed-version clusters.\r\n\r\nThis is related to the covering indexes work and takes inspiration from earlier works of @mikerhodes , see #4410 and #4413 for the details.\r\n\r\nNote that slight increase in unit test coverage for `mango_execution_stats` due to the implicit testing via `mango_cursor_view`.  The only missing part is `incr_docs_examined/1` but that is not used from there, only from `mango_cursor_text` and `mango_cursor_nouveau` .\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ make eunit

is a backport of https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4529 from main\r\n\r\nThe original commit message follows:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe main improvement is speeding up process lookup. This should result in improved latency for concurrent requests which quickly acquire and release couchjs processes. Testing with concurrent vdu and map/reduce calls showed a 1.6 -> 6x performance speedup [1].\r\n\r\nPreviously, couch_proc_manager linearly searched through all the processes and executed a custom callback function for each to match design doc IDs. Instead, use a separate ets table index for idle processes to avoid scanning assigned processes.\r\n\r\nUse a db tag in addition to a ddoc id to quickly find idle processes. This could improve performance, but if that's not the case, allow configuring the tagging scheme to use a db prefix only, or disable the scheme altogether.\r\n\r\nUse the new `map_get` ets select guard [2] to perform ddoc id lookups during the ets select traversal without a custom matcher callback.\r\n\r\nIn ordered ets tables use the partially bound key trick [3]. This helps skip scanning processes using a different query language altogether.\r\n\r\nWaiting clients used `os:timestamp/0` as a unique client identifier. It turns out, `os:timestamp/0` is not guaranteed to be unique and could result in some clients never getting a response. This bug was mostly likely the reason the \"fifo client order\" test had to be commented out. Fix the issue by using a newer monotonic timestamp function, and for uniqueness add the client's gen_server return tag at the end. Uncomment the previously commented out test so it can hopefully run again.\r\n\r\nWhen clients tag a previously untagged process, asynchronously replace the untagged process with a new process. This happens in the background and the client doesn't have to wait for it.\r\n\r\nWhen a ddoc tagged process cannot be found, before giving up, stop the oldest unused ddoc processes to allow spawning new fresh ones. To avoid doing a linear scan here, keep a separate `?IDLE_ACCESS` index with an ordered list of idle ddoc proceses sorted by their last usage time.\r\n\r\nWhen processes are returned to the pool, quickly respond to the client with an early return, instead of forcing them to wait until we re-insert the process back into the idle ets table. This should improve client latency.\r\n\r\nIf the waiting client list gets long enough, where it waits longer than the gen_server get_proc timeout, do not waste time assigning or spawning a new process for that client, since it already timed-out.\r\n\r\nWhen gathering stats, avoid making gen_server calls, at least for the total number of processes spawned metric. Table sizes can be easily computed with `ets:info(Table, size)` from outside the main process.\r\n\r\nIn addition to peformance improvements clean up the couch_proc_manager API by forcing all the calls to go through properly exported functions instead of doing direct gen_server calls.\r\n\r\nRemove `#proc_int{}` and use only `#proc{}`. The cast to a list/tuple between `#proc_int{}` and `#proc{}` was dangerous and it avoided the compiler checking that we're using the proper fields. Adding an extra field to the record resulted in mis-matched fields being assigned.\r\n\r\nTo simplify the code a bit, keep the per-language count in an ets table.

Everything else was mostly kept in ets tables anyway, so we're staying consistent with that general pattern.\r\n\r\nImprove test coverage and convert the tests to use the `?TDEF_FE` macro so there is

main improvement is speeding up process lookup. This should result in improved latency for concurrent requests which quickly acquire and release couchjs processes. Testing with concurrent vdu and map/reduce calls showed a 1.6 -> 6x performance speedup [1].\r\n\r\nPreviously, couch_proc_manager linearly searched through all the processes and executed a custom callback function for each to match design doc IDs. Instead, use a separate ets table index for idle processes to avoid scanning assigned processes.\r\n\r\nUse a db tag in addition to a ddoc id to quickly find idle processes. This could improve performance, but if that's not the case, allow configuring the tagging scheme to use a db prefix only, or disable the scheme altogether.\r\n\r\nUse the new `map_get` ets select guard [2] to perform ddoc id lookups during the ets select traversal without a custom matcher callback.\r\n\r\nIn ordered ets tables use the partially bound key trick [3]. This helps skip scanning processes using a different query language altogether.\r\n\r\nWaiting clients used `os:timestamp/0` as a unique client identifier. It turns out, `os:timestamp/0` is not guaranteed to be unique and could result in some clients never getting a response. This bug was mostly likely the reason the \"fifo client order\" test had to be commented out. Fix the issue by using a newer monotonic timestamp function, and for uniqueness add the client's gen_server return tag at the end. Uncomment the previously commented out test so it can hopefully run again.\r\n\r\nWhen clients tag a previously untagged process, asynchronously replace the untagged process with a new process. This happens in the background and the client doesn't have to wait for it.\r\n\r\nWhen a ddoc tagged process cannot be found, before giving up, stop the oldest unused ddoc processes to allow spawning new fresh ones. To avoid doing a linear scan here, keep a separate `?IDLE_ACCESS` index with an ordered list of idle ddoc proceses sorted by their last usage time.\r\n\r\nWhen processes are returned to the pool, quickly respond to the client with an early return, instead of forcing them to wait until we re-insert the process back into the idle ets table. This should improve client latency.\r\n\r\nIf the waiting client list gets long enough, where it waits longer than the gen_server get_proc timeout, do not waste time assigning or spawning a new process for that client, since it already timed-out.\r\n\r\nWhen gathering stats, avoid making gen_server calls, at least for the total number of processes spawned metric. Table sizes can be easily computed with `ets:info(Table, size)` from outside the main process.\r\n\r\nIn addition to peformance improvements clean up the couch_proc_manager API by forcing all the calls to go through properly exported functions instead of doing direct gen_server calls.\r\n\r\nRemove `#proc_int{}` and use only `#proc{}`. The cast to a list/tuple between `#proc_int{}` and `#proc{}` was dangerous and it avoided the compiler checking that we're using the proper fields. Adding an extra field to the record resulted in mis-matched fields being assigned.\r\n\r\nTo simplify the code a bit, keep the per-language count in an ets table. This helps not having to thread the old and updated state everywhere. Everything else was mostly kept in ets tables anyway, so we're staying consistent with that general pattern.\r\n\r\nImprove test coverage and convert the tests to use the `?TDEF_FE` macro so there is no need for the awkward `?_test(begin ... end)` construct.\r\n\r\n[1] https://gist.github.com/nickva/f088accc958f993235e465b9591e5fac\r\n[2] https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/match_spec.html\r\n[3]

Specifically:\r\n\r\n 1.

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\nUsing key and start/end_key in a different order will produce different responses when querying `_all_docs`.\r\nTo reduce confusion, add a key range check for `_all_docs`.\r\n\r\n- If direction=fwd, start_key > end_key throws an error\r\n- If direction=rev, start_key < end_key throws an error\r\n- Otherwise, return relevant responses\r\n\r\n**Previous behavior:**\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl -XPUT $DB/db\r\n$ curl -XPOST $DB/db/_bulk_docs -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"docs\": [{\"_id\": \"a\"},{\"_id\": \"b\"},{\"_id\": \"c\"}]}'\r\n\r\n$ curl $DB/db/_all_docs'?key=\"c\"&endkey=\"a\"'\r\n{\"total_rows\":3,\"offset\":2,\"rows\":[ ]}\r\n\r\n$ curl $DB/db/_all_docs'?key=\"c\"&endkey=\"a\"&descending=true'\r\n{\"total_rows\":3,\"offset\":0,\"rows\":[\r\n  {\"id\":\"c\",\"key\":\"c\",\"value\":{\"rev\":\"1-967a00dff5e02add41819138abb3284d\"}},\r\n  {\"id\":\"b\",\"key\":\"b\",\"value\":{\"rev\":\"1-967a00dff5e02add41819138abb3284d\"}},\r\n  {\"id\":\"a\",\"key\":\"a\",\"value\":{\"rev\":\"1-967a00dff5e02add41819138abb3284d\"}}\r\n]}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After the change:**\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl $DB/db/_all_docs'?key=\"c\"&endkey=\"a\"'\r\n{\"error\":\"query_parse_error\",\"reason\":\"No rows can match your key range, reverse your start_key and end_key or set descending=true\"}\r\n\r\n$ curl $DB/db/_all_docs'?key=\"c\"&endkey=\"a\"&descending=true'\r\n{\"total_rows\":3,\"offset\":0,\"rows\":[\r\n  {\"id\":\"c\",\"key\":\"c\",\"value\":{\"rev\":\"1-967a00dff5e02add41819138abb3284d\"}},\r\n

pull request aims to implement the first phase of the covering indexes work (_\"keys-only covering indexes\"_) as it was described in the corresponding RFC document by @mikerhodes, see #4410 and #4413 for the details.\r\n\r\nIdeally, end users should not notice any change in the behavior but speed-ups for certain kind of queries.  Performance results obtained by [k6](https://k6.io/) on my MacBook Pro 2021 M1 Max, with 10,000 documents, compared against `c5a7809f` with 3 nodes:\r\n\r\n- 1-field index covers the query:\r\n  - before: `min=0.59ms  max=498.29ms   p(95)=313.02ms  p(98)=357.44ms  p(99)=390.75ms`\r\n  - after: `min=0.53ms max=127.26ms   p(95)=33.15ms   p(98)=37.53ms   p(99)=39.99ms`\r\n- 2-field index covers the query:\r\n  - before: `min=19.68ms max=893.79ms   p(95)=674.84ms  p(98)=739.12ms  p(99)=774.02ms`\r\n  - after: `min=1.95ms max=163.22ms   p(95)=50.13ms   p(98)=57.11ms   p(99)=63.38ms`\r\n- generic case:\r\n  - before: `min=0.70ms  max=3786.70ms  p(95)=2733.86ms p(98)=3265.91ms p(99)=3452.13ms`\r\n  - after: `min=0.72ms max=3590.26ms  p(95)=2631.55ms p(98)=2777.04ms p(99)=2879.50ms`\r\n\r\nPlease find the details of the performance evaluation in [`pgj/couchdb-k6/mango/couchdb_4482`](https://github.com/pgj/couchdb-k6/tree/main/mango/couchdb_4482).\r\n\r\nUnit test

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis adds a number of additional _prometheus metrics to get closer to parity with the `_system` endpoint that is commonly scraped by monitoring tools.\r\n\r\nNamely:\r\n\r\n - `couchdb_erlang_message_queue_size{queue_name=<message queue name>}`\r\n - `couchdb_internal_replication_jobs`\r\n - `couchdb_membership{nodes=all_nodes|cluster_nodes}`\r\n\r\nThe following metric types are changed to `gauge` in the `_prometheus` endpoint to match prometheus semantics that assume counters are cumulative only:\r\n\r\n- `couchdb_open_databases`\r\n- `couchdb_couchdb_open_os_files`\r\n- `couchdb_httpd_clients_requesting_changes`\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make eunit apps=couch_prometheus`\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affect multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.  -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] Documentation changes were made in

sometimes throws an `InternalError` when exceeding memory limits, when normally we'd expect it to crash or exit with a non-0 exit code. Because we trap exceptions, and continue emitting rows, it is possible for users views to randomly miss indexed rows based on whether GC had run or not, other internal runtime state which may have been consuming more or less memory until that time.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the view continuing processing documents, and randomly dropping emitted rows, depending on memory pressure in the JS runtime at the time, choose to treat Internal errors as fatal.\r\n\r\nAfter an InternalError is raised we expect the process to exit just like it would during OOM.\r\n\r\nAdd a test to assert this happens.\r\n\r\nFix

This allows us to extend what metadata is introduced over time in such a way that parsing at the log/syslog level will not need further modifications for new data. This means we can easily introduce additional data logging around volume or IO operations or other statistics at a lower granularity than the doc level.\r\n\r\nIt could be argued that this data should be directly coupled with the underlying http log, and I offer two counterpoints:\r\n\r\n  1) currently `mango_crud:find/5` returns an accumulated response, rather than a request handle, so we lose the metadata generated inside `mango` when it passes back into the `chttpd` layer, hence `chttpd` no longer has the relevant stats to include in the log when we finally log the post http request entry in `chttpd`. We _could_ modify the relevant code paths to introduce a data structure containing both the response and metadata values allowing us to funnel data to be logged up from lower levels in the system than chttpd; I think this is potentially worthwhile, but I also think item 2) below makes this less of an immediate concern.\r\n\r\n  2) I believe strongly we need the ability to collect data about the overhead performed by a particular task and then log that data such that we can more clearly articulate what CouchDB is doing as a function of time. This is certainly incredibly important for http requests that generate load to understand expensive requests, but also just as important for background operations as we have some blind spots in the amount of `couch_btree:foldl` operations induced per operation, be it a view/_all_docs or a background job like compaction of view building. Therefore we have areas to generate these report logs where there's no existing http request context to hook into. Furthermore, I think it's worthwhile to be able to record stats along these lines on the RPC side rather than funneling all the data back to the coordinator to do the logging there.\r\n\r\nI do think there's merit to 1) above, however, I think 2) necessitates report logging outside of an http context so I'm not convinced we should do 1) as part of this PR. That said, feedback is welcome.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nThe current structure of this PR is functional and allows for a hybrid approach for the report logging such that the RFC5424 metadata can be introduced _along with_ an additional arbitrary string message afterwards. While working through the logic here, in practice, supporting the hybrid approach complicates the underlying logic in the codebase and also seems to complicate the ability for RFC5424 parsers to extract the metadata and parse the log entry. For example, here's a [RFC5424 parser Splunk plugin](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/978) I've been looking at and one of the caveats is:\r\n\r\n> The MSG section of the event, if it exists, is not parsed by this app.\r\n\r\nand a sample message from RFC5424 demonstrating structured metadata followed by a string `MSG`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n           <165>1 2003-10-11T22:14:15.003Z mymachine.example.com\r\n           evntslog - ID47 [exampleSDID@32473 iut=\"3\" eventSource=\r\n           \"Application\" eventID=\"1011\"] BOMAn application\r\n           event log entry...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it's a valid log entry to introduce structured metadata _and also_ follow that with an arbitrary log `MSG` string, but like I said this seems to complicate a lot of things both from a parsing standpoint and the logistics of short circuiting empty messages and format strings through `couch_log_formatter`. I'm inclined to remove this functionality, especially since it feels that in practice, the most useful thing here is logging the metadata block, rather than an additional `MSG` payload.\r\n\r\nI wanted to get broader feedback before going down that route of removing the additional MSG, so the PR is in the current form outlined above, but I've got an initial diff below to drop that functionality. This would also cleanup all the additional logic introduced by `couch_log:log/3 --> couch_log:log/5`, and so my preferred direction for this PR to go is to apply this diff and then drop out all support for metadata logging outside of a very specifically targeted `couch_log:report`.

are a few minor improvements:\r\n\r\n- Add more tests to check sandboxing resets, and that docs are \"frozen\".\r\n\r\n- Remove the extra `\\n` and `\"` around function body lines. Erlang can do multi-line binaries just fine. Mark the sections with `%erlfmt-ignore` so the formatter doesn't complain.\r\n\r\n- Generalize `should_create_sandbox` test to check for the `not defined` string only. Experimenting with QuickJS noticed that it uses single quotes around`'Object.foo' is not defined` and SM doesn't. So check for `not defined` part only as it's obvious enough what the check is about.\r\n\r\n- Make sure to return test procs back to the pool. Previously, none of the tests returned the processes back into the pool, and when the tests ended, they were forcibly killed which resulted in log noise that looked like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerl_child_setup: failed with error 32 on line 265\r\nerl_child_setup: failed with error 32 on line

Overview\r\n\r\nThe `/_node/_local/_prometheus` is a missing `TYPE` annotation for `couchdb_httpd_status_codes`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it contains no `HELP` annotations, which are useful when exploring the metrics, particularly where\r\nmetrics do not strictly match those returned by the `_stats` or `_system` endpoints.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the missing `TYPE` annotation and adds `HELP` annotations to all metrics. It also adds additional spacing between the metrics series, making it easier for humans to parse.\r\n\r\nThe spec for the prometheus text format is at https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/main/content/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats.md, for reference.\r\n\r\n## couch_prometheus_util:to_prom/3\r\n\r\n`couch_prometheus_util:to_prom/3` is replaced by `couch_prometheus_util:to_prom/4` which requires a description alongside the metric name and type.\r\n\r\n## couch_prometheus_util:couch_to_prom/3\r\n\r\n`couch_prometheus_util:couch_to_prom/3` now extracts the metrics description from the metric metadata returned by `couch_stats`.\r\n\r\nIn cases where there transformation of the `couch_stats` result, the description is explicitly specified to match the new metric series.\r\n\r\n[_prometheus output before](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/files/10960969/prometheus_before.txt)\r\n[_prometheus output after](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/files/10960980/prometheus_after.txt)\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nUnit tests are updated to expect the `# HELP` annotations alongside the `# TYPE` annotations for each metric.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affect multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.  -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works

Overview\r\n\r\n`couch_prometheus_util:counter_metric/1` is intended to add a `_total` suffix to the name of metrics with type `counter` if the name does not already end with `_total`.\r\n\r\nThe implementation was previously incorrect, resulting in the metric `couchdb_document_purges_total` being named as `couchdb_document_purges_total_total`.\r\n\r\nWhilst the `counter_metric` function is generic, in practice this only changes the name of `couchdb_document_purges_total_total` in the `_node/_local/_prometheus` endpoint response. Consumers of this metric via the prometheus endpoint will need to update their code accordingly.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThis adds basic eunit tests for the failure / success scenarios and fixes the implementation. As part of this, I've inlined the eunit tests for `couch_prometheus_util.erl` as this is the pattern used elsewhere in the CouchDB codebase and it allows us to test the counter_metric function without exporting it.\r\n\r\nTo verify, run:\r\n`make eunit apps=couch_prometheus`\r\n\r\nYou can also query then `/_node/_local/_prometheus` endpoint to observe the metric output.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affect multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.  -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ]

Overview\r\n\r\nThe `_node/_local/_prometheus` was returning duplicate rows for the following metrics:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncouchdb_erlang_memory_bytes\r\ncouchdb_erlang_gc_collections_total\r\ncouchdb_erlang_gc_words_reclaimed_total\r\ncouchdb_erlang_context_switches_total\r\ncouchdb_erlang_reductions_total\r\ncouchdb_erlang_processes\r\ncouchdb_erlang_process_limit\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrometheus will gracefully handle the duplication, picking the first entry only, but the duplication bloats the output and can cause some confusion when manually reading the response to get the list of metrics.\r\n\r\nThis fix is to remove a duplicate call to `get_vm_stats()` in the prometheus endpoint handler.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nI added a unit test for duplicate metrics in `couch_prometheus`. This fails prior to the fix and now passes, though my Erlang is likely a bit clunky!\r\n\r\nOne can also observe the output of `/_node/_local/_prometheus` before and after this change.\r\n\r\n##

are some document comments in `fabric` that point to the old CouchDB wiki.  The featured links are not working any more (possibly lost during the migration), although one could still find them e.g. through the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20161002083018/http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_view_API).  On Slack, @nickva suggested that including explicit links in the comments is not a good practice anyway, hence this proposal to remove completely.

reading the documentation, noticed a couple of problems with the HTML version, of which this change covers:\r\n\r\n- Parameter types for JSON objects are not uniform.  The type `json` could either ambigiously refer to objects or arrays and used randomly.\r\n- The `Content-Type` header for response descriptions is not always put in a list, though probably that is the right choice because there can be many.\r\n- Indentation of paragraphs and list items is off sometimes which causes rendering mistakes.\r\n- Formatting of JSON examples is not uniform by indentation.\r\n- Add a couple of missed markdown for names, such as operators, to make them stand out from the text for better readability.\r\n- Unify style: use colons for the sentences that introduce examples, end sentences with full stops, lose contractions, regularize elaboration of object details for index descriptions and definitions.\r\n- Fix the reference to views in design documents when talking about indexes.\r\n- Add link for `_find` at the section about the index selection.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-09T11:07:26Z","updated_at":"2023-03-10T17:39:25Z","closed_at":"2023-03-09T16:00:23Z","merged_at":"2023-03-09T16:00:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"edded961811282a010986cf8a31d01d8c2920cc0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4460/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4460/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4460/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/d889d117832cd6a4e41dea98798ece08a5cb9917","head":{"label":"pgj:docs/api-db-find-tweaks","ref":"docs/api-db-find-tweaks","sha":"d889d117832cd6a4e41dea98798ece08a5cb9917","user":{"login":"pgj","id":277835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzgzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj","html_url":"https://github.com/pgj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":589935401,"node_id":"R_kgDOIymzKQ","name":"couchdb","full_name":"pgj/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pgj","id":277835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzgzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj","html_url":"https://github.com/pgj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pgj/couchdb","description":"Seamless

adding a text index, Mango queries may not return documents that should match a selector that contains the `$regex` operator.  Steps to reproduce (thanks to @willholley), that are also captured in the integration tests:\r\n\r\n1. Create an empty database. \r\n2. Add a document:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{ \r\n    \"_id\": \"foo\",\r\n    \"currency\": \"HUF\",\r\n    \"location\": \"EUROPE\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Run a Mango query without indexes -- this should return the document above:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"selector\": {\r\n        \"currency\": {\r\n            \"$regex\": \"HUF\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Add a text index for `location`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"index\": {\r\n        \"fields\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"location\",\r\n                \"type\": \"string\"\r\n            }\r\n       ]\r\n   },\r\n   \"name\": \"location-text\",\r\n   \"type\": \"text\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Run the query once more -- this time, no documents are returned.\r\n\r\nThis is because the text index is chosen to answer the query even if it does not contain the field on which the `$regex` match should be run.  This is due to the permissive logic of the index selection where the fields with `$regex` in the selector are not cross-checked against the fields in the index.\r\n\r\nThe PR implements the necessary changes to ensure that text indexes are chosen more carefully and covers them with tests.  Note that this also means an increase in the unit test coverage of the related functions to be less dependent on a working Clouseau instance.  As an extra, it aims to improve the readability by introducing extra commentary (thanks to @mikerhodes) and type specifications.\r\n\r\nRandom stats on coverage, before:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ make

Overview\r\n\r\nWhile investigating issues in my deployment around logrotate I discovered the file logger last_check doesn't appear to be updated after init is called, this could result in maybe_reopen being called with every log write 30 seconds after init is called. The fix works as the documentation specifies, but I wasn't able to measure a meaningful performance harm from the previous functionality. Throwing it up in case it's desirable.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nWith the fix observe it can take up to 30 seconds from the last check before the log is recreated after deletion. Without the fix the log gets recreated much more quickly.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by
