Change Logs\r\n\r\nGlue has soft limit of 100k table versions. \r\nWith every table update new version is created. \r\nIn streaming scenarios we can hit 100k table versions quickly.\r\nUsers should be able to skip table archival when using glue meta sync. \r\n\r\nWhy this change is needed?\r\nIt's been asked many times in Hudi Slack, how to reduce no of glue table versions created. There is conditional hive sync, but it does not solve the problem fully. With .skipArchive users can reduce no. of table versions created even more.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAdded GLUE_SKIP_TABLE_ARCHIVE config, defaults to true.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium as there are no tests for glue sync but the change is not complex\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nconfig GLUE_SKIP_TABLE_ARCHIVE - defaults to true, controls

Change Logs\r\n\r\n[Glue partition indexes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/partition-indexes.html#partition-index-getpartitions) can faster partitions retrieval and thus glue based engines (athena, presto...). So far glue allows 3 indexes per tables and aws-sync does not yet provides this feature.\r\n\r\nW/O partition indexes:\r\n![athena-index2](https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/9535350/dfdd9115-6003-4c6f-ae39-59183551087f)\r\n\r\nW/ partition indexes:\r\n![athena-index1](https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/9535350/d45d19cd-0afa-4d6b-9b64-4c3385f9358d)\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nAter enabling : `hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.glue.partition_index_fields.enable=true` and set `hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.glue.partition_index_fields=version;version,event_date;event_date` \r\nwe get 3 indexes and the feature enabled:\r\n\r\n![partition_index_2023-05-19_22:26:24](https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/9535350/a10f690b-aa22-4ae5-ab6b-cd91df6fe424)\r\n\r\nThen after disabling: `hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.glue.partition_index_fields.enable=false`, the indexes are dropped and the feature disabled:\r\n\r\n![partition_index2_2023-05-19_22:29:34](https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/9535350/86e5985a-548f-4179-9e92-287ebca36fc6)\r\n\r\nBy default, when enabling partition indexes and not specifying the partitions, one index with all partition will be created.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1. the management of the partition indexes is done each time the last_commit is updated (so that users can decide to activate/deactivate indexing at will)\r\n2. Due to a limitation of glue indexing, multiples indexes will be created one at a time asynchroneously. As a result multiple hive_sync will be needed to create them.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\n`HoodieInternalWriteStatus` should mark failure with `totalErrorRecords` increment. Otherwise `BulkInsertWriterHelper#toWriteStatus` could not get the correct value of `totalErrorRecords` because the `totalErrorRecords` of write status comes from the `totalErrorRecords` of internal write status for `writeStatus.setTotalErrorRecords(internalWriteStatus.getTotalErrorRecords())`, which cause that `ClusteringCommitSink` could not rollback clustering when `ClusteringCommitEvent` has errors.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n`HoodieInternalWriteStatus` marks failure with `totalErrorRecords` increment for correct `totalErrorRecords`.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

current flows are as follows:\r\n\r\nfetch schema:\r\n- Fetch desired table schema in Avro format from schema registry\r\n- Get a respective dataset schema given desired table Avro schema\r\n- Convert respective dataset schema back to Avro schema to get an unified schema\r\n\r\ntransform input:\r\n- Consume Kafka via Spark Streaming and receive `RDD<GenericRecord>`\r\n- Rewrite the RDD to unified schema to resolve version differences to end up with desired schema where some fields get dropped and some datatypes get changed. Enum => String for example\r\n\t- We use a copy of the org.apache.hudi.avro.HoodieAvroUtils class to do the rewrite and require it to support aforementioned rewrite procedure\r\n\t- Hopefully we can make the changes in public repo, so we don't need to maintain a custom rewrite class\r\n- Convert `RDD<GenricRecord>` to `Dataset<Row>`\r\n\r\nThere are situations where we read input from S3 directly resulting in `Dataset<Row>` which needs to be backfilled to table, so maintaining control over the schema on application side is beneficial for us instead of it being inferred from raw data.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nRewrite to support enum => string conversion\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nno impact\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nSupport incremental read (both latest_state and cdc) for Spark SQL via table valued function.\r\nExample usage:\r\n```sql\r\nselect id, name, price, ts \r\nfrom hudi_table_changes('mytable', 'latest_state', 'beginInstantTime', 'endInstantTime');\r\n\r\nselect id, name, price, ts \r\nfrom hudi_table_changes('my/table/path', 'latest_state', 'beginInstantTime', 'endInstantTime');\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNew hudi_table_changes() function is added to Hudi Spark SQL Extension\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nadd documentation for hudi_table_changes() and hudi_table_changes_by_path() function:  \r\n- `hudi_table_changes('db.table', 'latest_state, 'earliest')` -> start from earliest available commit, end at latest available commit. \r\n- `hudi_table_changes('table', 'cdc', 'earliest', '202305160000')` -> start from earliest, end at 202305160000.  \r\n- `hudi_table_changes('table', 'latest_state | cdc', '202305150000', '202305160000')` -> start from 202305150000, end at 202305160000.\r\n- `hudi_table_changes('path/to/huditable',

checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-16T11:13:32Z","updated_at":"2023-11-30T21:11:17Z","closed_at":"2023-06-20T02:05:51Z","merged_at":"2023-06-20T02:05:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"243098c39afffd79d881c056282016a2732eaabc","assignee":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"YannByron","id":10036681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDM2Njgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10036681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron","html_url":"https://github.com/YannByron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719802999,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAyOTk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:major","name":"priority:major","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":"degraded

Change Logs\r\n\r\nBy default inline compaction is disabled for batch writes (spark datasource writes and soark-sql writes). But from a user exp standpoint, its better to enable it by default. So, if a user does not explicitly enable inline compaction w/ spark-datasource or spark-sql writes, inline compaction will be enabled. If user explicitly overwrites and disables, no overrides will happen. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproves out of the box user experience.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nProvides support for parquet native bloom filters to improve read performances. fixes #7117 \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAll hudi operations (bulk_insert, insert, upsert ...) will be able to write parquet bloom filters if configured within the application hadoop conf. The hudi reader already leverages the blooms if the predicates match the columns configured at write time.\r\n\r\nBloom indexes only works for COW tables since it needs parquet files and is unlikely to work with MOR logs files even configured to write  parquet format instead of avro.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nThe doc will be added a new guide, in the same maner of current [encryption page](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/encryption).\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

multiple `HoodieFlinkWriteClient`s are used for each stage of a single unit test. The `RemoteHoodieTableFileSystemView` from the previous `WriteClient` will be closed after they are done performing their individual tasks of the same test. \r\n\r\nWhen the next stage of the same test is invoked, the new `HoodieFlinkWriteClient` that is created will attempt to reuse an EmbeddedTimelineServer that has already been stopped, causing the error shown above.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to `org.apache.hudi.client.embedded.EmbeddedTimelineServerHelper#createEmbeddedTimelineService` for logic on how `EmbeddedTimelineServer` is created.\r\n\r\nFor a clearer flow of what is going on:\r\n\r\n```logs\r\n8629 [flink-akka.actor.default-dispatcher-10] INFO  org.apache.hudi.client.BaseHoodieClient [] - Stopping Timeline service !!\r\n18629 [flink-akka.actor.default-dispatcher-10] INFO  org.apache.hudi.client.embedded.EmbeddedTimelineService [] - Closing Timeline server\r\n18629 [flink-akka.actor.default-dispatcher-10] INFO  org.apache.hudi.timeline.service.TimelineService [] - Closing Timeline Service\r\n18641 [main] INFO  org.apache.hudi.client.BaseHoodieClient [] - Timeline Server already running.

Tearing down of the JM + TM is a non-blocking task.\r\n\r\nAs such, the next function `changeTableSchema` is invoked immediately prior to JM + TM's tear down is complete. Referring to the stack trace, one can see that the tear down is running while `changeTableSchema` is creating a `FlinkWriteClient`, which in turn creates a timeline service.\r\n\r\nSince tear down has not complete, the old embedded timeline server will be re-used. \r\n\r\nOnce tear down is complete, `changeTableSchema` will be using a `FlinkWriteClient` with an embedded  timeline server that has already been closed, causing the FLAKY integration tests (If teardown can complete fast enough, `changeTableSchema` will create a new EmbeddedTimelineServer, else, connection failure + error)\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\n\r\nNone, tests were fixed.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\nNone, tests were fixed.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe are recently added auto record key generation support mainly to cater to append only use-cases. So, as part of the work stream, this is a follow up patch. This patch makes bulk_insert as the default operation type for append only use-cases. For regular pipelines, \"upsert\" will be the default operation. \r\n\r\nWith this patch, users can now do the following w/ hudi. \r\n\r\n```\r\na. non-partitioned: df.write.format(\"hudi\").option(\"hoodie.table.name\",\"hudi_tbl\").save(path) -> will use bulk_insert. \r\nb. partitioned dataset: df.write.partitionBy(colA).format(\"hudi\").option(\"hoodie.table.name\",\"hudi_tbl\").save(path) -> will use bulk_insert. \r\nc. multi-field partitioning: df.write.partitionBy(colA, colB).format(\"hudi\").option(\"hoodie.table.name\",\"hudi_tbl\").save(path)  -> will use bulk_insert. \r\n``` \r\n\r\nIf any of the config is set among (record key,pre combine, operation), default operation is chosen to be \"upsert\" which has been the behavior so far. \r\n\r\n```\r\ndf.write.partitionBy(colA).format(\"hudi\").\r\noption(\"hoodie.table.name\",\"hudi_tbl\").\r\noption(\"hoodie.datasource.write.precombine.field\",\"updated_at\").\r\nsave(path) -> will use upsert. \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nGreatly improves the performance of hudi for append only use-cases. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNeed to update our hudi website w/ sufficient docs. \r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-12T16:41:38Z","updated_at":"2023-08-04T06:57:31Z","closed_at":"2023-08-04T06:57:30Z","merged_at":"2023-08-04T06:57:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"a60522a6fab074100164405c463d59aff7c4f5bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5187724363,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABNTZkSw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/release-0.14.0","name":"release-0.14.0","color":"B9BAA3","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/8697/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/8697/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/8697/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/214bc9b6f9c0d522f4196cca12daf4756dc96439","head":{"label":"nsivabalan:autoKeyGen_enable_bulk_insert","ref":"autoKeyGen_enable_bulk_insert","sha":"214bc9b6f9c0d522f4196cca12daf4756dc96439","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159547623,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk1NDc2MjM=","name":"hudi","full_name":"nsivabalan/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan/hudi","description":"Spark

Change Logs\r\n\r\nDelete operation in custom payload after RFC-46: while looking into a 0.13.1 release [blocker](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/8573), I found that custom payload implementation like AWS DMS payload and Debezium payload are not properly migrated to the new APIs introduced by RFC-46, causing the delete operation to fail.  Our tests did not catch this.  \r\n \r\nIt is currently assumed that delete records are marked by \"_hoodie_is_deleted\"; however, custom CDC payloads use op field to mark deletes.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by adding a new API `isDeleteRecord(GenericRecord genericRecord)` in `BaseAvroPayload` to allow the payload to implement custom logic to indicate if a record is a delete record.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes the failure when the custom payload uses another field to identify deletes.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNeed to

before using it\r\n\r\nIn [8653](https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/8653) we found that there are some write paths that will create tables without the `hoodie.datasource.write.hive_style_partitioning` in `hoodie.properties`. \r\n\r\nHence, it is unsafe to blindly assume the default value of `hoodie.datasource.write.hive_style_partitioning` when invoking `SparkHoodieTableFileIndex#composeRelativePartitionPath()`. If an assumption is used here, the method runs the risk of constructing a partitionPath that does not exists as it is in might be in the wrong format.\r\n\r\nThis is so as `BaseHoodieTableFileIndex#listPartitionPaths()` will attempt to create partitions when a partition path that does not exist is passed to it. \r\n\r\nAs such, this ticket is to add a validation-check to prevent `hoodie.datasource.write.hive_style_partitioning` from being used in an unsafe manner.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nValidate that `hoodie.datasource.write.hive_style_partitioning` is in `hoodie.properties` before using it.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nNone\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\nLow\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Enhancements to the MDT for improving performance of larger indexes.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\n**Major changes**\r\n\r\n1. Moved MDT compaction out of the pre-commit phase into the initialization phase within write client\r\n    - MDT compaction and clean is attempted during WriteClient initialization stage before any changes to the dataset are initiated. \r\n    - This ensures correct ordering of the compactions\r\n    - This also creates a codepath to call compaction on the MDT without actual commits\r\n\r\n2. Removed support for setting fileGroup count to the MetadataPartitionType enum\r\n\t- Since enums are singletons, this design prevented having multiple different datasets with different fileGroup count for MDT parttitions in the same JVM instance \r\n\t- When there are large number of fileGroups (assume 10K+) for a MDT partition, listing fileSlices for it may take a considerable amount of time (10K slices * M basefile version + 10K * N log files per slice). Hence, this should not be done as part of the HoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter constructor and delayed to whenever actually required (prepRecords).\r\n\r\n3. When initializing multiple MDT partitions together, they are handled one at a time\r\n    - Reduces memory requirements as larger indexes may need a huge amount of memory\r\n    - Improves chances of indexes being built.\r\n    - If the FILES partition is already initialized, it is listed to find the files thereby saving expensive entire dataset listing while \r\n      initializing addtional partitions\r\n\r\n4. Initial commit into MDT to initialize a new partition is not a bulkCommit \r\n    - HFiles are created directly for the first commit\r\n    - Since first commits write a large amount of data, bulkCommit into a basefile is much faster than writing log files\r\n    - Added SparkHoodieMetadataBulkInsertPartitioner as the bulk insert partitioner. It is optimized to partition records in a single pass.\r\n\r\n5. The number of fileGroups for each MDT partition are determined as part of the initialization process.\r\n    - This allows the fileGroup count to be optimized based on the number of records being added\r\n    \r\n**Other changes:**\r\n\r\n1. Created helper method to find if MDT partition is enabled: HoodieTableConfig.isMetadataPartitionEnabled()\r\n2. Created helper method to set state (enabled/disabled) of MDT partition: HoodieTableConfig.setMetadataPartitionState()\r\n3. Created helper method to delete MDT: HoodieTableMetadataUtil.deleteMetadataTable(). It correctly updates the hoodie.properties file.\r\n4. Created helper method to set inflight state (enabled/disabled) of MDT partition: HoodieTableMetadataUtil.setMetadataInflightPartitions\r\n5. Created helper method to delete MDT partition: deleteMetadataTablePartition. It correctly updates the hoodie.properties file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug introduced by #6847.  #6847 extends the `InProcessLockProvider` to support multiple tables in the same process, by having an in-memory static final map storing the mapping of the table base path to the read-write reentrant lock, so that the writer uses the corresponding lock based on the base path.  When closing the lock provider, `close()` removes the lock entry.  Since `close()` is called when closing the write client, the lock is removed and subsequent concurrent writers will get a different lock instance on the same table, causing the locking mechanism on the same table to be useless.  Take the following example where three writers write to the same table concurrently and need to acquire the in-process lock:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWriter 1:   lock |----------------| unlock and close\r\nWriter 2:   try lock   |      ...       lock |-------------| unlock and close\r\nWriter 3:                                    try lock  | ...  lock |------| unlock and close\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter Writer 1 releases the lock and closes the lock provider, the lock instance is removed from the map, and Writer 3 will get a different lock instance compared to Writer 2, making the lock ineffective.\r\n\r\nThe fix gets rid of the lock removal operation in the `close()` call since it has to be kept for concurrent writers.\r\n\r\nThis bug is uncovered while investigating the flaky test `testArchivalWithMultiWriters` (HUDI-6176) where concurrent cannot properly do archival due to the ineffective locking mechanism, although archival is guarded by locks.\r\n\r\nA new test `TestInProcessLockProvider#testLockIdentity` based on the above scenario is added to guard the behavior.  Before this fix, the test failed because of varying lock instances (see logs below); after the fix, the test succeeds.\r\n\r\n```\r\n1510 [ForkJoinPool-1-worker-9] INFO

Change Logs\r\nProvide file size stats for the latest updates that hudi is consuming. Without any options, only the size of the specified table will be displayed. Specifying --enable-partition-stats will also show stats at the partition level. If a start date (--start-date parameter) and/or end date (--end-date parameter) are specified, stats are based on files that were modified in the half-open interval [start date (--start-date parameter), end date (--end-date parameter)). --num-days parameter can be used to select data files over last --num-days. If --start-date is specified, --num-days will be ignored. If none of the date parameters are set, stats will be computed over all data files of all partitions in the table. Note that date filtering is carried out only if the partition name has the format '[column name=]yyyy-M-d', '[column name=]yyyy/M/d'.\r\nThe following stats are produced by this class:\r\n * Number of

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe PR adds tests to guard repeated dag trigger for various operations in datasource and deltastreamer. The operations covered are -\r\n1. insert\r\n2. bulk-insert\r\n3. upsert\r\n4. compaction\r\n5. clustering\r\n\r\nThe test uses StageEventManager to check if function call appears more than once in the spark stages. These functions are supposed to occur only once.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen reading from bootstrap base files, we now derive the partition path from the base file path instead of the regular file path. Additionally I unified some duplicate partition path parsing code and improved it by adding parsing for slash partition paths if it is hive encoded. Finally, I encode the partition path in the bootstrap relation to cancel out the decoding. I decided to make this change instead of modifying the parquet file readers, because this \r\nhas been fixed in spark 3.4 [SPARK-41970](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-41970) and because the parquet readers are such a core code path.\r\nAlso introduced `DecodedBootstrapPartitionPathTranslator` so you can choose to not have partition paths encoded when bootstraping a table with encoded characters in the partition path.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nCan now have encoded characters in your bootstrap base path partitions\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\nwrote a lot of testing to mitigate\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nMaybe it would be a good idea to write up a bootstrap doc for the site at some point.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n`ClusteringCommitSink` could strengthen commit and rollback strategy from two solutions:\r\n\r\n- Commit: Introduces `clusteringPlanCache` that caches to store clustering plan for each instant. `clusteringPlanCache` stores the mapping of instant_time -> clusteringPlan.\r\n- Rolback: Updates `commitBuffer` that stores the mapping of instant_time -> file_ids -> event. Use a map to collect the events because the rolling back of intermediate clustering tasks generates corrupt events.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nClustering commit and rollback strategy are improved. When the number of filegroups contained in the clustering plan is relatively large, it will be very expensive to read the clustering plan for each event received. Meanwhile, the rolling back of intermediate clustering tasks could generate corrupt events and collects the events via the map.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's

Introduced retry while reading hoodie.properties to deal with parallel updates.\n\n### Change Logs\n\n1. When reading the hoodie.properties, introduced a retry with delay\n  - Currently the retry is hardcoded to 5 times with a 1 second delay which should be sufficient for writer to complete updating the properties file.\n2. When updating the hoodie.properties, removed redundant reads of the file.\n\n\n### Impact\n\nHandles the rare case of race condition between a writer updating the hoodie.properties and a reader reading it at the same time.\n\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\n\nNone\n\n### Documentation Update\n\nNone\n\n### Contributor's checklist\n\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\n- [ ] CI

Check the return value from delete during rollback and finalize to ensure the files actually got deleted.\n\n### Change Logs\n\nReturn value from FileSystem.delete call is checked. It should be true in case delete was successful. If the return value is false, we check if the file exists.\n\n### Impact\n\nImproves the guarantee that files are deleted when required. We have seen cases where the call returns false and the file is left over. This causes data inconsistency issues (duplicate data, incomplete rollback) in HUDI dataset.\n\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\n\nNone\n\n### Documentation Update\n\nNone\n\n### Contributor's checklist\n\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\n- [ ] CI
