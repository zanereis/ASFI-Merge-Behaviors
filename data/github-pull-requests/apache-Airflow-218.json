PR builds are now better handled with regards to both\r\nrunning (using merge-request) and canceling (with cancel notifications).\r\n\r\nFirst of all we are using merged commit from the PR, not the original commit\r\nfrom the PR.\r\n\r\nSecondly - the workflow run notifies the original PR with comment\r\nstating that the image is being built in a separate workflow -\r\nincluding the link to that workflow.\r\n\r\nThirdly - when canceling duplicate PRs or PRs with failed\r\njobs, the workflow will add a comment to the PR stating the\r\nreason why the PR is being cancelled.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, we also add cancel job for the CodeQL duplicate\r\nmessages. They run for ~ 12 miinutes so it makes perfect sense to\r\nalso cancel those CodeQL jobs for which someone pushed fixups in a\r\nquick succession.\r\n\r\nFixes: #10471\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

has been raised quite a few times that workflow added in forked\r\nrepositories might be pretty invasive for the forks - especially\r\nwhen it comes to scheduled workflows as they might eat quota\r\nor at least jobs for those organisations/people who fork\r\nrepositories.\r\n\r\nThis is not strictly necessary because Recently GitHub recognized this as being\r\na problem and introduced new rules for scheduled workflows. But for people who\r\nare already forked, it would be nice to not run those actions. It is enough\r\nthat the CodeQL check is done when PR is opened to the \"apache/airflow\"\r\nrepository.\r\n\r\nQuote from the emails received by Github (no public URL explaining it yet):\r\n\r\n> Scheduled workflows will be disabled by default in forks of public repos and in\r\npublic repos with no activity for 60 consecutive days.  We’re making two\r\nchanges to the usage policy for GitHub Actions. These changes will enable\r\nGitHub Actions to scale with the incredible adoption we’ve seen from the GitHub\r\ncommunity. Here’s a quick overview:\r\n\r\n> * Starting today, scheduled workflows will be disabled by default in new forks of\r\npublic repositories.\r\n> * Scheduled workflows will be disabled in public repos

implementation uses an `OrderedDict` to handle `queued_tasks`. Every time the `trigger_tasks()` is invoked, it also invokes `order_queued_tasks_by_priority()` to order the `queued_tasks` by priority explicitly.\r\n\r\nInstead, this can be handled in a more straight forward & more efficient way via *Heap Queue* (*Priority Queue*) \r\n\r\n### Information for Review\r\n\r\n- A new attribute `self.queued_tasks_priority_queue` is added, acting as the `heap` (`List` type, array binary heap).\r\n- **[Important]** Python's `heapq` module only provides *Min Heap*, while we need a *Max Heap* here. So when we push new item to the heap, we use `-priority` (i.e. higher airflow-context-priority items have lower heapq-context priority, so will be fetched first in a Min Heap. In such a way, the Min Heap is used as a \"max heap\". Please refer to the line of `heappush` in `airflow/executors/base_executor.py`). \r\n- `self.queued_tasks` is kept, but changed from `OrderedDict` to `Set` (similar to `self.running`). This is because we have codes like `task_instance.key in self.queued_tasks`, so complexity O(1) should be favored.\r\n- method `__lt__(self, other)` is added for class `SimpleTaskInstance`. Otherwise we may encounter error *`TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'SimpleTaskInstance' and 'SimpleTaskInstance'`* when we try to push two tasks with the same priority into the heap.\r\n        \r\n\r\n### Reference\r\n\r\n- [heapq — Heap queue algorithm](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#10953.\r\n\r\nA refreshed UI for the 2.0 release. The existing \"theming\" is a bit long in the tooth and this PR attempts to give it a modern look and some freshness to compliment all of the new features under the hood.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the changes to UI have been done through updates to the Bootstrap theme contained in `bootstrap-theme.css`. These are simply overrides to the default stylings that are packaged with Bootstrap.\r\n\r\nI've tweaked, refactored, and cleaned up syntax across most of the view, script, and CSS files.\r\n\r\nI've highlighted outstanding questions in **bold** below.\r\n\r\n## Color\r\n\r\nImplements a full refresh of the color palette based on the colors in the [brand book](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Brandbook) (outlined in black below). Those colors have been expanded to a full color system robust enough to cover all aspects of the UI.\r\n\r\n**Where would the most ideal place to document this?** Out of scope for this PR, but I would typically put these all into CSS variables in a shared import file as documentation.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/94582389-2d8d4300-024a-11eb-9bd7-8d33f523b811.png)\r\n\r\n## Iconography\r\n\r\nThe current icon system (Bootstrap Glyficons) has been replaced with the [Material Design Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/) (Apache license version 2.0). They have a clean, modern look, and a robust selection. Like Glyficons, It is implemented via webfont. ~I attempted (and would have preferred) to install it via NPM package, but it appears that it is not kept up-to-date with their CDN/downloadable libraries, so instead am serving it via static files.~ The font has been converted to a Base64 encoding and embedded within the new `material-icons.css` stylesheet. This yields a cacheable file that doesn't require multiple requests (of importing font files).\r\n\r\nMost of the icons are very similar to their predecessors, others I've attempted to select the best representation possible based on the available set.\r\n<img width=\"331\" alt=\"Image 2020-09-29 at 2 32 16 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/94601127-02fab480-0261-11eb-9ae1-e850235e35a0.png\">\r\n\r\n## Typography\r\n\r\nThe UI currently does not utilize either of the font-families (Rubik, Operator Mono) designated by the brand guidelines. I did some experimentation with these, but there were some immediate, glaring problems in regards to the overall widths of Rubik. I may follow-up with a partial implementation that only applies to headings.\r\n\r\n## Global Header\r\n- Updated the global nav menus to open on hover instead of just on click.\r\n- Removed icons from the global nav items and their children (in drop-downs). They were implemented inconsistently and used the AppBuilder supplied FontAwesome icons. This simplifies the presentation and prevents us from mixing multiple conflicting-styled icon systems.\r\n- Removed the \"About\" navigation menu. It only contained a link to the \"Version\" view. Instead, I've taken the contents of the Version view and added a global footer that displays the same information.\r\n- Simplified the Time Zone selector by removing the day and seconds. The hours are the most relevant part of the timestamp when it comes to timezones. The constant motion of the changing seconds felt like a bit of a distraction. Tweaked the styling within the dropdown as well.\r\n- Replaced the current user's name with a circled monogram derived from their initials. Displays an icon fallback if first and last name values not present.\r\n- ~I've partially removed the ability to define a custom background color of the navbar (`navbar_color`), it likely wouldn't translate well for users who currently utilizing it since the navbar was previously optimized for a dark background bar. Appears to be a bit of a superfluous feature. Is it something we can remove completely in order to ensure a clean presentation, or does the support need to be left in?~ (edit: retained this feature)\r\n- I threw a little interaction easter egg in there—can you spot it?\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/94579694-1dc02f80-0247-11eb-8a89-8edba5a64e7b.png)\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/94579792-32042c80-0247-11eb-91cd-dce13e968496.png)\r\n\r\n**Fallback icon when no first/last name present:**\r\n<img width=\"144\" alt=\"Image 2020-09-29 at 1 35 21 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/94595884-5cf77c00-0259-11eb-9f2c-3caed7053f25.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**Version info in global footer:**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/94587875-30d7fd00-0251-11eb-83b8-ed93e203a2b8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## DAGs View (Home)\r\n- Updated the table presentation with a cleaner look that should be a bit more pleasing to look at.\r\n- Actions have been separated from links to better communicate their purpose. I do question wether the links should be here at all. They add a lot of visual noise and are certainly not intuitive for new users.\r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/94581865-96c08680-0249-11eb-88f0-7ba239232557.png)  |  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/94581145-bc995b80-0248-11eb-87f0-eb3e616c2661.png) |\r\n\r\n## DAG Views\r\nMost notable change across these views is the cleaned up run selection form fields. They now have a tidy presentation that is consistent across the views. I believe this further highlights the incongruence of the Task Instance navigation and why I've proposed #11089.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/94581640-4cd7a080-0249-11eb-832e-fd4d71e12c14.png)\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/94581514-30d3ff00-0249-11eb-87ec-f41d21e1b88f.png)\r\n\r\n## Flask AppBuilder CRUD Views\r\n\r\nThese views are automatically generated by AppBuilder, so there isn't access to markup/icon modifications (hence why they still use the Font Awesome icons). It is reliant on Bootstrap markup/classes, so I was able to update the colors to utilize the new theming.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/94579408-c9b54b00-0246-11eb-9eb3-2aae37375b89.png)\r\n\r\n## Misc.\r\n\r\nAdded all non-vendor stylesheets to the Webpack configuration. This outputs them with a fingerprinted filename and ensures the latest version isn't missed by the client due to caching.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-29T16:01:38Z","updated_at":"2020-11-21T00:49:39Z","closed_at":"2020-10-02T14:58:59Z","merged_at":"2020-10-02T14:58:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"24d0ecf4ee6dbfd2339847443d4b12033efe9c0f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

is an improvement to the UI response time when clearing dozens of DagRuns of large DAGs (thousands of tasks) containing many `ExternalTaskSensor` + `ExternalTaskMarker` pairs. In the current implementation, clearing tasks can get slow especially if the user chooses to clear with Future, Downstream and Recursive all selected. \r\n\r\nThis PR speeds it up. There are two major improvements:\r\n\r\n- Updating `self._task_group` in `dag.sub_dag()` is improved to not deep copy `_task_group` because it's a waste of time. Instead, do something like `dag.task_dict`, set it to None first and then copy explicitly.\r\n- Pass the `TaskInstance` already visited down the recursive calls of `dag.clear()` as `visited_external_tis`. This speeds up the example in `test_clear_overlapping_external_task_marker` by almost five folds. \r\n\r\nFor real large dags containing 500 tasks set up in a similar manner, the time it takes to clear 30 DagRun is cut from around 100s to less than

is the third (and not last) part of making the Production\r\nimage more corporate-environment friendly. It's been prepared\r\nfor the request of one of the big Airflow user (company) that\r\nhas rather strict security requirements when it comes to\r\npreparing and building images. They are committed to\r\nsynchronizing with the progress of Apache Airflow 2.0 development\r\nand making the image customizable so that they can build it using\r\nonly sources controlled by them internally was one of the important\r\nrequirements for them.\r\n\r\nThis change adds the possibilty of customizing various steps in\r\nthe build process:\r\n\r\n* adding custom scripts to be run before installation of both\r\n  build image and runtime image. This allows for example to\r\n  add installing custom GPG keys, and adding custom sources.\r\n\r\n* customizing the way NodeJS and Yarn are installed in the\r\n  build image segment - as they might rely on their own way\r\n  of installation.\r\n\r\n* adding extra packages to be installed during both build and\r\n  dev segment build steps. This is crucial to achieve the same\r\n  size optimizations as the original image.\r\n\r\n* defining additional environment variables (for example\r\n  environment variables that indicate acceptance of the EULAs\r\n  in case of installing proprietary packages that require\r\n  EULA acceptance - both in the build image and runtime image\r\n  (again the goal is to keep the image optimized for size)\r\n\r\nThe image build process remains the same when no customization\r\noptions are specified, but having those options increases\r\nflexibility of the image build process in corporate environments.\r\n\r\nThis is part of #11171.\r\n\r\nThis change also fixes some of the issues opened and raised by\r\nother users of the Dockerfile.\r\n\r\nFixes: #10730\r\nFixes: #10555\r\nFixes: #10856\r\n\r\nInput from those issues has been taken into account when this\r\nchange was designed so that the cases described in those issues\r\ncould be implemented. Example from one of the issue landed as\r\nan example way of building highly customized Airflow Image\r\nusing those customization options.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

TO REVIEWER** - please review only the last commit - the other is part of #11173\r\n\r\nThis is the second step of making the Production Docker Image more\r\ncorporate-environment friendly, by making MySQL client installation\r\noptional. Instaling MySQL Client on Debian requires to reach out\r\nto oracle deb repositories which might not be approved by security\r\nteams when you build the images. Also not everyone needs MySQL\r\nclient or might want to install their own MySQL client or MariaDB\r\nclient - from their own repositories.\r\n\r\nThis change makes the installation step separated out to\r\nscript (with prod/dev installation option). The prod/dev separation\r\nis needed because MySQL needs to be installed with dev libraries\r\nin the \"Build\" segment of the image (requiring build essentials\r\netc.) but in \"Final\" segment of

few PRs, ideas and exchanges, we reached the consensus to make `start-airflow` a full fledged Breeze command and add some specific flags.\r\n\r\n`./breeze start-airflow` starts the Airflow Scheduler and Webserver, it then leaves the user in front of a tmux session with the possibility to observe errors and use the Breeze shell. From the tmux shell is possible to run `./stop_airflow.sh` to stop the Airflow components and close tmux.\r\n\r\nBy default `start-airflow` will not create the default connections or load the example dags. Two flags can be used if these objects are necessary: `--load-default-connections` and `--load-example-dags`.\r\n\r\nIn the previous implementation as flag, the init script was executed twice; to avoid this the tmux session is executed at a later stage with the script `scripts/in_container/run_tmux.sh`.\r\n\r\nPrevious PRs to check the history of this feature:\r\n[Starting breeze will run an init script after the environment is setup #11029](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/11029)\r\n[Introducing flags to skip example dags and default connections #11099\r\n](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/11099)\r\n[Revert \"Introducing flags to skip example dags and default connection…

Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code change, Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License

It returns the same response dictionary as before. It is now using the `pdpyras.EventsAPISession` class which is a session class for submitting events to the PagerDuty Events API v2.\r\n\r\n### PagerdutyHook.get_session\r\nThere is an additional `PagerdutyHook.get_session()` method which returns a `pdpyras.APISession` for use with sending or receiving data through the PagerDuty REST API (different from the PagerDuty Events API v2). Because the updated `PagerdutyHook.create_event` method does not use the PagerDuty API token at all (it only uses the `routing_key`) I had to find another use of the API token, and the `PagerdutyHook.get_session()` method will actually make use of the API token. When using the method to get an API session you are able to use any of the methods defined in the [pdpyras documentation](https://pagerduty.github.io/pdpyras/).\r\n\r\nThe intention of this PR is to both update `PagerdutyHook.create_event` to use the newer `pdpyras` package and to have a starting off point for adding additional methods for the PagerDuty REST API to this hook in the future as needed. I did not include other methods because I didn't want to just fully port over all of the `pdpyras.APISession` methods into this hook and I think it is enough for a user of the hook to be able to use the APISession as needed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

AND dag_id = ? AND execution_date = ?) OR (task_id = ? AND dag_id = ? AND execution_date = ?)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is fine for one or maybe even 100 TIs, but when testing DAGs at\r\nextreme size (over 21k tasks!) this query was taking for ever (162s on\r\nPostgres, 172s on MySQL 5.7)\r\n\r\nBy changing this query to this\r\n\r\n```\r\nWHERE task_id IN (?,?) AND dag_id = ? AND execution_date = ?\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe time is reduced to 1s! (1.03s on Postgres, 1.19s on MySQL)\r\n\r\nEven on 100 tis the reduction is large, but the overall time is not\r\nsignificant (0.01451s -> 0.00626s on Postgres).\r\n\r\nTimes included SQLA query construction time (but not time for calling\r\nfilter_for_tis. So a like-for-like comparison), not just DB query time:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nipdb> start_filter_20k = time.monotonic(); result_filter_20k = session.query(TI).filter(tis_filter).all(); end_filter_20k = time.monotonic()\r\nipdb> end_filter_20k - start_filter_20k\r\n172.30647455298458\r\nipdb> in_filter = TI.dag_id == self.dag_id, TI.execution_date == self.execution_date, TI.task_id.in_([o.task_id for o in old_states.keys()]);\r\nipdb> start_20k_custom = time.monotonic(); result_custom_20k = session.query(TI).filter(in_filter).all(); end_20k_custom = time.monotonic()\r\nipdb> end_20k_custom - start_20k_custom\r\n1.1882996069907676\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have also removed the check that was ensuring everything was of the\r\nsame type (all TaskInstance or all TaskInstanceKey) as it felt needless\r\n- both types have the three required fields, so the \"duck-typing\"\r\n  approach at runtime (crash if doesn't have the required property)+mypy\r\n  checks felt Good Enough.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
