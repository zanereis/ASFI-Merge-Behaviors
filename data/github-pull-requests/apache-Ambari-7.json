are checking - command['custom_command'] == CustomCommand.restart\r\n\r\nBut this is incorrect since the key is inside commandParams, so correct check should be: command['commandParams']['custom_command'] == CustomCommand.restart\r\n\r\nProblems due to this:\r\nCurrently if we stop a component and give RESTART , then on agent side DESIRED state is still INSTALLED but current state gets to STARTED state. Now if we manually kill the process or the process gets shutdown, it will not recover since CURRENT state == DESIRED state == INSTALLED.\r\n\r\nWith this bug fix, we should be able to recover those tasks as well.\r\n\r\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAccording to current delete flow, we are deleting the cache data first and then deleting data from db. But if due to anycase like Rollback exceptions , we delete the data from cache but data in DB is rollbacked. Due to this when again we try to delete the host data, it throws hostNotFound since it takes this check from cache given below.\r\n\r\nSet clusters = getHostClustersMap().get(hostname);\r\nif (clusters == null) {\r\nthrow new HostNotFoundException(hostname);\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (!getHostsByName().containsKey(hostname)) { throw new HostNotFoundException(\"Could not find host \" + hostname); }\r\n\r\nSo even though data is not actually deleted from DB , we still wont delete from DB because of this. The current way is to restart ambari server which fills up the cache again and then it works fine, but until that, we wont be able to delete anything for this hostName.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAccording to current delete flow, we are deleting the cache data first and then deleting data from db. But if due to anycase like Rollback exceptions , we delete the data from cache but data in DB is rollbacked. Due to this when again we try to delete the host data, it throws hostNotFound since it takes this check from cache given below.\r\n \r\nSet<Cluster> clusters = getHostClustersMap().get(hostname);\r\n    if (clusters == null) {\r\n      throw new HostNotFoundException(hostname);\r\n    }\r\n \r\nif (!getHostsByName().containsKey(hostname)) { throw new HostNotFoundException(\"Could not find host \" + hostname); }\r\n    \r\nSo even though data is not actually deleted from DB , we still wont delete from DB because of this. The current  way is to restart ambari server which fills up the cache again and then it works fine, but until that, we wont be able to delete anything for this hostName.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen starting up or shutting down Ambari Metics in HA mode the following exceptions appear in the log:\r\n\r\n`javax.management.InstanceAlreadyExistsException: ClusterStatus: cluster=... ,instanceName=...`\r\nand\r\n`javax.management.InstanceNotFoundException: ClusterStatus: cluster=..,instanceName=...,resourceName=...`\r\n\r\nThese are happening when trying to register/unregister an MBean.\r\nThe double registration happens because the `HelixController` class was a subclass of `GenericHelixController` class, thus effectively it was a _Controller_ instance, despite the fact that it only needs to be a listener to track live Collector instances. By registering this `HelixController` class we basically used **two Controllers**, that caused the double registration and wasting of resources.\r\n\r\nThe fix refactored `HelixController` to a `LiveInstanceTracker` class that is only a listener this way eliminating the situation where we had two Controllers.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the fix refactors the shutdown mechanism `MetricCollectorHAController` to provide a more graceful shutdown. \r\nCode cleanup was also performed.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe change was tested manually by setting up a Ambari Metrics HA cluster and testing start up and shutdown of instances.\r\n- Stopping one of the instances to check HA capabilities and the cleanness of the shutdown.\r\n- Starting the stopped instance to see if the HA state restored and there are no complains about the MBean registration.\r\n- Did the same tests of stopping/starring both instances together.","created_at":"2021-03-29T14:39:22Z","updated_at":"2021-04-28T06:28:08Z","closed_at":"2021-04-28T06:28:08Z","merged_at":"2021-04-28T06:28:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"99384078da451f65ed670fa8a378d91ce46f81bf","assignee":{"login":"payert","id":35402259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDAyMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35402259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert","html_url":"https://github.com/payert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"payert","id":35402259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDAyMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35402259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert","html_url":"https://github.com/payert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":837489401,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4Mzc0ODk0MDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/labels/ambari-metrics","name":"ambari-metrics","color":"7eb519","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/pulls/3304/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/pulls/3304/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3304/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/statuses/db1fca7fcd52ee3e66b35229c4959f197938be0b","head":{"label":"payert:AMBARI-25635-branch-2.7","ref":"AMBARI-25635-branch-2.7","sha":"db1fca7fcd52ee3e66b35229c4959f197938be0b","user":{"login":"payert","id":35402259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDAyMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35402259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert","html_url":"https://github.com/payert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":175391444,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzUzOTE0NDQ=","name":"ambari","full_name":"payert/ambari","private":false,"owner":{"login":"payert","id":35402259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDAyMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35402259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert","html_url":"https://github.com/payert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/payert/ambari","description":"Mirror

a decommissioned NM's behaviour\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs part of our use case, before we STOP any set of components in a node, if we see a NodeManager and Datanode in that node, we first Decommission them and then issue STOP components to all the components in the node.\r\n\r\nDataNodes once decommissioned are not STOPPED but they are alive as a process. Unless we stop them. Whereas RM stops the NM on decommission. (this is a known behaviour). But what happens is that the RecoveryManager in ambari keeps restarting the service thinking its DESIRED state (in the agent side) is STARTED. So the restart keeps happening. So the state changes between STARTED <-> INSTALLED on the agent side and once this happens we communicate the Component status to the server side.\r\nOn receiving this update the server sets the STATE as STARTED/INSTALLED as the case may be.\r\nNow coming back to the actual STOP command request that we gave, as per design in ambari server once all the component updates are sent, it processes them in batch and tries to do the in-memory transition of STATES on the server side (not the cache but the FSM (state machine transition). Here the event is INSTALL/STOP event for NM that the server is expecting but instead of getting an INSTALLED state it gets STARTED state. The reason as highlighted above. So the entire STOP command gets aborted by the server thinking there is some problem in what it sees.\r\n/Multimap is analog of Map<Object, List<Object>> but allows to avoid nested loop\r\n        ListMultimap<String, ServiceComponentHostEvent> eventMap = formEventMap(stage, commandsToStart);\r\n        Map<ExecutionCommand, String> commandsToAbort = new HashMap<>();\r\n        if (!eventMap.isEmpty()) {\r\n          LOG.debug(\"==> processing {} serviceComponentHostEvents...\", eventMap.size());\r\n          Cluster cluster = clusters.getCluster(stage.getClusterName());\r\n          if (cluster != null) {\r\n            Map<ServiceComponentHostEvent, String> failedEvents = cluster.processServiceComponentHostEvents(eventMap);\r\n\r\n            if (failedEvents.size() > 0) {\r\n              LOG.error(\"==> {} events failed.\", failedEvents.size());\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            for (Iterator<ExecutionCommand> iterator = commandsToUpdate.iterator(); iterator.hasNext(); ) {\r\n              ExecutionCommand cmd = iterator.next();\r\n              for (ServiceComponentHostEvent event : failedEvents.keySet()) {\r\n                if (StringUtils.equals(event.getHostName(), cmd.getHostname()) &&\r\n                  StringUtils.equals(event.getServiceComponentName(), cmd.getRole())) {\r\n                  iterator.remove();\r\n                  commandsToAbort.put(cmd, failedEvents.get(event));\r\n                  break;\r\n                }\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\nCheck the processServiceComponentHostEvents() for the way the transition happens and what is the Invalid Transition that happens over there. The log msg would be like this\r\norg.apache.ambari.server.state.fsm.InvalidStateTransitionException: Invalid event: HOST_SVCCOMP_INSTALL at STARTED\r\nSince this entire set of STOP component is considered as a FAILURe, we issue ABORT command and hence all the STOP command issued to the agent are aborted.\r\nThis makes the DN to stay in the STARTED state itself and hence the remaining DELETE HOST command keeps failing.\r\nThe idea is to ensure that for NM if decommissioned and the current state is STARTED for a HOST_SVCCOMP_INSTALL then mark it as not a failure condition so that the commands are not aborted.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. Ex: unit tests, manual tests)\r\nThe patch was tested with a scale down feature of more than 20 nodes at one shot.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new ambari-agent parameter: `secret_hidden_pattern` to define which kind of attributes in log printing need to be hidden values. This parameter accepts regular expressions for users to custom hidden rule as the actual situation. The default value `(?i).*(secret|password).*` means that only the key contains keyword password would be handled.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Fix jvm metrics of the ams-hbase and hbase compoments cannot be displayed\r\n2. Rename some widget name  in ams-hbase/hbase and introduced new G1GC related metrics, as shown below:\r\n\r\n| location                              | old title          | curren title                            |\r\n| ------------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |\r\n| hbase-regionservers/JVM-GC COUNTS     | GC Count ParNew /s | GC Count(ParNew/G1 Young Generation) /s |\r\n| hbase-regionservers/JVM-GC TIMES      | GC Times ParNew /s | GC Times(ParNew/G1 Young Generation) /s |\r\n| ams-hbase-regionservers/JVM-GC COUNTS | GC Count ParNew /s | GC Count(ParNew/G1 Young Generation) /s |\r\n| hbase-regionservers/JVM-GC COUNTS     | GC Times ParNew /s | GC Times(ParNew/G1 Young Generation) /s |\r\n\r\nThis modification mainly considers that HBase may now use G1GC or CMS. The previous widget names only covered CMS metrics. We renamed the widget titles , and also introduced the metricscorresponding to G1GC into the widget to ensure that both  G1GC and CMS can be displayed normally.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

Null value was being wrote as array of zero bytes, so after reading of this value we got not Null, but array of zero bytes. Now array of zero bytes is being interpreted as Null. Also as result we shouldn't generate UUIDs which contain only zero bytes.\r\n\r\nAlso made some fixes in ambari datasource.js for grafana.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual test:\r\n- created kafka-based and usual storm topologies and checked that all appropriate metrics are being displayed.\r\n- run metrics tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n**1. Introduce an '--allmetrics' to enforce migration of all metrics regardless of other settings.**\r\nDue to the suboptimal argument handling, if one wants to define an argument that comes after the 'whitelist file'\r\nargument - like the 'starttime' - the 'whitelist file' argument must be defined.\r\nBut when we don't want to use the whitelist data because we need to migrate all the metrics the '--allmetrics' argument can be provided instead of 'whitelist file'.\r\n\r\nExample: migrate all the metrics from the last year\r\n`/usr/sbin/ambari-metrics-collector --config /etc/ambari-metrics-collector/conf/ upgrade_start --allmetrics \"365\"`\r\n\r\n**2. The start time handling has been fixed and changed**\r\n - The code is intended to migrate data from the \"last x milliseconds\" as the handling of the default data shows where the startTime is subtracted from the current timestamp.\r\n`public static final long DEFAULT_START_TIME = System.currentTimeMillis() - ONE_MONTH_MILLIS; //Last month`\r\nBut when the user externally provided the `startTime` value it was not subtracted from the current timestamp, but was used as it is, which is indeed erroneous.\r\n- Also, I suggest using days instead of milliseconds to define the required migration time window, because it is a more realistic and convenient granularity. Like in the above example the command will migrate data from the last 365 days.\r\n- Time handling has been changed to `LocalDateTime` use in Java 8 fashion.\r\n\r\n3. **Possibly improve performance** by reducing synchronisation granularity and using BufferedWriter when writing the \"ambari-metrics-migration-state\"\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n- It was tested by manually migrating large data sets derived from real world data.\r\n- Running the existing unit tests.","created_at":"2020-11-02T16:59:33Z","updated_at":"2020-12-04T10:21:43Z","closed_at":"2020-12-04T10:21:43Z","merged_at":"2020-12-04T10:21:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"a4990d9431643b82d1ec35ae1cd0c0739b5f7035","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":837489401,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4Mzc0ODk0MDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/labels/ambari-metrics","name":"ambari-metrics","color":"7eb519","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/pulls/3254/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/pulls/3254/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3254/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/statuses/ec28c5cb0d262898029d79bd0f6fae21a35c4e0b","head":{"label":"payert:AMBARI-25569-addendum-branch-2.7","ref":"AMBARI-25569-addendum-branch-2.7","sha":"ec28c5cb0d262898029d79bd0f6fae21a35c4e0b","user":{"login":"payert","id":35402259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDAyMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35402259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert","html_url":"https://github.com/payert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":175391444,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzUzOTE0NDQ=","name":"ambari","full_name":"payert/ambari","private":false,"owner":{"login":"payert","id":35402259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDAyMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35402259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert","html_url":"https://github.com/payert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/payert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/payert/ambari","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n### 1. Alter the metrics from `rpc.rpc.datanode.xx` to   `rpc.rpc.xx`\r\n\r\nThe abnormal metrics in Granfana were defined as follows:\r\n\r\nmetric | widget name\r\n-- | --\r\nrpc.rpc.**datanode**.RpcQueueTimeAvgTime | RPC Service Port Queue Time\r\nrpc.rpc.**datanode**.RpcQueueTimeNumOps | RPC Service Port Queue Ops\r\nrpc.rpc.**datanode**.RpcProcessingTimeAvgTime | RPC Service Port Processing Time\r\nrpc.rpc.**datanode**.RpcProcessingTimeNumOps | RPC Service Port Processing Num Ops\r\nrpc.rpc.**datanode**.CallQueueLength | RPC Service Port Call Queue Length\r\nrpc.rpc.**datanode**.RpcSlowCalls | RPC Service Port Port Slow Calls\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGranafa used  `rpc.rpc.datanode.xx` but in ams-hbase, they are stored like: `rpc.rpc.xx`:\r\n![the metrics stored in ams-hbase](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52202080/95838641-98736980-0d74-11eb-9f23-7a5b701c534b.png)\r\n\r\n![query by rest](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52202080/95839028-12a3ee00-0d75-11eb-94fa-467c4e33c47b.png)\r\n\r\nSo I altered the metrics from `rpc.rpc.datanode.xx` to   `rpc.rpc.xx`\r\n\r\n### 2. Move datanode-related metrics from the namenode page to the datanode page\r\nThe missing metircs belong to the DataNode, but the appId used by the Granafa is NameNode,  these metrics should be displayed in `DataNode` page.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n**1. The metrics after moved into the DataNode page shows ok:**\r\n\r\n![fixed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52202080/96895654-34ad1700-14bf-11eb-813d-d037f3c665ce.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n **2. datanode-related meitrics  do not display in the namenode page**\r\n![Removed unreleased metrics from NameNode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52202080/96828111-98a4f080-1469-11eb-82e6-ea5fb3dda6b2.png)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-13T09:36:22Z","updated_at":"2020-10-23T08:26:18Z","closed_at":"2020-10-23T08:23:26Z","merged_at":"2020-10-23T08:23:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"faf9e58655f0a9ded84eeabb674d8acaad69dc24","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":837489401,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4Mzc0ODk0MDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/labels/ambari-metrics","name":"ambari-metrics","color":"7eb519","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/pulls/3243/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/pulls/3243/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3243/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/statuses/c7a384d83d128606b8d8d8f1aa039c270b25824a","head":{"label":"echohlne:AMBARI-25570","ref":"AMBARI-25570","sha":"c7a384d83d128606b8d8d8f1aa039c270b25824a","user":{"login":"echohlne","id":52202080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMjAyMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52202080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne","html_url":"https://github.com/echohlne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:branch-2.7","ref":"branch-2.7","sha":"fe2cca79cad9ce4f9872f0217e8ae31f25431bcd","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":2442457,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDQyNDU3","name":"ambari","full_name":"apache/ambari","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ambari","description":"Apache
