Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDoris have 2 mem limits for load task:\r\n1. Total mem limit for all load tasks, default 50% of process memory\r\n2. Mem limit for a single load task, same with the query mem limit, controled by `exec_mem_limit`, default 2GB\r\n\r\nFor now, we found some issues on this policy:\r\n1. Easy to generate too many small segments. If a table have 100 tablets on 1 BE, in the default mem limit, each tablet can only write 20MB data to memtable in average.\r\n2. Easy to hang all tablet writer threads. If one load channel reached it's mem limit, it will hold a lock and wait there until the chosen memtable flush finished. Any incoming write request on this load task will hang there to wait the lock, so it's easy to exahaust all tablet writer threads.\r\n\r\nThis patch porpose the following changes\r\n1. Remove mem limit for single load task\r\n2. Add a soft limit, when total memory reached the soft limit, will pick a larget load channel to flush\r\n\r\nThe improved policy have following benifits\r\n1. For a single load task, it can use more than 2GB memory if there are lots of free memory, which can avoid generating lots of small segments\r\n2. When reach the soft limit, the lagest memory consumer will be picked, and try to flush it's 1/3 mem\r\n3. Other thread won't be blocked if hard limit not reached\r\n4. soft limit can help to free memory as soon as possible, before reaching the hard limit\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nAfter the consume mem tracker exceeds the mem limit in the mem hook, the boost stacktrace will be printed. A query/load will only be printed once, and the process tracker will only be printed once per second.\r\n\r\nAfter the process memory reaches the upper limit, the boost stacktrace will be printed every second. The observed phenomena are as follows:\r\n1. After query/load is canceled, the memory increases instantly;\r\n2. tcmalloc profile total physical memory is less than perf process memory;\r\n3. The process mem tracker is smaller than the perf process memory;\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n5. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n6. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem Summary\r\n\r\nFollowing the iteration order of the hash table will result in out-of-order access to aggregate states, which is very inefficient.\r\nTraversing aggregate states in memory write order can significantly improve memory read efficiency.\r\n\r\n### Test \r\n> hash table items count: 3.35M\r\n\r\n1. Before this optimization: insert keys into column takes 500ms\r\n2. With this optimization only takes 80ms\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-17T14:59:40Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T06:58:51Z","closed_at":"2022-09-21T06:58:51Z","merged_at":"2022-09-21T06:58:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"8f4bb0f804ecd6ce23b3878d8540be05ef59fc96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\ntcmalloc/jemalloc allocator cache does not participate in the mem check as part of the process physical memory.\r\n\r\nbecause `new/malloc` will trigger mem hook when using tcmalloc/jemalloc allocator cache, but it may not actually alloc physical memory, which is not expected in mem hook fail.\r\n\r\nin addition:\r\n1. The value of tcmalloc/jemalloc allocator cache is used as a mem tracker, the parent is the process mem tracker, which is updated every 1s.\r\n2. Modify the process default `mem_limit` to 90%. expect mem tracker to effectively limit the memory usage of the process.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-16T16:27:24Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T00:55:08Z","closed_at":"2022-09-17T03:31:02Z","merged_at":"2022-09-17T03:31:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"3bb042e45cdfe81a025a779ac121b3ccf3934fc4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1693771265,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkzNzcxMjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/docs","name":"kind/docs","color":"c7def8","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\nThis pr did these things:\r\n1. Change the nullable mode of 'from_unixtime' and 'parse_url' from DEPEND_ON_ARGUMENT to ALWAYS_NULLABLE, which nullable configuration was missing previously.\r\n2. Add some new interfaces for origin NullableMode. This change inspired by the grammar of scala's mix-in trait, It help us to quickly understand the traits of function without read the lengthy procedural code and save the work to write some template code, like `class Substring extends ScalarFunction implements ImplicitCastInputTypes, PropagateNullable`. These are the interfaces:\r\n   - PropagateNullable: equals to NullableMode.DEPEND_ON_ARGUMENT\r\n   - AlwaysNullable: equals to NullableMode.ALWAYS_NULLABLE\r\n   - AlwaysNotNullable: equals to NullableMode.ALWAYS_NOT_NULLABLE\r\n   - others ComputeNullable: equals to NullableMode.CUSTOM\r\n3. Add `GenerateScalarFunction` to generate nereids-style function code from legacy functions, but not actual generate any new function class yet, because the function's trait is not ready for use. I need add some traits for the legacy function's CompareMode and NonDeterministic, this thought is the same as ComputeNullable.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #12661\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nWhen the flush is triggered when the load channel exceeds the mem limit, if the flush fails, an error message is returned and the load is terminated.\r\n\r\nUsually flush failure is -238 error code. Because the memtable is frequently flushed after the load channel exceeds the mem limit, the number of segments exceeds the max value.\r\n\r\nBefore fix:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13197424/190564895-17f93550-e630-4c62-a7af-2e03de571112.png)\r\n\r\nAfter fix:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13197424/190564839-5fef5e57-a80e-437c-a911-78862e188e97.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n[Parquet v1.11+ supports page skipping](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/PageIndex.md), which helps the scanner reduce the amount of data scanned, decompressed, decoded, and insertion. According to the performance FlameGraph, decompression takes up 20% cpu time. If a page can be filtered as a whole, the page can not be decompressed.\r\n\r\nHowever, the row numbers between pages are not aligned. Columns containing predicates can be filtered by page granularity, but other columns need to be skipped within pages, so non predicate columns can only save the decoding and insertion time.\r\n\r\nArray column needs the repetition level to align with other columns, so the array column can only save the decoding and insertion time.\r\n\r\n## Explore\r\n`OffsetIndex` in the column metadata can locate the page position. Theoretically, a page can be completely skipped, including the time of reading from HDFS. However, the average size of a page is around 500KB. Skipping a page requires calling the `skip`. The performance of `skip` is low when it is called frequently, and may not be better than continuous reading of large blocks of data (such as 4MB).\r\n\r\nIf multiple consecutive pages are filtered, `skip` reading can be performed according to`OffsetIndex`. However, for the convenience of programming and readability, the data of all pages are loaded and filtered in turn.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nChange the trigger condition from `pull_request` to `pull_request_target`.\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n> Due to the dangers inherent to automatic processing of PRs, GitHub’s standard pull_request workflow trigger by default prevents write permissions and secrets access to the target repository. However, in some scenarios such access is needed to properly process the PR. To this end the pull_request_target workflow trigger was introduced.\r\n\r\nAccording to the article [Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/) , the trigger condition in `shellcheck.yml` which is `pull_request` can't comment the PR due to the lack of write permissions of the workflow.\r\n\r\nDespite the `ShellCheck` workflow checkouts the source, but it doesn't build and test the source code. I think it is safe to change the trigger condition from `pull_request` to `pull_request_target` which can make the workflow have write permissions to comment the PR.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis PR changed some interfaces to avoid unsafe cast.\r\n\r\n- Modify `Plan.getExpressions()`'s return type from `List<Expression>` to `List<? extends Expression>`\r\nReturn projects (type is a list of named expression) in `getExpressions` can avoid unsafe cast. See `LogicalProject.getExpression()` as an example.\r\n\r\n- Modify `EmptyRelation.getProjects()`'s return type from `List<NamedExpression>` to `List<? extends NamedExpression>`\r\nCreating empty relation with a list of slots can avoid unsafe cast. See the `EliminateLimit` rule for example.\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-14T09:59:41Z","updated_at":"2022-09-15T04:02:35Z","closed_at":"2022-09-15T04:02:35Z","merged_at":"2022-09-15T04:02:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"d2d5c19d513106fdf9526f485c5bb2adc290e2cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4101900299,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBfSlxs70fggL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/nereids","name":"area/nereids","color":"21BA9F","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/12603/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/12603/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/12603/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/statuses/57a61f1c3a944b4c95855f97df212865bf53ce5f","head":{"label":"wangshuo128:unsafe-cast","ref":"unsafe-cast","sha":"57a61f1c3a944b4c95855f97df212865bf53ce5f","user":{"login":"wangshuo128","id":4003322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDMzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4003322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128","html_url":"https://github.com/wangshuo128","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":390284265,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTAyODQyNjU=","name":"doris","full_name":"wangshuo128/doris","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangshuo128","id":4003322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDMzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4003322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128","html_url":"https://github.com/wangshuo128","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangshuo128/doris","description":"Apache
