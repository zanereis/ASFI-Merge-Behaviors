handle the case when a location in an array is written multiple times. For example, the following program will pass the check, but we cannot make A and B to be the same array. \r\n```c++\r\nA[0] = B[0] + 1\r\nA[0] = B[0] + 1\r\n```\r\nThe high-level code generator needs to ensure that the generated code only write each location of the target once. This is the case with the current schedule.\r\n\r\nThis limitation is documented in the comment\r\n\r\nSo this pass works fine for now. To enhance the safety, we might be able to use another pass to detect some sufficient condition when an array is written once in each location, which requires some work but can be useful to make it work for an arbitrary segment of IR. \r\n

TLDR\r\n\r\nCurrently the following demo program runs and gets the correct result.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import, print_function\r\n\r\nimport tvm\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nn = tvm.var(\"n\")\r\nA = tvm.placeholder((n,), name='A')\r\nB = tvm.placeholder((n,), name='B')\r\nC = tvm.compute(A.shape, lambda i: A[i] + B[i], name=\"C\")\r\n\r\ns = tvm.create_schedule(C.op)\r\ns[C].opengl()\r\n\r\nfadd_gl = tvm.build(s, [A, B, C], \"opengl\", name=\"myadd\")\r\nprint(\"------opengl code------\")\r\nprint(fadd_gl.imported_modules[0].get_source(fmt=\"gl\"))\r\n\r\nctx = tvm.opengl(0)\r\nn = 10\r\na = tvm.nd.array(np.random.uniform(size=(n)).astype(A.dtype), ctx)\r\nb = tvm.nd.array(np.random.uniform(size=(n)).astype(B.dtype), ctx)\r\nc = tvm.nd.array(np.zeros((n), dtype=C.dtype), ctx)\r\nfadd_gl(a, b, c)\r\n\r\nnp.testing.assert_allclose(c.asnumpy(), a.asnumpy() + b.asnumpy())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe corresponding fragment shader is\r\n\r\n```glsl\r\n#version 330 core\r\nuniform sampler2D A;\r\nuniform sampler2D B;\r\nout float C;\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  ivec2 threadIdx = ivec2(gl_FragCoord.xy);\r\n  C = (texelFetch(A, ivec2(threadIdx.x, 0), 0).r + texelFetch(B, ivec2(threadIdx.x, 0), 0).r);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Current Status\r\n\r\n### OpenGL Tensor Storage\r\n- We store tensors in OpenGL textures.\r\n- No matter what dimensions a tensor has, we always store it in a 2D texture with height=1.\r\n- The reason we are not using 1D textures is that `texelFetch` in GLSL only supports 2D textures.\r\n- We support uint{8,16,32}, int{8,16,32} and float32 textures.\r\n\r\n### OpenGL Schedule\r\n- We added an `opengl` schedule, which basically fuses all dimensions into one and binds that single dimension to threadIdx.x.\r\n\r\n### Codegen\r\n- We haven't changed lowering at all. When the IR says `Store(buffer, index)` and the buffer happens to be the output texture, we check that index must be `threadIdx.x`, and emit code to output a pixel.\r\n- The codegen part has only been started. We will go through all the AST nodes as our next step.\r\n\r\n### Task Items\r\n- <del>Remove the dependency on glfw and glad.</del> Emscripten supports glfw. Glad removed.\r\n- <del>Investigate emscripten.</del> Runtime runnable.\r\n- <del>Support other types than float.</del> Done.\r\n- <del>Use full RGBA channels.</del> Not critical now.\r\n- <del>Don't let height always be 1. The reason is that OpenGL textures have stupid size limitations. For example, you can have a 2500x2500 2D texture but not a 6250000x1 2D texture. One possible way is just let height be the maximum supported value.</del> Not critical now.\r\n- Go through the AST to properly do codegen.\r\n- <del>Don't fuse reduction.</del> Gemm runnable.\r\n- <del>Fix argument name generation.</del> Done.\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-26T20:33:15Z","updated_at":"2018-01-20T21:51:34Z","closed_at":"2018-01-20T21:51:34Z","merged_at":"2018-01-20T21:51:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"700949676ef3cdcc7b830da8b27274e90a4564d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/672/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/672/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/672/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/8b98b59aa7339b278dc460a17c6b45c2b41cdf83","head":{"label":"phisiart:opengl","ref":"opengl","sha":"8b98b59aa7339b278dc460a17c6b45c2b41cdf83","user":{"login":"phisiart","id":4835507,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzU1MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4835507?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart","html_url":"https://github.com/phisiart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108062490,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDgwNjI0OTA=","name":"tvm","full_name":"phisiart/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phisiart","id":4835507,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzU1MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4835507?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart","html_url":"https://github.com/phisiart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phisiart/tvm","description":"Always
