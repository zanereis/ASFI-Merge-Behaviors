commit replaces instances of 'size() == 0' with 'isEmpty()' in relevant code files. The change is aimed at:\r\n\r\n1. Improving code readability: 'isEmpty()' is more expressive and clearly indicates the intent.\r\n2. Enhancing performance: 'isEmpty()' is generally an O(1) operation, whereas 'size() == 0' can be O(n) for some data structures.\r\n\r\nThis is an internal code optimization and does not affect the external API or functionality.\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-12T21:32:11Z","updated_at":"2023-10-19T19:42:30Z","closed_at":"2023-10-19T19:42:30Z","merged_at":"2023-10-19T19:42:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"c37247ab5ee81b4b45770f71e9ce0e91035c8ac1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"juanpablo-santos","id":1218530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTg1MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1218530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos","html_url":"https://github.com/juanpablo-santos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/pulls/314/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/pulls/314/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/314/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/statuses/e2f0bf68edacbe5a00a7852e7a9f7fa9b0a670ca","head":{"label":"arturobernalg:isEmpty","ref":"isEmpty","sha":"e2f0bf68edacbe5a00a7852e7a9f7fa9b0a670ca","user":{"login":"arturobernalg","id":4700574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDA1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4700574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg","html_url":"https://github.com/arturobernalg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":318992380,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTg5OTIzODA=","name":"jspwiki","full_name":"arturobernalg/jspwiki","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arturobernalg","id":4700574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDA1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4700574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg","html_url":"https://github.com/arturobernalg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arturobernalg/jspwiki","description":"Apache

If alphabetical ordering is desired, this can be addressed in a separate ticket. In my opinion, that would be the appropriate course of action.","created_at":"2023-10-08T16:17:22Z","updated_at":"2023-10-11T18:10:56Z","closed_at":"2023-10-11T18:10:55Z","merged_at":"2023-10-11T18:10:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"59f1678bf4aedbea2f7d94ee8397478ed2a016d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"metskem","id":555693,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTY5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/555693?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metskem","html_url":"https://github.com/metskem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metskem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metskem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metskem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metskem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metskem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metskem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metskem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metskem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metskem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/pulls/312/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/pulls/312/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/312/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/statuses/0e703223906e31b1b3c77d7e68d2563b598335ac","head":{"label":"arturobernalg:JSPWIKI-925","ref":"JSPWIKI-925","sha":"0e703223906e31b1b3c77d7e68d2563b598335ac","user":{"login":"arturobernalg","id":4700574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDA1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4700574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg","html_url":"https://github.com/arturobernalg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":318992380,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTg5OTIzODA=","name":"jspwiki","full_name":"arturobernalg/jspwiki","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arturobernalg","id":4700574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDA1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4700574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg","html_url":"https://github.com/arturobernalg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arturobernalg/jspwiki","description":"Apache

commit addresses an issue in the ParamTag class where, if the parent tag was not an instance of ParamHandler, an infinite loop would occur. This was due to the 'getParent()' method always returning the same object.\r\n\r\nThe fix involves getting the parent of the current tag in the loop, thereby ensuring that we keep moving up the tree until we find a parent that is a ParamHandler or until we run out of parents. This prevents the possibility of an infinite loop and provides a more robust handling of the tag structure.","created_at":"2023-06-23T17:07:12Z","updated_at":"2023-08-11T06:22:43Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"71623e5cfda061fb4572c5c69dc435ced038a0aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/pulls/289/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/pulls/289/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/289/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/statuses/e3794f4e5e8867db564110abe4a8f0a68394b34b","head":{"label":"arturobernalg:JSPWIKI-388","ref":"JSPWIKI-388","sha":"e3794f4e5e8867db564110abe4a8f0a68394b34b","user":{"login":"arturobernalg","id":4700574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDA1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4700574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg","html_url":"https://github.com/arturobernalg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":318992380,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTg5OTIzODA=","name":"jspwiki","full_name":"arturobernalg/jspwiki","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arturobernalg","id":4700574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDA1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4700574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg","html_url":"https://github.com/arturobernalg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arturobernalg/jspwiki","description":"Apache

pull request addresses the issue [JSPWIKI-1172](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JSPWIKI-1172) by changing the default value of jspwiki.workDir from java.io.tmpdir to the servlet container's context-specific temp directory, as provided by the \"javax.servlet.context.tempdir\" context attribute.\r\n\r\nKey Changes:\r\n\r\n-  A new ServletContextListener, WikiServletContextListener, has been created to manage this setting during context initialization.\r\n-  In case the servlet container does not provide a temporary directory, the system's default temporary directory is used as a fallback.\r\n- This modification aids in avoiding possible problems associated with space limitations in the system's temporary directory, especially on Unix systems where /tmp is often space-limited and sometimes located in a ramdisk.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n\r\n- Unit tests have been added for the new WikiServletContextListener to ensure the directory is set correctly during context initialization, and that an exception is thrown if the directory is not writable.\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-03T21:26:25Z","updated_at":"2023-07-29T20:57:12Z","closed_at":"2023-07-29T20:56:31Z","merged_at":"2023-07-29T20:56:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"f1cb2f633a792d58aff3d864c5e75ca9a619f86e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4346577562,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ07c8AAAABAxOCmg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/labels/reviewed/changes-requested","name":"reviewed/changes-requested","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/pulls/282/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/pulls/282/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/282/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/statuses/28feea10ff8a379fa9c7e7c23714121cea8d7c39","head":{"label":"arturobernalg:feature/JSPWIKI-1172","ref":"feature/JSPWIKI-1172","sha":"28feea10ff8a379fa9c7e7c23714121cea8d7c39","user":{"login":"arturobernalg","id":4700574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDA1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4700574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg","html_url":"https://github.com/arturobernalg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":318992380,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTg5OTIzODA=","name":"jspwiki","full_name":"arturobernalg/jspwiki","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arturobernalg","id":4700574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDA1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4700574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg","html_url":"https://github.com/arturobernalg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturobernalg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arturobernalg/jspwiki","description":"Apache
