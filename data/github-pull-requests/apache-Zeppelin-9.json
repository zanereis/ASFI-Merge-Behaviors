HOME=/opt/zeppelin -e ZEPPELIN_HELIUM_REGISTRY=helium,https://s3.amazonaws.com/helium-package/helium.json apache/zeppelin:0.9.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the error message is not very intuitive and it may take lots of time to find a solution.\r\nSo, I think it make sense to set the HOME env variable in Dockerfile.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5167\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nReproduce the problem by running Zeppelin from the latest docker image without the HOME env variable.\r\nAnd try to install a visualization package from Helium menu\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run -p8080:8080 --rm -e ZEPPELIN_HELIUM_REGISTRY=helium,https://s3.amazonaws.com/helium-package/helium.json apache/zeppelin:0.9.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then test with HOME environment variable, and verify visualization package is installed without error.\r\n```\r\ndocker run -p8080:8080 --rm -e HOME=/opt/zeppelin -e ZEPPELIN_HELIUM_REGISTRY=helium,https://s3.amazonaws.com/helium-package/helium.json apache/zeppelin:0.9.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\nThe pyspark bootstrap script is missing some java imports that are in the native Spark bootstrapping. (See https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/pyspark/java_gateway.py#L152). This prevents some of the SQL functions from working correctly, most notably `.explain()`, in pyspark. This adds the imports that are missing from the built-in spark implementation.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5275\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nI added a check to make sure `.explain` works in the pyspark test, but I can't actually get that test to run locally (it just hangs running the simple `sc.range(1,10).sum()`, not sure why.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-03T11:28:22Z","updated_at":"2021-03-12T07:22:23Z","closed_at":"2021-03-12T07:22:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d6d2ff2e0999b9582a03148c7b4fad3731cddf75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4067/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4067/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4067/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/f2aa0481779f7be1797364b2ab4cad8b882455f3","head":{"label":"Kimahriman:bug/pyspark-java-imports","ref":"bug/pyspark-java-imports","sha":"f2aa0481779f7be1797364b2ab4cad8b882455f3","user":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":338847522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDc1MjI=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"Kimahriman/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple fix for the issue described in [ZEPPELIN-5192](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5192): Zeppelin will currently fail to start if a credentials encryption key is configured but no `credentials.json` file exists currently. This is due to an NPE inside the decryption code path. The fix is to only attempt the decryption if the file could be loaded.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\n[Bug Fix]\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-5192](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5192)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nBooting a fresh Zeppelin server with ZEPPELIN_CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPT_KEY set is

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR aims to add support for Knox groups in ShiroAuthenticationService.getAssociatedRoles. This allows Knox realm groups (which uses hadoop groups under the hood) to be used for things like the Notebook API that doesn't use native Shiro group checks.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I removed some unused parts of the Knox realm. I can undo this if desired, but I figured I would clean it up since it's not used.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5258\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nAdded new UT and tested manually\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

would you review please? thank you\r\n\r\n### What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR fixes issue for search command in Elasticsearch as it is not working now. This is rather a serious problem as right now, ES interpreter is more or less useless when one can not search in it so it would be awesome if it is merged as not doing so renders that plugin useless. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that in the past, there was this in the response from a server on search:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"took\": 1,\r\n    \"timed_out\": false,\r\n    \"_shards\": {\r\n        \"total\": 1,\r\n        \"successful\": 1,\r\n        \"skipped\": 0,\r\n        \"failed\": 0\r\n    },\r\n    \"hits\": {\r\n        \"total\": 1\r\n     },\r\n/// other fields omitted for brevity\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut now it returns:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"took\": 1,\r\n    \"timed_out\": false,\r\n    \"_shards\": {\r\n        \"total\": 1,\r\n        \"successful\": 1,\r\n        \"skipped\": 0,\r\n        \"failed\": 0\r\n    },\r\n    \"hits\": {\r\n        \"total\": {\r\n            \"value\": 1,\r\n            \"relation\": \"eq\"\r\n        },\r\n/// other fields omitted for brevity\r\n```\r\nThis changed behaviour seems to be introduced in recent ES versions 7.x, I do not have any capability to check how far into the past this issue is present, I have done it in such a way that it is backward-compatible with older versions too.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix.\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nZEPPELIN-4843\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* I have run unit tests in Java for ES interpreter, they all worked.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? - no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? - no, the older version is still supported, the solution works as it was but it fallbacks to new way of doing things for more recent ES versions.\r\n* Does this needs documentation? - no\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-20T18:31:13Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T15:45:55Z","closed_at":"2021-03-01T07:00:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9b0b3b699140010831d9132e50ff3c613393533e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4057/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4057/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4057/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/a4ad3da03e221ca7e6a14cb2e00a298bb3bed3ba","head":{"label":"smiklosovic:ZEPPELIN-4843","ref":"ZEPPELIN-4843","sha":"a4ad3da03e221ca7e6a14cb2e00a298bb3bed3ba","user":{"login":"smiklosovic","id":588603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODYwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/588603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic","html_url":"https://github.com/smiklosovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":340689198,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA2ODkxOTg=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"smiklosovic/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"smiklosovic","id":588603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODYwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/588603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic","html_url":"https://github.com/smiklosovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/smiklosovic/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\nLivy Interpreter doesn't support Japanese Character - Encoding Issue\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix]\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5231\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nOn a paragraph use below to generate data set:\r\n```\r\n%livy.scala\r\nspark.sql(\"CREATE TABLE  test ( id int, name String, destination String)\")\r\nspark.sql(\"INSERT INTO test VALUES ('1', 'みんく', 'みんく')\")\r\nspark.sql(\"INSERT INTO test VALUES ('2', 'シュレヤン', 'シュレヤン')\")\r\nspark.sql(\"INSERT INTO test VALUES ('3', 'サイ', 'サイ')\")\r\nspark.sql(\"INSERT INTO test VALUES ('4', 'ツェッペリン', 'ツェッペリン')\")\r\nspark.sql(\"INSERT INTO test VALUES ('5', 'テスト', 'テスト')\")\r\nspark.sql(\"INSERT INTO test VALUES ('6', 'チャラン', 'チャラン')\")\r\nspark.sql(\"select * from test\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in a separate paragraph use this to verify:\r\n```\r\n%livy.sql\r\nselect * from test\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou would notice that on toggling (true/false) between the newly introduced `tableWithUTFCharacter` the same 2nd paragraph works.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?N/A\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?N/A\r\n* Does this needs documentation?N/A\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-02T17:53:26Z","updated_at":"2022-05-02T16:29:10Z","closed_at":"2021-02-10T02:26:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5668b503fe269bcde480c73fe9de634a6e80a4e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4041/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4041/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4041/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/26b8c03d669b90e1526080a5bf583a0aaae46f15","head":{"label":"prabhjyotsingh:ZEPPELIN-5231","ref":"ZEPPELIN-5231","sha":"26b8c03d669b90e1526080a5bf583a0aaae46f15","user":{"login":"prabhjyotsingh","id":674497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDQ5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh","html_url":"https://github.com/prabhjyotsingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44664903,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDY2NDkwMw==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"prabhjyotsingh/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"prabhjyotsingh","id":674497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDQ5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh","html_url":"https://github.com/prabhjyotsingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/prabhjyotsingh/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

Because it doesn't make sense to run spark-submit in the same JVM of spark interpreter. It would cause some very confused things. e.g. If running it in yarn mode, the yarn app would never be registered unless SparkContext is created. But if you only `%spark.submit`, SparkContext would never be created.  \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[ Refactoring]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5213\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Manually tested\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nBug Fix: get `authType` using `getProperty` instead of `jdbcUserConfigurations.getPropertyMap(dbPrefix).getProperty`.\r\n\r\nAccording to the JDBC Interpreter document (https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/interpreter/jdbc.md), we should use `zeppelin.jdbc.auth.type`, but It is observed in the JDBC Interpreter that:\r\n- Setting `zeppelin.jdbc.auth.type`  to `KERBEROS` didn't work\r\n- Setting `default.zeppelin.jdbc.auth.type`  to `KERBEROS` works\r\n\r\nIn `protected boolean isKerboseEnabled()`, we use `getProperty(\"zeppelin.jdbc.auth.type\")`, but in `public Connection getConnection(String dbPrefix, InterpreterContext context)`, `jdbcUserConfigurations.getPropertyMap(dbPrefix).getProperty(\"zeppelin.jdbc.auth.type\", \"SIMPLE\")` was used. \r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Make
