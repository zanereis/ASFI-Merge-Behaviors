contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [ ] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [ ] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [ ] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [ ] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [ ] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2417\">#2417</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.26.1 - 13 Aug 2024</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.0 - 06 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> Swift analysis on Ubuntu runner images is no longer supported.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> Swift analysis on Ubuntu runner images is no longer supported. Please migrate to a macOS runner if this affects you. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2403\">#2403</a></li>\n<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2408\">#2408</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.15 - 26 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2385\">#2385</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.14 - 25 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Experimental: add a new <code>start-proxy</code> action which starts the same HTTP proxy as used by <a href=\"https://github.com/github/dependabot-action\"><code>github/dependabot-action</code></a>. Do not use this in production as it is part of an internal experiment and subject to change at any time. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2376\">#2376</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.13 - 19 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>codeql-version</code> to outputs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2368\">#2368</a></li>\n<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.13.4 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 9 July 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.26.0 and later and versions 2.26.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2375\">#2375</a>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.13.5 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.12.6 and 2.13.4, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.25.13</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.25.13</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.12 - 12 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the reliability and performance of analyzing code when analyzing a compiled language with the <code>autobuild</code> <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#codeql-build-modes\">build mode</a> on GitHub Enterprise Server.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [ ] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [ ] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [ ] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

of #1582\r\nFixes warnings and missed items discovered by replacing\r\n`SimplePrincipalCollection` with `ImmutablePrincipalCollection` inside core\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [x] fix test deprecations\r\n- [x] move code from #1582 to assertj\r\n- [x] check the rest of the code besides core/\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

[github/codeql-action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action) from 3.25.14 to 3.25.15.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.15 - 26 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2385\">#2385</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.14 - 25 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Experimental: add a new <code>start-proxy</code> action which starts the same HTTP proxy as used by <a href=\"https://github.com/github/dependabot-action\"><code>github/dependabot-action</code></a>. Do not use this in production as it is part of an internal experiment and subject to change at any time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.13 - 19 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>codeql-version</code> to outputs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2368\">#2368</a></li>\n<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.13.4 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 9 July 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.26.0 and later and versions 2.26.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2375\">#2375</a>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.13.5 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.12.6 and 2.13.4, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.25.13</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.25.13</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.12 - 12 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the reliability and performance of analyzing code when analyzing a compiled language with the <code>autobuild</code> <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#codeql-build-modes\">build mode</a> on GitHub Enterprise Server. This feature is already available to GitHub.com users. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2353\">#2353</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.0. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2364\">#2364</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.11 - 28 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid failing the workflow run if there is an error while uploading debug artifacts. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2349\">#2349</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.6. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2352\">#2352</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.10 - 13 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2327\">#2327</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.9 - 12 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid failing database creation if the database folder already exists and contains some unexpected files. Requires CodeQL 2.18.0 or higher. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2330\">#2330</a></li>\n<li>The init Action will attempt to clean up the database cluster directory before creating a new database and at the end of the job. This will help to avoid issues where the database cluster directory is left in an inconsistent state. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2332\">#2332</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.8 - 04 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2321\">#2321</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.7 - 31 May 2024</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[github/codeql-action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action) from 3.25.13 to 3.25.14.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2385\">#2385</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.14 - 25 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Experimental: add a new <code>start-proxy</code> action which starts the same HTTP proxy as used by <a href=\"https://github.com/github/dependabot-action\"><code>github/dependabot-action</code></a>. Do not use this in production as it is part of an internal experiment and subject to change at any time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.13 - 19 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>codeql-version</code> to outputs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2368\">#2368</a></li>\n<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.13.4 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 9 July 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.26.0 and later and versions 2.26.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2375\">#2375</a>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.13.5 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.12.6 and 2.13.4, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.25.13</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.25.13</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.12 - 12 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the reliability and performance of analyzing code when analyzing a compiled language with the <code>autobuild</code> <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#codeql-build-modes\">build mode</a> on GitHub Enterprise Server. This feature is already available to GitHub.com users. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2353\">#2353</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.0. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2364\">#2364</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.11 - 28 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid failing the workflow run if there is an error while uploading debug artifacts. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2349\">#2349</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.6. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2352\">#2352</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.10 - 13 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2327\">#2327</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.9 - 12 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid failing database creation if the database folder already exists and contains some unexpected files.

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.13 - 19 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>codeql-version</code> to outputs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2368\">#2368</a></li>\n<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.13.4 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 9 July 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.26.0 and later and versions 2.26.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2375\">#2375</a>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.13.5 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.12.6 and 2.13.4, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.25.13</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.25.13</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.12 - 12 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the reliability and performance of analyzing code when analyzing a compiled language with the <code>autobuild</code> <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#codeql-build-modes\">build mode</a> on GitHub Enterprise Server. This feature is already available to GitHub.com users. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2353\">#2353</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.0. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2364\">#2364</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.11 - 28 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid failing the workflow run if there is an error while uploading debug artifacts. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2349\">#2349</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.6. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2352\">#2352</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.10 - 13 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2327\">#2327</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.9 - 12 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid failing database creation if the database folder already exists and contains some unexpected files. Requires CodeQL 2.18.0 or higher. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2330\">#2330</a></li>\n<li>The init Action will attempt to clean up the database cluster directory before creating a new database and at the end of the job. This will help to avoid issues where the database cluster directory is left in an inconsistent state. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2332\">#2332</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.8 - 04 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2321\">#2321</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.7 - 31 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in May/June 2024 that will reduce the Actions cache usage of the Action by keeping only the newest TRAP cache for each language. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2306\">#2306</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.6 - 20 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2295\">#2295</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.5 - 13 May 2024</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.12 - 12 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the reliability and performance of analyzing code when analyzing a compiled language with the <code>autobuild</code> <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#codeql-build-modes\">build mode</a> on GitHub Enterprise Server. This feature is already available to GitHub.com users. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2353\">#2353</a></li>\n<li>Add <code>codeql-version</code> to outputs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2368\">#2368</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.0. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2364\">#2364</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.11 - 28 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid failing the workflow run if there is an error while uploading debug artifacts. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2349\">#2349</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.6. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2352\">#2352</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.10 - 13 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2327\">#2327</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.9 - 12 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid failing database creation if the database folder already exists and contains some unexpected files. Requires CodeQL 2.18.0 or higher. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2330\">#2330</a></li>\n<li>The init Action will attempt to clean up the database cluster directory before creating a new database and at the end of the job. This will help to avoid issues where the database cluster directory is left in an inconsistent state. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2332\">#2332</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.8 - 04 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2321\">#2321</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.7 - 31 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in May/June 2024 that will reduce the Actions cache usage of the Action by keeping only the newest TRAP cache for each language. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2306\">#2306</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.6 - 20 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2295\">#2295</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.5 - 13 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a compatibility matrix of supported CodeQL Action, CodeQL CLI, and GitHub Enterprise Server versions to the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md\">https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2273\">#2273</a></li>\n<li>Avoid printing out a warning for a missing <code>on.push</code> trigger when the CodeQL Action is triggered via a <code>workflow_call</code> event. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2274\">#2274</a></li>\n<li>The <code>tools: latest</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action has been renamed to <code>tools: linked</code>. This option specifies that the Action should use the tools shipped at the same time as the Action.

The URL encoding process has been improved to handle these characters\ncorrectly. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2142\">2142</a></li>\n<li>When using <code>W3CDom</code> with a custom output Document, a Null Pointer Exception would be\nthrown. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2114\">2114</a></li>\n<li>The <code>:has()</code> selector did not match correctly when using sibling combinators (like\ne.g.: <code>h1:has(+h2)</code>). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2137\">2137</a></li>\n<li>The <code>:empty</code> selector incorrectly matched elements that started with a blank text node and were followed by\nnon-empty nodes, due to an incorrect short-circuit. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2130\">2130</a></li>\n<li><code>Element.cssSelector()</code> would fail with &quot;Did not find balanced marker&quot; when building a selector for elements that had\na <code>(</code> or <code>[</code> in their class names. And selectors with those characters escaped would not match as\nexpected. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2146\">2146</a></li>\n<li>Updated <code>Entities.escape(string)</code> to make the escaped text suitable for both text nodes and attributes (previously was\nonly for text nodes). This does not impact the output of <code>Element.html()</code> which correctly applies a minimal escape\ndepending on if the use will be for text data or in a quoted\nattribute. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1278\">1278</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case,
