It is used to count only fetch requests received by broker instance that originated from clients (and not from replicas). This allows us to tell whether the topic is being actively consumed (not only synchronized from replicas).\r\n\r\n**Testing strategy:**\r\nWe want to verify that correct metric is growing depending on whether the partitions hosted by given broker instance are being read from (by clients).\r\n\r\nHave a cluster with 2+ nodes (needed for replication).\r\n\r\na1) Create a topic with replication factor = 1.\r\na2) Observe that `ConsumerFetchRequestsPerSec` does not change value (noone is consuming).\r\na3) Start a consumer reading from that topic. Observe that `ConsumerFetchRequestsPerSec` grows.\r\na4) Stop the consumer. Observe that `ConsumerFetchRequestsPerSec` is no longer growing.\r\n\r\nb1) Create a topic with replication factor >= 2.\r\nb2) Observe that `ConsumerFetchRequestsPerSec` is not changing value.

PR supersedes PR #4654 as it was growing too large. All comments in that PR should be addressed here.\r\n I will attempt to break the PRs for the topology optimization effort into 3 PRs total and will follow this general plan:\r\n\r\n1. This PR only adds the graph nodes and graph. The graph nodes will hold the information used to make calls to the `InternalTopologyBuilder` when using the DSL. Graph nodes are stored in the `StreamsTopologyGraph` until the final topology needs building then the graph is traversed and optimizations are made at that point.  There are no tests in this PR relying on the follow-up PR to use all current streams tests, which should suffice.\r\n2. PR 2 will intercept all DSL calls and build the graph.  The `InternalStreamsBuilder` uses the graph to provide the required info to the `InternalTopologyBuilder` and build a topology.  The condition of satisfaction for this PR is that all current unit, integration and system tests pass using the graph.\r\n3. PR 3 adds some optimizations mainly automatically repartitioning for operations that may modify a key and have child operations that would normally create a separate repartition topic, saving possible unnecessary repartition topics.  For example the following topology:\r\n```\r\nKStream<String, String> mappedStreamOther = inputStream.map(new KeyValueMapper<String, String, KeyValue<? extends String, ? extends String>>() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public KeyValue<? extends String, ? extends String> apply(String key, String value) {\r\n\r\n                return KeyValue.pair(key.substring(0, 3), value);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n\r\n        mappedStreamOther.groupByKey().windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(5000)).count().toStream().to(\"count-one-out\");\r\n        mappedStreamOther.groupByKey().windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(10000)).count().toStream().to(\"count-two-out\");\r\n        mappedStreamOther.groupByKey().windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(15000)).count().toStream().to(\"count-three-out\");\r\n```\r\nwould create 3 repartion topics, but after applying an optimization strategy, only one is created.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-24T21:36:06Z","updated_at":"2018-05-04T15:39:57Z","closed_at":"2018-05-04T15:39:57Z","merged_at":"2018-05-04T15:39:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"515ce21c74743171df6cb069b4754f68fe7f2233","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4923/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4923/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/4923/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/4f05b759f69d61379d9eec057d336adb3dd3e765","head":{"label":"bbejeck:KAFKA-6761_reduce_footprint_part_1","ref":"KAFKA-6761_reduce_footprint_part_1","sha":"4f05b759f69d61379d9eec057d336adb3dd3e765","user":{"login":"bbejeck","id":199238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTIzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/199238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck","html_url":"https://github.com/bbejeck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42054236,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjA1NDIzNg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"bbejeck/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bbejeck","id":199238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTIzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/199238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck","html_url":"https://github.com/bbejeck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bbejeck/kafka","description":"Mirror

breaking KAFKA-6813 into a couple of \"smaller\" PRs and this is the first one. It focused on:\r\n\r\n1. Remove deprecated APIs in KStream, KTable, KGroupedStream, KGroupedTable, SessionWindowedKStream, TimeWindowedKStream.\r\n\r\n2. Also found a couple of overlooked bugs while working on them:\r\n\r\n2.a) In KTable.filter / mapValues without the additional parameter indicating the materialized stores, originally we will not materialize the store. After KIP-182 we mistakenly diverge the semantics: for KTable.mapValues it is still the case, for KTable.filter we will always materialize.\r\n\r\n2.b) In XXStream/Table.reduce/count, we used to try to reuse the serdes since their types are pre-known (for `reduce` it is the same types for both key / value, for `count` it is the same types for key, and `Long` for value). This was somehow lost in the past refactoring.\r\n\r\n2.c) We are enforcing to cast a `Serde<V>` to `Serde<VR>` for XXStream / Table.aggregate, for which the returned value type is NOT known, such the enforced casting should not be applied and we should require users to provide us the value serde if they believe the default ones are not applicable.\r\n\r\n2.d) Whenever we are creating a new `MaterializedInternal` we are effectively incrementing the suffix index for the store / processor-node names. However in some places this `MaterializedInternal` is only used for validation, so the resulted processor-node / store suffix is not monotonic.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-24T06:23:42Z","updated_at":"2020-04-24T23:57:12Z","closed_at":"2018-05-08T00:34:35Z","merged_at":"2018-05-08T00:34:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"2b5a59406622affa1e333e073546f075f59b4ac9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4919/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4919/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/4919/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/52b7257a5b75a831530a76548620be9f546948a7","head":{"label":"guozhangwang:K6813-Kip120-Kip182-deprecated","ref":"K6813-Kip120-Kip182-deprecated","sha":"52b7257a5b75a831530a76548620be9f546948a7","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39164613,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTE2NDYxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"guozhangwang/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka","description":"Mirror

unit tests for ReplicaAlterLogDirsThread. Mostly focused on unit tests for truncating logic.\r\n\r\nFixed  ReplicaAlterLogDirsThread.buildLeaderEpochRequest() to use future replica's latest epoch (not the latest epoch of replica it is fetching from). This follows the logic that offset for leader epoch request should be based on leader epoch of the follower (in this case it's the future local replica). \r\n\r\nAlso fixed PartitionFetchState constructor that takes offset and delay. The code ignored the delay parameter and used 0 for the delay. This constructor is used only by another constructor which passes delay = 0, which luckily works. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [x] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-24T03:48:54Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T21:49:53Z","closed_at":"2018-04-25T21:27:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a87b789c443d3e8d0c3afe2580ab697368032b09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4918/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4918/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/4918/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/d0bc4a114dadacbac464f471cd95538eca95aae0","head":{"label":"apovzner:kafka-6795","ref":"kafka-6795","sha":"d0bc4a114dadacbac464f471cd95538eca95aae0","user":{"login":"apovzner","id":5383840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODM4NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5383840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner","html_url":"https://github.com/apovzner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44782457,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDc4MjQ1Nw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"apovzner/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apovzner","id":5383840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODM4NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5383840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner","html_url":"https://github.com/apovzner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apovzner/kafka","description":"Mirror

Fixes a bug in which all NamedCache instances in a process shared\r\none parent metric.\r\n\r\n* Also fixes a bug which incorrectly computed the per-cache metric tag\r\n(which was undetected due to the former bug).\r\n\r\n* Drop the `StreamsMetricsConventions#xLevelSensorName` convention\r\nin favor of `StreamsMetricsImpl#xLevelSensor` to allow `StreamsMetricsImpl`\r\nto track thread- and cache-level metrics, so that they may be cleanly declared\r\nfrom anywhere but still unloaded at the appropriate time. This was necessary\r\nright now so that the `NamedCache` could register a thread-level parent sensor\r\nto be unloaded when the thread, not the cache, is closed.\r\n\r\n* The above changes made it mostly unnecessary for the `StreamsMetricsImpl` to\r\nexpose a reference to the underlying `Metrics` registry, so I did a little extra work\r\nto remove that reference, including removing inconsistently-used and unnecessary\r\ncalls to `Metrics#close()` in the tests.\r\n\r\nThe existing tests should be sufficient to verify this change.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

directory in the plugin.path is monitored for file system changes via a daemon thread, and when a change is detected that appears to correspond to a plugin creation (e.g., a directory or archive file is created), the DelegatingClassLoader is alerted and scans the location for new plugins to register.\r\n\r\nPlugin removals currently only result in a warning, since once they are loaded by the DelegatingClassLoader, deletion of the corresponding .class, .zip, or .jar files does not remove them from the class loader.\r\n\r\nTesting involves creating a directory, populating it with several fake plugins, and watching it with a `PluginPathDirectoryListener`. At that point, several more fake plugins are created, and it is verified that their creation has been detected by the listener. Afterward, some fake plugins are deleted, and it is verified that their deletion has been detected by the listener. A \"red herring\" file is also created and deleted during the test, and it is verified that that file is not acknowledged by the listener. All current plugin formats are included in the test (directory, JAR file, and ZIP file).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

any clues as to how this could have occurred.\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR changes the log level from `INFO` to `WARN` when metadata does not have partitions for a given topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer

if the client sends a produce request or a fetch request to a broker which isn't a replica, we return UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION. This is a bit surprising to see when the topic actually exists. It would be better to return NOT_LEADER to avoid confusion. Clients typically handle both errors by refreshing metadata and retrying, so changing this should not cause any change in behavior on the client. This case can be hit following a partition reassignment after the leader is moved and the local replica is deleted.\r\n\r\nTo validate the current behavior and the fix, I've added  integration tests for the fetch and produce APIs.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

the return types in consumer group APIs the following way:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMap<TopicPartition, KafkaFuture<Void>> DeleteConsumerGroupsResult#deletedGroups()\r\n\r\nMap<TopicPartition, KafkaFuture<ConsumerGroupDescription>> DescribeConsumerGroupsResult#describedGroups()\r\n\r\nKafkaFuture<Collection<ConsumerGroupListing>> ListConsumerGroupsResult#listings()\r\n\r\nKafkaFuture<Map<TopicPartition, OffsetAndMetadata>> ListConsumerGroupOffsetsResult#partitionsToOffsetAndMetadata()\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. For DeleteConsumerGroupsResult and DescribeConsumerGroupsResult, for each group id we have two round-trips to get the coordinator, and then send the delete / describe request; I leave the potential optimization of batching requests for future work.\r\n\r\n2. For ListConsumerGroupOffsetsResult, it is a simple single round-trip and hence the whole map is wrapped as a Future.\r\n\r\n3. ListConsumerGroupsResult, it is the most tricky one: we would only know how many futures we should wait for after the first listNode returns, and hence I constructed the flattened future in the middle wrapped with the underlying map of futures.\r\n\r\n3.a Another big change I made is, we do not return the exception in the flattened future if only a few of the nodes returns ERROR code, and instead just return the rest of the listings; to use that I added a new `anyOf` function in `KafkaFuture`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

the new stricter-timeout version of `poll` proposed in KIP-266.\r\n\r\nThe pre-existing variant `poll(long timeout)` would block indefinitely for metadata\r\nupdates if they were needed, then it would issue a fetch and poll for `timeout` ms \r\nfor new records. The initial indefinite metadata block caused applications to become\r\nstuck when the brokers became unavailable. The existence of the timeout parameter\r\nmade the indefinite block especially unintuitive.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `poll(Duration timeout)` with the semantics:\r\n1. iff a metadata update is needed:\r\n    1. send (asynchronous) metadata requests\r\n    2. poll for metadata responses (counts against timeout)\r\n        - if no response within timeout, **return an empty collection immediately**\r\n2. if there is fetch data available, **return it immediately**\r\n3. if there is no fetch request in flight, send fetch requests\r\n4. poll for fetch responses (counts against timeout)\r\n    - if no response within timeout, **return an empty collection** (leaving async fetch request for the next poll)\r\n    - if we get a response, **return the response**\r\n\r\nThe old method, `poll(long timeout)` is deprecated, but we do not change its semantics, so it remains:\r\n1. iff a metadata update is needed:\r\n    1. send (asynchronous) metadata requests\r\n    2. poll for metadata responses *indefinitely until we get it*\r\n2. if there is fetch data available, **return it immediately**\r\n3. if there is no fetch request in flight, send fetch requests\r\n4. poll for fetch responses (counts against timeout)\r\n    - if no response within timeout, **return an empty collection** (leaving async fetch request for the next poll)\r\n    - if we get a response, **return the response**\r\n\r\nOne notable usage is prohibited by the new `poll`: previously, you could call `poll(0)` to block for metadata updates, for example to initialize the client, supposedly without fetching records. Note, though, that this behavior is not according to any contract, and there is no guarantee that `poll(0)` won't return records the first time it's called. Therefore, it has always been unsafe to ignore the response.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and
