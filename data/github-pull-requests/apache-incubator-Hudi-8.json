Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR migrates the integration tests from running on Spark 2.4 to running on Spark 3.5.  Changes include:\r\n- Fixes `hudi-hive-sync-bundle` to include necessary jackson and parquet classes in the bundle to avoid missing or conflicted classes in Hive sync;\r\n- Fixes `hudi-sync/hudi-hive-sync/run_sync_tool.sh` to avoid jackson dependency conflict;\r\n- Changes configurations of `integration-tests` task in `.github/workflows/bot.yml` to run on Spark 3.5;\r\n- Changes docker demo setup to use Spark 3.5, rebuilds and uploads new images (for `linux/amd64` architecture only in this PR);\r\n  - `Dockerfile`s are changed.  Debian stretch release is no longer supported.  Debian bullseye release is used instead as the base.\r\n  - Spark 3.5.3 is used in docker images that need Spark.\r\n- Changes to `hudi-aws/pom.xml` so that we can pull the `moto` image based on the correct architecture.  `apachehudi/moto image` is uploaded.  Moto port is changed so it can run locally on the Macbook to avoid port collision;\r\n- Changes the way of checking open port in `ITTestBase#checkHealth` based on the new output;\r\n- Re-enables `ITTestHoodieDem#testParquetDemo` to verify that Spark job and queries work fine in the new docker demo setup;\r\n  - A few issues unrelated to the upgrade are discovered (since the docker demo test was disabled for a while after #9823) which will be tackled separately: HUDI-8269, HUDI-8270, HUDI-8271, HUDI-8272, HUDI-8273, HUDI-8275\r\n  - Fixes validation logic because of behavior change in meta sync and output format change in Spark;\r\n- Disables ITs in `ITTestHoodieSanity` and `ITTestHoodieSyncCommand` which are already covered by other tests (HUDI-8274 to revisit).\r\n\r\nNew docker images (tagged `latest` and `bullseye` for hudi-hadoop images) are uploaded to the Docker Hub:\r\n- `apachehudi/moto`\r\n- `apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-base`\r\n- `apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-datanode`\r\n- `apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-history`\r\n- `apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-hive_2.3.3`\r\n- `apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-hive_2.3.3-sparkbase_3.5.3`\r\n- `apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-hive_2.3.3-sparkadhoc_3.5.3`\r\n- `apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-hive_2.3.3-sparkmaster_3.5.3`\r\n- `apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-hive_2.3.3-sparkworker_3.5.3`\r\n\r\nOld images under the same names are pushed to a different tag, `stretch`, in case we'd like to use that with Spark 2.4.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMakes integration test run on Spark 3.5, to unblock deprecation of Spark 2 integration in Hudi.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Fix Log record reading with rollback blocks having higher timestamps compared to maxInstant configured. This fix is required only for 0.x branch. Since with 1.x, we would have ordered log files based on completion time within a file slice. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nLogRecordReader takes in a maxInstant time beyond which log blocks are ignored. But w/ rollbacks, there are chances it could lead to data consistency issues. \r\n\r\nLets go through an illustration: \r\n\r\nSay, we have t1.dc, t2.dc and t2.dc crashed mid way.  \r\nCurrent layout is, \r\n```\r\nbase file(t1), lf1(partially committed data w/ t2 as instant time)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we start t5.dc say. just when we start t5.dc, hudi detects pending commit and triggers a rollback. And this rollback will get an instant time of t6 (t6.rb). Note that rollback's commit time is greater than t5 or current ongoing delta commit. \r\nSo, once rollback completes, this is the layout.\r\n```\r\nbase file, lf1(from t2.dc partially failed), lf3 (rollback command block with t6). \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd once t5.dc completes, this is how the layout looks like \r\n```\r\nbase file, lf1(from t2.dc partially failed), lf3 (rollback command block with t6). lf4 (from t5) \r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point in time, when we trigger snapshot read or try to trigger tagLocation w/ global index, maxInstant is set to last entry among commits timeline which is t5. So, while LogRecordReader while processing all log blocks, when it reaches lf3, it detects the timestamp of t6 > t5 (i.e max instant time) and bails out of for loop. So, in essence it may even read lf4 in above scenario. \r\n\r\nThis patch attempts the fix the same. \r\n\r\nFix: \r\nWe only hold the constraint true for any data blocks and relax it for other block types. For eg, any data blocks > max instant time will be ignored. But all rollback blocks are taken into consideration. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe hudi-bot comment of the Azure CI status can contain the status of multiple runs on the same commit (see the screenshot below). Right now Github checks only reflect the status of the first run which is inconsistent in the case of multiple runs. As long as there is one successful CI run on a particular commit, we treat the commit passing CI (there can be flakiness outside the scope of the PR or previously cancelled runs). This PR fixes Azure CI status check to consider such multiple runs on the same commit so the Github checks reflect the correct status of the Azure CI.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"951\" alt=\"Screenshot

Change Logs\r\n\r\nSuppose RLI (record index) is enabled on MOR table, do an insert and then delete a record. When table is not compacted, it is expected that RO (read-optimized) query shows the deleted record, while snapshot query will not. A query with no predicates works fine, but if the query has a predicate on record key field, it will use RLI and RLI always returns the latest snapshot. Hence, this PR fixes the issue by not using RLI for queries other than snapshot queries. The PR adds a new `supportsQueryType(options: Map[String, String])` API in the base class for index support. Different index can implement it differently as and when we add time tavel support for indexes.\r\n \r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFix RO queries with RLI and record key predicate.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nhudi-flink UnitTest uses MockOperatorStateStore as the storage behind the state of KeyedStream. Because MockOperatorStateStore does not consider the key, stateful KeyedStream operators such as BucketAssignFunction are invalid for some tests because MockOperatorStateStore considers all input records to be duplicates, even if the key is different.\r\n\r\nWe added support for KeyedStream operators with MockKeyedStateStore.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low

Change Logs\r\n\r\nExisting Hudi incremental query would scan the entire timeline and handle hollow commits(commits that started but have not completed) along the way. \r\nHudi 1.x supports Instant completion time, providing a more elegant and intuitive completion timeline for incremental queries to leverage. \r\n\r\nThis PR is a part of effort of making incremental query use completion timeline by default\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n`hoodie.read.timeline.holes.resolution.policy` would no longer has effect on `HoodieIncrSource`, `GcsEventsHoodieIncrSource` and `S3EventsHoodieIncrSource`. These sources would always use completion time to find the start instant for incremental query.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n`hoodie.read.timeline.holes.resolution.policy` would no longer has effect on `HoodieIncrSource`, `GcsEventsHoodieIncrSource` and `S3EventsHoodieIncrSource`.\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Avro payload based merging is only used if you set a payload that is not the default payload or the overwrite with latest payload. \r\n\r\nThe filegroup reader now will use payload based merging when the table is configured to use a custom avro payload.\r\n\r\n\r\nFg reader now uses payload based merging if the user uses that on the write side. This leads to consistent results when reading vs compaction\r\n\r\n\r\n### Info for other hudi devs\r\n\r\nBefore you can use the merger configs that a user sets, it needs to go through \r\n```\r\npublic static Triple<RecordMergeMode, String, String> inferCorrectMergingBehavior(RecordMergeMode recordMergeMode, String payloadClassName, String recordMergerStrategy) \r\n```\r\nwhich is currently located in HoodieTableConfig. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-8407 might move this method into the merge config object. \r\n\r\nIf nothing is set then we will default to using event time merging. If the user sets one of the payloads that is default hoodie payload or overwrite payload, then we will use the corresponding merger. If they have a custom payload, we will use the avro record merger which utilizes the payloads to do merging. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nPart of umbrella to simplify merge configs for 1.X\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently when source data has to read in row format and sanitization is enabled, we first read the data in avro format(which supports sanitization) and later convert from avro to row. This new approach simplifies this process by directly converting from json to row while applying sanitization.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWhen source data has to be read in row format, and sanitization is enabled. This change should make the conversion from json to row faster by directly converting from json to row.\r\n\r\nThis change directly affects the existing streams. This is currently added behind a flag which can be disabled if any issues are to be found.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCherry-pick https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/11931 to `branch-0.x`\r\n\r\nI noticed that although the variable for path to auxlib is defined, it is not being used correctly. So running the CLI from repo-root kept redownloading the jakarta jars. The expected `auxlib` points to `<repo_root>/packaging/hudi-cli-bundle/auxlib` as defined in the `$HUDI_AUX_LIB` variable. However, the `wget` kept downloading to `$PWD/auxlib` which is incorrect.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe shared HFile reader in `HoodieNativeAvroHFileReader` uses non-trivial amount of memory (see the screenshots below) and is kept open for reading meta info from the HFile.  This PR adds the changes to avoid keeping the reference to the shared HFile reader by removing the shared HFile reader and caching the meta info by loading the information once, so the memory usage is reduced.\r\n\r\nThis PR also enables the native HFile reader (`_hoodie.hfile.use.native.reader`) by default again.  It was turned off by default before in #11488 due to OOM in CI.\r\n\r\nScreenshots of memory usage of `HoodieNativeAvroHFileReader`:\r\n<img width=\"1868\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-06-21 at 17 53 07\"

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen we check if the Spark record is a delete record, we add logic to check the `_hoodie_operation`.\r\nIf the field exists, and its value is \"D\", then we think this record is a delete record.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIncorporate more logic to identify delete records.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe changed the format of partition field table config \"hoodie.table.partition.fields\" for custom keygen on master and Hudi 1.0.  Hudi 1.0 reader should be able to read both 1.0 and 0.x tables with custom key generator and different partition field table config formats.\r\nThe PR makes sure that old partition field format in TableConfig is also handled. The new format was used for determining partition schema for timestamp partition type in custom keygen.\r\nThe PR also handles the logic where partition path field config `hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field` is derived from existing table config so that it uses the custom keygen partition type when available.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nMajor changes: As part of HUDI-8076 proposal, \r\n\r\n1. Create Factory Interface for instantiating HoodieInstant and Hoodie Timelines. \r\n2. Use TimelineLayout to determine what version to use for Timeline and instant specific logic.\r\n3. HoodieInstant has following new interfaces: (a) InstantFactory : Construct HoodieInstant (b)InstantFileNameFactory : Construct filenames from HoodieInstant (c) InstantFileNameParser : Encapsulates logic to extract timestamp,.. (d) InstantComparator : Encapsulates logic to compare instants (e:g completion time based) - Each of these interfaces has implementation for 0.15 and 1.x release versions.\r\n4. Make Timeline classes such as HoodieActiveTImeline, HoodieArchiveTImeline and DefaultTImeline as interfaces. \r\n6. Port 0.x timeline and HoodieInstant logic as one implementations of the above factory and timeline interfaces. \r\n7.  Refactor existing timeline classes as 1.x implementation for the new timeline interfaces.\r\n8. Handle 0.x commit and other metadata \r\n9. Create new interface for ArchiveTimelineWriter and migrate 0.x code.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nRefactoring to allow supporting writing and reading in different version compatibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhile building colstats for `bytes` field, we noticed that the comparison throws below exception:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: [B cannot be cast to java.lang.Comparable\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.avro.generic.GenericData.compare(GenericData.java:1263)\r\n\tat org.apache.avro.generic.GenericData.compare(GenericData.java:1148)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nByte arrays are not inherently comparable. So, we first need to wrap in `ByteBuffer`. This PR fixes the issue and adds a simple comparison test.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFix byte array comparison (colstats is one use case).\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Add new write config `hoodie.write.table.version` to specify the table version to be created and produced by the writer.\r\n- Add new write config `hoodie.write.auto.upgrade` to control whether or not writer can auto-upgrade a table when attempting to write to a table with lower version. \r\n- Wiring in the table version in all write paths and validate that write and table versions match, on all write operations and tooling. \r\n-  Only table versions 6,8 are supported as valid value for hoodie.write.table.version\r\n- Handle rollback done in startCommit* methods and as part of upgrade, w.r.t table version mismatches\r\n- Code cleanups on HoodieBaseClient's children around createTable, adhoc creation of HoodieTable, without creating writeClient, handle case-by-case, renaming few methods that are out of convention, cleanup HoodieTableMetaClient static helper methods. Finally, also streamline creation of meta client and table initialization across the tests\r\n \r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdding validating last N file slices with HoodieMetadataValidator. Sometimes validating just latest may not be able to catch out of sync issues. But validating all file slices might be time consuming if lot of file slices are retained. So, adding a new parameter w/ HoodieMetadataTableValidator where in, users can choose to validate last N file slices. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUsers can choose to validate latest N files slices after this patch. \"--validate-last-n-file-slices\" can be used to avail this feature. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Return the meta client created when doing a \"refreshTimeline\" so we can use that instance instead of creating a new one\r\n- Add ability to initialize the table during StreamSync creation without loading the full timeline\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- Makes the construction of the StreamSync class more lightweight\r\n- Minor efficiency gains by avoiding re-reading the hoodie properties when building meta clients\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.
