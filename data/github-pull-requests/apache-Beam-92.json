of `forkEvery 1` is typically a strong sign of poor quality / bad code and should be avoided: \r\n\r\n- It often hides resource leaks, either in code or worse, potentially in the runner itself.\r\n- It significantly impacts performance when running tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces new JUnit rules to better manage the lifecyle of `SparkContext` or `SparkContextOptions` and allows to safely reuse those for all tests of a suite where applicable. The previous `ReuseSparkContextRule` leaks the SparkContext and was removed. Besides, with `forkEvery 1` trying to reuse the `SparkContext` is absolutely pointless ...\r\n\r\nThere's might be more issues hidden I didn't discover locally ... I'll keep a look.\r\n\r\nThis also reduce the runtime of tests to ~30 secs from 1:30+ mins.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Made DataprocClusterManager 1:1 with real clusters instead of 1:1\r\n   with pipelines.\r\n3. Deprecated bidict and many unnecessary mappings in Clusters class.\r\n4. Added a create factory in Clusters class to create cluster managers.\r\n5. Used default cluster metadata to replace the default cluster name.\r\n   Now each cluster created has a distinct cluster name.\r\n6.

the current build setup, developer experience is fairly poor when working with the cross version build for Spark (but also similarly for Flink):\r\n\r\n- Sources for version specific overrides are copied to a new location and defined as Gradle sources at that location. \r\n  1) First of all, this is totally unnecessary. These sources are not shared and should be used in place. \r\n  2) Much more troublesome, the actual sources won't be resolved / checked by any IDE anymore and can't be properly worked on that way. Sadly for no reason at all ...\r\n- The actual shared resources on the other hand are referenced (added to srcDirs) in place. The IDE will randomly assign them to one Spark version module. Typically, for IntelliJ at least, that's the first (lower) one and not the one developers are actively working on.\r\n\r\nThe suggested changes in this PR are:\r\n- Don't copy version specific overrides\r\n- Only copy shared sources conditionally based on a flag. This allows developers to disable copying to pick a primary version they intend to work on.\r\n\r\nNote: This is primary a cosmetic flag to improve IDE integration and has no impact on builds, even if all modules disable copying.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Python code tabs display.\r\n- [Resource hints](http://apache-beam-website-pull-requests.storage.googleapis.com/17379/documentation/runtime/resource-hints/index.html)\r\n  - Set `language-go` in local storage and reload page. Java and Python code tabs display.\r\n  - Go to a different page and select Python, which sets `language-py`. Return to this page. Java and Python code tabs display, and Python tabs are active, as expected.\r\n- [Java Quickstart](http://apache-beam-website-pull-requests.storage.googleapis.com/17379/get-started/quickstart-java/index.html)\r\n  - In local storage, change `shell-unix` to `shell-unicorn`, which is not an available shell tab. Refresh page. Unix and Powershell tabs display as expected, with Unix active.\r\n  - Ensure that switching between Unix and Powershell works as expected.\r\n  - In local storage, set runner to `runner-dataflower`, which is not an available runner. Refresh page. Runner tabs display as expected, with Direct runner active.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

bigtable-client-core to the latest and explicitly declaring a newer version of google-cloud-bigquery (a dependency of bigtable-client-core).\r\n\r\ncom.google.cloud.bigtable:bigtable-client-core is a library\r\nfor an implementation deatil of bigtable access. For Java 7\r\nsupport, the library declares old version of google-cloud-bigtable\r\nlibrary. However the old version does not work with latest GAX\r\nlibrary. Beam users would face AbstractMethodError.\r\nBy explicitly declaring google-cloud-bigtable at this module, we\r\nensure that Beam users get newer version of google-cloud-bigtable\r\nthat is compatible with latest GAX library.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

of Changes**\r\n\r\nThis pr is a continuation of building watermark support in the Go Sdk. It builds on the work done in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/17267 and introduces the ability for watermark estimators to have state that is persisted through splits. It includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Validation (graph/fn.go)\r\n- Code generation (genx/genx.go)\r\n- Execution (exec/sdf.go and exec/sdf_invokers.go)\r\n- Encoding changes (pardo.go)\r\n\r\nThis is built according to the design specified here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DqCYJ-J1YGNelCRIcN5v6BQsZxJB2l5uWBmN4ti--Ew/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n**Next Steps**\r\n\r\nThis work does not attempt any of the following (though it is built in such a way that those should be cleanly supported in subsequent PRs):\r\n\r\n- Manual estimators (passed into ProcessElement)\r\n- Timestamp observing estimators (call ObserveTimestamp on each emitted timestamp)\r\n- Doc changes\r\n- ProcessContinuation support (because ProcessContinuations don't exist in the Go Sdk yet)\r\n\r\n**Manual Testing**\r\n\r\nOn top of all the unit tests introduced, I hacked the existing textio sdf doFn and added the following function:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype DannysEstimator struct {\r\n\tstate time.Time\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (e *DannysEstimator) CurrentWatermark() time.Time {\r\n\treturn e.state\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (fn *readSdfFn) GetInitialWatermarkEstimatorState(_ beam.EventTime, _ offsetrange.Restriction, _ string, _ int64) time.Time {\r\n\t// Return some watermark state\r\n\treturn time.Now()\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (fn *readSdfFn) CreateWatermarkEstimator(initialState time.Time) *DannysEstimator {\r\n\treturn &DannysEstimator{state: initialState}\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (fn *readSdfFn) GetWatermarkEstimatorState(e *DannysEstimator) time.Time {\r\n\tstate := e.state\r\n\treturn state.Add(7 * 24 * time.Hour)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand ran wordCount (with the textio sdf version) on dataflow so that I could observe the output watermark was getting correctly updated to the current wall clock time, and then was getting updated repeatedly on splits. Since I kept adding 7 days to the state every time we split, it eventually got to June:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"459\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42773683/163442776-15a1e681-9c98-4028-b970-94d9e6b9b6f2.png\">\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Avro version to 1.9.2\r\n\r\nThe main changes:\r\n- Avro completely moved to `java.time.*` instead of `org.joda.time.*`. So, we need to adjust date/time conversions from/to Beam schema accordingly since Beam schema still uses `joda.time`. \r\n- It will require users to regenerate generated Java code with `avro-compiler` (if any)\r\n- There are several failing tests (regression) that should be investigated (WIP).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
