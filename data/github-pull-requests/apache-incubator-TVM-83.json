propose to contribute the STM32 port of the TVM. \r\nThe STM32 are mainly bare-metal boards and often use-cases do not suppose using an OS: Linux, embed,RTOS,etc.\r\nThe STM32 development tools (ex, CubeMX) build standalone applications (no OS) that can be flashed to the board and executed.\r\nIn this TVM port, the TVM is used to compile AI networks into a C code compliant with the STM32 AI API.\r\nIn particular, the TVM is used to build a C module (kernels library + JSON graph + params); then the stm32.emitter.py generates the C implementation from the TVM module's JSON graph and writes out a C implementation of the kernels.\r\nThe generated C code can then be included as part of a larger STM32 application, and managed within a standard STM32 application development flow.\r\nThis contribution includes:\r\n - a python/tvm/contrib/stm32 directory with scripts necessary for compiling and communication with the STM32 board\r\n - a src/runtime/stm32 directory that includes runtime support used by the STM32 applications\r\n - an apps/stm32 README and examples running in the STM32 DISCOVERY H747 board.\r\nTested on development board with several models including mnist, inceprion, squeezenet, mobilenet, yolo, and a number of proprietary models.\r\nThis contribution does not modify any of the original TVM files.\r\n@areusch \r\n@tqchen

PR introduces two new rewrites:\r\n- `ConcretizeLike`: replaces `*_like` operators with their concrete-shape equivalent when the result shape is concrete.\r\n- `EliminateIdentity`: eliminates identity expressions like `x + 0`, `1 * x`, etc. Expressions that broadcast `x` to a new shape are not removed, although we could explicitly replace them with broadcasting ops (not sure of the performance difference for this). This pass supports eliminating scalar constant 0s and 1s, but will not eliminate constants with more than a single element.\r\n\r\nI also refactored the existing DFPatternCallback-based passes slightly to lift out common machinery.\r\n\r\nTogether, these rewrites should help optimize the generated AD code (and credit to @t-vi for prototyping them in the blog post).\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen @comaniac @MarisaKirisame @yzhliu \r\n\r\n(I'll work on a `DeadParameterElimination` pass to complement `ConcretizeLike` as we discussed in the previous PR, but will send as a follow-up.)\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-24T06:05:05Z","updated_at":"2021-03-31T20:45:18Z","closed_at":"2021-03-31T20:44:34Z","merged_at":"2021-03-31T20:44:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"b3ab19ed63bca0481557dab095c08e24e49dda78","assignee":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

been hitting a lot of errors running models with ONNX, that has led to a lot of piecewise fixes. This is an attempt to fix the importer more broadly by running the tests onnx ships with pip https://github.com/onnx/onnx/tree/master/onnx/backend/test/data/node\r\n\r\nThese files contain an onnx graph, input arrays, and expected outputs, so we can test directly against the canonical onnx tests. This PR provides a method to import these tests as parameterized unit tests, execute them, and skip any we know currently fail. I also fixed a lot of low hanging fruit to reduce the number of skipped unit tests.\r\n\r\nFuture PRs will work to fix the currently skipped tests, and then extend this to GPU.\r\n\r\nFor reference, this is the pytest result on my system, testing against ONNX 1.6, which is what we have in CI:\r\n\r\n`434 passed, 123 skipped, 83 deselected, 1185 warnings in 32.40s`\r\n\r\nThis adds a lot of tests, but they are all small, so the runtime is actually pretty minuscule, and it improves our ONNX import coverage dramatically.\r\n\r\ncc @jwfromm @masahi @jroesch @electriclilies @adelbertc

are using push constants to pass scalar arguments to SPIR-V kernels. The vulkan spec ensures that the size of push constants storage is at least 128 bytes. Since we pass each scalar via 64 bit union, that means we can only pass 16 parameters via push constants. Unfortunately, for fused, dynamic input kernel, the number of `any_dim` and other params can easily go beyond that limit. See for example this crazy kernel that needs 20 scalars to be passed in https://gist.github.com/masahi/ce51c0d51c6115109203b3732f185aab\r\n\r\nThis PR enables passing parameters beyond push constants limit, using [uniform buffer object](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.1.114.0/windows/tutorial/html/07-init_uniform_buffer.html). In particular, with this PR I was able to run PyTorch MaskRCNN end to end on Vulkan! \r\n\r\nRunning NMS tests in `onnx/test_forward.py` serves as a test case.\r\n\r\nThere are some minor TODOs left, but I'd like to get some feedback. Supporting UBO requires making non trivial changes to both codegen and runtime, but hopefully they are straightforward.\r\n\r\n@tqchen @tmoreau89 @jwfromm @ajtulloch  \r\n\r\nTODO\r\n- [x] Query platform specific push constant size limit rather than using a hard coded constant  \r\n- [x] ~~Fix segfault on deleting UBO host buffer~~ (Seems I shouldn't allocate/deallocate the host buf explicitly, rather use vkMapMemory/vkUnMapMemory)\r\n- [x] Add doc comments in

there are three printers for TIR: \r\n1. ReprPrinter: Text printer for stmt node. (e.g. `print(for_loop)`)\r\n2. TIRTextPrinter: Text printer for function or module. (e.g. `print(prim_func)`)\r\n3. TVMScriptPrinter: Python syntax printer for function or module.\r\n\r\nNote that TIRTextPrinter and TVMScriptPrinter are designed for round-trip printing and parsing, which may contain necessary info for reconstructing the AST (TIRTextPrinter is designed for it but has not supported now). In this PR, I add TIRTextPrinter support for Block and BlockRealize. Then all three printers and one parser (TVMScriptParser) support TensorIR.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n```\r\n#[version = \"0.0.5\"]\r\nprimfn() -> () {\r\n  block([16, tir.reduce_axis(0, 16)], \"block\") as [vx, vy] {\r\n    bind(vx, x)\r\n    bind(vy, y)\r\n    tir.reads([buffer[vx, vy]])\r\n    tir.writes([buffer_2[vx]])\r\n    tir.attrs({\"attr_key\": \"attr_value\"})\r\n    buffer_4 = alloc_buffer(float32[16, 16])\r\n    buffer_5 = match_buffer_region(buffer[0:16, 0:16])\r\n    with init() {\r\n      buffer_2[vx] = 0f32\r\n    }\r\n    buffer_2[vx] = (buffer_2[vx] + buffer[vx,

In case when we build runtime without ARC, we can have problems with\r\n   memory releasing. Due to some of Objective-C methods returns\r\n   autoreleased pointers, we should specify `autoreleasepool` blocks to\r\n   determine life cycle of these pointers.\r\n2. Added fix for problem with work group size.\r\n   Sometimes auto scheduler generates parameters when work group size\r\n   is more than possible. And in this case we got assert from Metal\r\n   library. Added check for this situation and it helps to avoid\r\n   assert.\r\n3. Fixed memory leak problem when fill tensor by random data.\r\n   DLManagedTensor increases reference counter in NDArray but nobody\r\n   delete this DLManagedTensor in proper way. This is why memory which\r\n   was allocated by NDArray was never released.\r\n4. Removed unnecessary retains. It is not necessary to use retain in some\r\n   places where they were used, due to we build metal runtime without\r\n   ARC.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

PR introduces 2d texture memory support to the OpenCL Device API runtime.\r\n\r\n**Device runtime**\r\n- The device runtime supports allocating texture memory both as a temporal workspace and as a runtime data space. In the latter case, special invocation of AllocDataSpace with a memory_scope == \"texture(:weight)\" is required. Special memory scopes were added to the runtime in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7488. \r\n- Workspace allocations are handled via a set of idle texture pools which are grown to match the requested sizes. The strategy employed is to first pick the pool which requires the least amount of extra space beyond, and then to minimize the amount of wasted space that growing a two dimensional pool may incur. A similar approach is taken for the ahead of time graph runtime memory planner for data space allocations (see: #7690).\r\n- CopyFromTo support is expanded to handle the case of directly reading from / writing to image buffers from host. \r\n\r\nSee RFC here:

this PR, I introduce the DataLoader class. The DataLoader is an abstract class intended to wrap datasets from other machine learning frameworks so that they can be used interchangeably within TVM for any data-aware tasks. \r\n\r\nI also provide three implementations of the DataLoader class: TFDataLoader NumpyDataLoader, and RandomDataLoader. \r\n\r\nThe TFDataLoader wraps Tensorflow datasets. \r\nThe NumpyDataLoader wraps numpy arrays of data in NCHW form (where N is the total number of datapoints). Keras datasets provide data in this form-- the Numpy DataLoader is intended for use with Keras datasets, but could also be used with any other dataset stored in a similar fashion. \r\nThe RandomDataLoader takes in a list of shapes and produces random outputs that correspond to those shapes. This class is useful for testing code, especially if you are not at a point where you want to go to the effort of downloading a real dataset.\r\n\r\nThe DataLoader class was originally designed for data-aware quantization. I think it could also be useful for training, and for making accuracy testing scripts more robust and general.\r\n\r\n@mbrookhart @jwfromm @altanh Please take a look and let me know what you

the problem:\r\n`dmlc-core` has cmake generated [build_config.h](https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/blob/main/cmake/build_config.h.in#L13) which enables `DMLC_LOG_STACK_TRACE` in case `cxxabi.h` and `execinfo.h` files are present on the system. This feature (LOG_STACK_TRACE) is used in `dmlc/logging.h` which is used in tvm `runtime/graph/graph_runtime.cc` (via `tvm/runtime/packed_func.h`).\r\n\r\nIn order to build TVM runtime on a systems which do not have `execinfo.h` (e.g. OpenWRT) we should not automatically enable `DMLC_LOG_STACK_TRACE`.\r\nThis check will be done if we use `dmlc-core` as a cmake module.\r\nCurrently TVM build simply points to `dmlc-core` `src` and `include` folders but does not use dmlc-core cmake logic during the build.\r\nInstead of that we should use `dmlc-core` as another cmake project.\r\nFor example xgboost already [using dmlc-core as a cmake project](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L153)\r\n\r\nTo verify that the fix works.\r\n1. Rename `/usr/include/execinfo.h` to smth else\r\n1. build tvm runtime.\r\n```\r\ncmake ..\r\nmake runtime\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe build should work.","created_at":"2021-03-18T22:57:20Z","updated_at":"2021-03-19T00:33:27Z","closed_at":"2021-03-19T00:33:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"96b92c67a2bb2f098d3e6897a360200d4fc77243","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7701/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7701/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7701/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/0958adb9ff56cc8805d520ca9739bc06f4a14b86","head":{"label":"apivovarov:dmcl-core-cmake","ref":"dmcl-core-cmake","sha":"0958adb9ff56cc8805d520ca9739bc06f4a14b86","user":{"login":"apivovarov","id":218087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODA4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov","html_url":"https://github.com/apivovarov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147742342,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDc3NDIzNDI=","name":"tvm","full_name":"apivovarov/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apivovarov","id":218087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODA4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov","html_url":"https://github.com/apivovarov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apivovarov/tvm","description":"Open

was recently some discussion about how the onnx importer should handle being passed a shape dict that contains inputs not found in the onnx graph. Currently, the importer will just ignore these inputs. However, this could lead to user confusion if they make a simple typo and are expecting different behavior than what they get. This PR adds checking for inputs in the shape dict that arent part of the graph and informs the user if it finds any. Overall, this should provide a more clear experience.\r\n\r\nI added a test to confirm the behavior works as described and found that one of our onnx tests (test_pad) was actually providing gratuitous input

#7683.\r\n\r\nThe go bindings are using a **very** brittle approach to vendoring TVM. They build their own version of the tvm_runtime by just `#include`ing all the runtime files. This does not correctly link to dependencies and breaks every time a new runtime file is added. The go bindings should really just link directly to libtvm_runtime.so. Then would could avoid issues like this in the future. @srkreddy1238 could you submit a PR for this?\r\n\r\n@leandron @srkreddy1238

PR utilizes the core StorageToken allocation framework provided by the graph memory planner, but extends it to additionally support optimization of two dimensional allocations. The storage_ids and storage_scopes for each Expr output are then provided to the graph runtime, from which a minimal set of one and two dimensional flat buffer and texture memory storage pools can be allocated, respectively. \r\n\r\n**GraphMemoryPlanner**\r\n- The StorageAllocator Request, Alloc, and CheckRelease, as a few helpers have been refactored into a TokenAllocator, which can dispatch to a one or two dimensional token allocator based on the token storage scope. \r\n- TokenAllocator1D's implementation is identical to what exists prior to this PR\r\n- TokenAllocator2D utilizes a similar bin packing strategy but also tracks the excess space that increasing a storage pool would incur. The strategy is as follows,\r\n  - For a given token allocation request search among the idle texture pools, keeping track of which pool would require the least amount of additional memory. If a requested allocation fits within an existing pool, no additional memory would be required. If not, expand the pool which results in the least amount of added space.\r\n  - For any set of free storage pools which do not require expansion for the given allocation request, choose the pool which would minimize the amount of wasted memory.\r\n  -  Note also that during optimization requests are only queried against candidate pools of the same type as this is a requirement of texture memory alignment.\r\n\r\n**Graph runtime**\r\n- The graph runtime PoolEntry previously tracked a single dimension for allocation (size). This PR replaces that with a std::vector<int64_t> shape. For global scope, this shape is only one dimensional. For texture scope this shape is three dimensional (width, height, channel).\r\n- The graph runtime uses the storage ids and scope information to grow pool entries along one or two axes for storage pools of global or texture scope, respectively. \r\n- For 1D pools nothing has changed, the size of the allocation is determined from the maximum number of bytes required for all entries in a storage pool, and the resulting pool is of kDLFloat type and byte aligned. \r\n- For 2D texture pools the size of an image pool is determined from the maximum number of row and column elements required for all entries of a storage pool, and retains the type of the underlying pool entries.\r\n\r\nSee RFC here:

PR adds a target specific implementation of CollectStorageInfo and CollectBufferBinds for the `opencl --device=adreno` target. \r\n\r\n**CollectStorageInfo**\r\n- Returns a storage mapping for the outputs of each Expr in a Relay function. For Adreno, the output storage is set to \"texture\" for primitive functions containing a Conv2d with data and kernel layouts of NCHW4c and OIHW4o, respectively, are.\r\n- The output storage scope for Constants and Vars is inferred from the output storage scope of their consumers. \r\n- A legalization step occurs that ensures that the output of any primitive function is set to global scope if one or more of its consumers requires global scope for its output. This legalization step occurs after the storage scopes have been collected and therefore is not transitive so that the global scope does not propagate toward the inputs.\r\n- An additional legalization step occurs to ensure that the global outputs of the relay Function are marked as global scope. This can be removed if CopyFromTo will support passing shape information for the source and destination tensors, or if texture memory reuse is disabled\r\n  - The key issue is that the allocated texture space being read from for a output tensor may be a pool, in which case pitch region and row pitch will be required to correctly read the texture from the pool to the host. The region and pitch information can be inferred from the shape of the src and dst tensors if provided to CopyToFrom. \r\n\r\n**CollectBufferBinds**\r\n- Translates the storage scopes information provided by the memory planner (and ultimately the above CollectStorageInfo pass) to tir::Buffers that can be bound to te::Tensors when lowering Relay primitive functions. These buffers are provided to CompileEngine and used in `tvm::lower/build` via the binds field. If the provided buffers have texture scope, the TIR TextureFlattening pass will handle lowering the multidimensional accesses to two dimensions.\r\n\r\nSee RFC here:

PR adds generic support for the use of storage scope in Relay's graph runtime lowering path. The key conceptual additions made are:\r\n- Introduce a target dependent CollectStorageInfo pass which returns a storage mapping for the outputs of each Expr in a Relay function. The consumers of the output storage scope annotations are:\r\n  - The graph runtime memory planner, which can utilize the output storage scope when doing token allocation optimization\r\n  - The graph runtime codegen, which annotates the graph json with these storage scopes.\r\n  - The target dependent CollectBufferBinds packed function which translates these storage scopes into buffers to be bound when lowering a Relay primitive func in CompileEngine (via the binds field of tvm::lower/build)\r\n  - Finally the graph runtime, which utilizes the storage scope annotations in the graph json when setting up data space storage\r\n\r\nThe two introduced CollectStorageInfo and CollectBufferBinds are dispatched to via a target dependent packed function. If no implementation exists for a given target, the storage scope of each Expr defaults to global scope and the runtime is unaffected. \r\n\r\nSee RFC here:

PR introduces the `opencl --device=adreno` target and corresponding relay strategies. The conv2d schedules introduced here utilize spatial and channel-wise packing for the weights (OIHW4o) and activations (NCHW4c), respectively, both with vector length 4 to support lowering to RGBA texture memory. \r\n\r\n**AutoTVM support**\r\n- AutoTVM doesn't currently capture the runtime context of extracted tasks. Without capturing information about the runtime buffer scopes, the codegeneration during tuning will only occur on flat buffers (not texture). For now, we utilize a cache_read(\"texture\") stage when tuning to explore the performance benefit of utilizing texture memory. We believe that with a sufficient number of iteration's per trial, the copy time to texture prior to running the main compute kernel (which results from a cache_read) should be constant over the search and therefore not greatly impact the tuning results. \r\n\r\n- Note that the cache_read is not needed when using the graph_runtime which supports passing in external texture buffers (see: #7688). Therefore, in the schedules one will observe `if autotvm.GLOBAL_SCOPE.in_tuning:` which around scheduling related to adding a cache_read to texture stage. \r\n\r\n- The schedules can be simplified once either 1) AutoTVM tuning supports capturing this runtime information during task extraction (thereby removing the need for a cache_read to texture) or  2) once texture lowering in tir.TextureFlatten fully supports cache_read cancellation (external buffer forwarding through the cache_read). Cancellation currently is supported except for the cases of padding wherein an extra texture to texture copy results.\r\n\r\nSee RFC here:

PR introduces 2d texture memory support for TE, TIR, OpenCL codegen, and the OpenCL Device API. \r\n\r\nThe lowering process is driven principally by the TextureFlatten TIR lowering pass which flattens multi-dimensional loads and stores to two dimensional accesses. The texture lowering is agnostic to the utilization of the texture memory, e.g. via `cache_read(\"texture\")` as a temporary scratch pad, or from a runtime tir::Buffer Var of TextureType.\r\n\r\n**Layout**\r\n- The current lowering path assumes two dimensional textures will always have the lowest dimension of size 4 (RGBA); in this way, the use of packed layouts for activations and weights are required. In [Part 2] schedules are introduced using NCHW4c and OIHW4o to take advantage of the texture lowering path. \r\n- Separate Nd to 2d lowering conventions are employed for activation and for weights. For activations all dimensions save the last (excluding the vector length 4 dimension) are packed into columns of the texture image; for weights all dimensions save the first are packed into rows of the texture image: \r\n```\r\nscope == \"texture\" :: [A, B, C, D, 4] -> [A*B*C, D, 4]\r\nscope == \"texture:weight\" :: [A, B, C, D] -> [A, B*C*D, 4]\r\n```\r\nAdditionally, if any other layout lowering is desired, one can apply logical shape changes via a te.compute in the topi compute definition to ensure the flattening occurs as desired.\r\n\r\n- These two lowering conventions are used in TIR lowering, the opencl device runtime, and in the graph runtime, and are implemented in \"src/runtime/texture.h\". \r\n\r\n**Codegen**\r\n- OpenCL codegen of `write_image` and `read_image` on image2d_t's of type CL_FLOAT and CL_HALF types and RGBA channel order are supported. \r\n- A pass is added in code generation to infer `__read_only` and `__write_only` access qualifiers for the utilized texture buffers, resulting in kernel signatures like, \r\n\r\n```\r\n__kernel void fused_nn_kernel0(__read_only image2d_t placeholder0,  ..., __write_only image2d_t compute,) \r\n```\r\n\r\n- To avoid extra texture reads, SSA intermediates are utilized when an explicit cache_read to local memory is not specified. \r\n- Single element index into an RGBA texture read is supported to enable outer product style broadcasting.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee RFC here:

there is negligible code sharing between the first-order and higher-order AD in Relay, I've factored out the first-order AD pass to a separate file. Additionally, I've made it a proper IRModule pass, and fixed a few spots where adding tuples wasn't being lifted correctly. I tried my best to add some diagnostics.\r\n\r\nTo complement AD, I've also added a pass called `ConcretizeLike` that transforms the `*_like` operators generated during AD to the explicit-shape equivalent (e.g. `zeros_like(x, y) -> zeros(x, y.shape)`), which removes some forward dependencies and could enable more opportunity for operator fusion. Note that this is the same thing as `LikeZapp` from @t-vi's [blogpost](https://lernapparat.de/transformers-pytorch-tvm/) with perhaps a bit more error checking.\r\n\r\ncc @t-vi @MarisaKirisame @tqchen

fixes TIR scan + dynamic input shape on VK / SPIRV. I debugged this problem by doing scan on 2 elements, so that up/downsweep run only one iteration.\r\n\r\nI found that when `scan_axis_size` is dynamic whose runtime value is 2, the value of `lim` is 0 instead of expected 1. Surprisingly this issue was fixed by casting `scan_axis_size` to float32 instead of 64. I realized that generally GPUs (especially low ends) don't have great support for fp64, so I think this is better.\r\n\r\nNow dynamic cumsum, argwhere etc are working with VK.\r\n\r\n@mbrookhart

the type checker returns an `IncompleteTypeNode` for a match expression that has no clauses. This means the incomplete type node can be unified with another type and be valid even though a match expression with no clauses has no defined semantics and shouldn't be permitted. I think it would be sensible for the type checker to disallow match expressions with no clauses.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the match completeness checker would normally prevent an empty match expression, but they can still pass the type checker if the `complete` flag is set to off. Hence a function like this would type check even though it makes no sense: `def @main() ->  fn () ->   fn (  ()) ->   bool {   match? 1 {}}`\r\n\r\nThis PR checks for empty match expressions and produces a type checking error. Bug discovered by fuzzing thanks to @Flandini\r\n\r\nPlease review @jroesch @MarisaKirisame \r\n\r\n(Aside: Maybe we should define semantics for missing an incomplete match -- I believe we had an idea for a fatal error expression before, so maybe that could be a better fix.)","created_at":"2021-03-12T04:39:06Z","updated_at":"2021-03-14T00:04:43Z","closed_at":"2021-03-14T00:04:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3e361f991f77b702c473a7524ea9bf49db7f88b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7647/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7647/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7647/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/8903477d29dd4cc25675f4c083d00c8bf742c529","head":{"label":"slyubomirsky:tyck-empty-match","ref":"tyck-empty-match","sha":"8903477d29dd4cc25675f4c083d00c8bf742c529","user":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":149190623,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDkxOTA2MjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"slyubomirsky/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky/tvm","description":"Open
