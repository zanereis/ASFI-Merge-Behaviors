Description\r\n\r\nIf the volumes are in QCOW2 format, the shrinking will be handled on\r\nthe agents' side. There are cases in some storage plugins where the\r\nvolumes' format is kept in the DB in QCOW2, but the actual format is raw.\r\nTill the current implementation, this was limiting the plugins to shrink\r\nthe volumes. Now this will be handled by the storage plugins.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature

Description/Report\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a Clone VM feature at the API level (as part of GSoC project #4818), which enables the creation of a fully-cloned virtual machine with ROOT / DATA disks, and the same system configuration as the original VM. (Currently Supported for KVM hypervisor only)\r\n\r\nSteps involved: \r\n1. Creation of temporary snapshots (during the clone VM operation) for both ROOT\r\n2. Creation of template from the ROOT disk snapshot\r\n3. Create a new VM from the template created in step 2\r\n4. Automatic assignment of new network resources for the new Cloned VM\r\n5. Creation of temporary snapshots for data disk\r\n6. Create data disk Volume from the snapshots created in step 5\r\n7. Newly created DATA disk created in step 6 is attached to the new VM\r\n8. Cleanup of temporary resources (snapshots) and error handling of the clone VM process\r\n\r\nNote: The template created in step 2 cannot be cleaned up as the newly created clone VM uses this template\r\n\r\nFeature included: \r\n- A new CloneVmCmd API interface to use this feature\r\n- A clone button in the compute instance page supporting the related functionalities\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- Documentation PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/236\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n![Clone Scene](https://github.com/atrocitytheme/atrocitytheme.github.io/blob/7428f0e73c980669a46202da124daca3bf958975/cloudstack.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\nThis has been manually tested with a mbx KVM setup on a local machine and mbx kvm setup on GCP\r\n\r\n- This feature has been tested on a local Linux system with KVM support (5.3.0-64-generic Ubuntu) and Google Cloud instance (4.9.0-15-amd64 Debian)\r\n- Try with cloudmonkey if the management server is running with default configurations.\r\n```\r\ncloneVirtualMachine virtualmachineid=<target_vm_id>\r\n```\r\nwill start the cloning process, it'll create a new cloned VM and start it (with all copied data available), network Ip will be assigned to DB instantly and the actual VM will get this IP after a while\r\n- When secondary system VM agents are not available, the cloning process will fail and clean the previously cloned resources\r\n- It'll copy all the data disk content from the target VM no matter whether the data disks are mounted in the VM system or the VM is running\r\n- Temporary resources created (snapshots) during the process will not remain whether the clone succeeds or not\r\n- New smoke test has been added in test_vm_life_cycle.py with class TestCloneVM, which tests the clone of a VM with data disk attached.\r\n- New unit test has been added as validateCloneCondition in the UserVmManagerImpl class\r\n- Manual test of Clone: in the VM page, there's a clone VM button, click it and it'll clone a new VM if with the correct hypervisor setup. \r\n### GCP environment setup\r\n- Create a GCP instance with nested virtualization enabled, for detailed requirements see: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-virtualization/overview\r\n- After creating the instance, deploy a KVM host using mbx: https://github.com/shapeblue/mbx (centos7)\r\n- Before deploying and configuring the cloudstack agent, enable the system nested kvm by: \r\n```\r\ncat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested\r\n// if return N\r\nsudo modprobe -r kvm_intel\r\nsudo modprobe kvm_intel nested=1 \r\n```\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document

machine. \r\n\r\nDifferent manual test scenarios:\r\n1. When the persistent network is created and the host is added afterwards, the newly added host has the persistent network's resources.\r\n2. When a host within a zone with a persistent network is removed from the zone, its resources will be cleaned up.\r\n3. When a host with a running VM is removed from the zone, the running VM will migrate before the resources are cleaned up.\r\n4. When a host is rebooted, it still has access to the persistent network's resources.\r\n\r\nA Marvin component test under \r\ntest/integration/component/test_persistent_networks.py\r\nadded that tests the following steps for a KVM environment.\r\n1. identify hosts in the zone, and remove the first\r\n2. create a L2 persistent network\r\n3. add the host back to the zone\r\n\r\nValidation steps:\r\n1. Persistent network state should be implemented before adding the host\r\n2. Host should be added back in successfully\r\n3. Host should have the persistent networks resources after being added\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\nTest output results should be:\r\n\r\n==== Marvin Init Started ====\r\n\r\n=== Marvin Parse Config Successful ===\r\n\r\n=== Marvin Setting TestData Successful===\r\n\r\n==== Log Folder Path: /tmp/MarvinLogs/<LogId>.

Description\r\n\r\nIn the past, the broadcast uri was changed to an \"i\" for isolated, as well as c for community. \r\n\r\nsee https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/4040\r\n\r\nHowever, the ingest logic has not been adjusted, which means it's no longer possible to ingest a VM with a community \r\nnetwork.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I've adapted the condition and add correct pvlan type. \r\n\r\n### **Important**\r\n**All existing community network broadcast uri's in cloudstack before 4.15.1.0 must be updated manually or new created \r\nbecause all community networks contains the letter i in the broadcast uri.**\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND

newer libvirt/qemu it seems PCI hot-plugging could be an issue as\r\nseen in:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000019383\r\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1836065\r\n\r\nThis was found to be true on ARM64/aarch64 platform (tested on\r\nRaspberryPi4). As per the default machine doc, it advises to\r\npre-allocate PCI controllers on the machine and pcie-to-pci-bridge based\r\ncontroller for legacy PCI models:\r\nhttps://libvirt.org/pci-hotplug.html#x86_64-q35\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces the concept as a workaround until a proper fix is\r\ndone (ideally in the upstream libvirt/qemu projects). Until then client\r\ncode can add 32 PCI controllers and a pcie-to-pci-bridge controller for\r\naarch64 platforms.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the ability to run the cloudstack-setup-databases script without having to know the root user credentials.\r\n\r\nThe cloud and cloud_usage databases and cloud user can be manually configured by a different admin prior to running the script.\r\n\r\nIt will allow the script to be called like this:\r\n./cloudstack-setup-databases user:password@host:port -s \r\nor\r\n./cloudstack-setup-databases user:password@host:port --schema-only \r\n\r\nUsing this flag will instruct to skip the SQL files responsible for creating the databases, user and granting permissions to the user. It will still run all other SQL scripts that need to be run before starting the management server for the first time. Initial databases and user creation will be the responsibility of the administrator.\r\n\r\nDoc PR here: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/229  \r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your

cloud and cloud_usage databases and cloud user prior to executing the script, and then executing the script like this:\r\n\r\n./cloudstack-setup-databases user:password@host:port -s \r\nor\r\n./cloudstack-setup-databases user:password@host:port --schema-only \r\n\r\nAn extra option is listed from:\r\n./cloudstack-setup-databases -h\r\n```\r\n  -s, --schema-only     Creates the db schema without having to pass root\r\n                        credentials - Please note: The databases (cloud,\r\n                        cloud_usage) and user (cloud) has to be configured\r\n

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR provides support for adding resource icons/ images for Zones, templates, ISOs, UserVMs, Networks, VPCs, Domains, Projects, Accounts and users which will helps users/admins in future to identify special-purpose templates and VMs using custom icons in UI. Some of the attributes of this feature includes:\r\n- Users will inherit the account's icon if not present. \r\n- Isolated networks tiers of a VPC network will inherit the Icon of the VPC network if present.\r\n- Resources that support uploading custom icons have a small symbol    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10495417/124738693-d03fc400-df36-11eb-9971-d06fb0c154ee.png) against the logo.\r\n- Users with permission to access resources can upload/update and delete the icons. If no icons have been provided, it follows the normal behavior. Info Card view will also display the corresponding resource's icons if present.\r\n- The Deploy VM wizard will show the list of zones in the form of cards in the number of zones are <=

zone name \r\n\r\n- The capacity dashboard view will also display the zone icons beside the zone names as shown above\r\n- The project list view (Used for switching to different projects available, on the Dashboard page) will also list the project icons beside the project

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR gives you the option to choose between podman and docker in the docker.sh script.\r\nI came up with this idea because Red Hat and the most Red Hat-Distribution does not allow docker anymore. Instead they use podman. \r\nNow you can choose between both options while entering a -p for podman or a -d for docker after the ./docker.sh command.\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how

Description\r\n\r\n- Some servers (such as [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/prepare-tls-1.2-in-office-365?view=o365-worldwide) exchange) are deprecating TLSv1 and TLSv1.1. On alert's and project's mailing settings, ACS uses the protocol TLSv1; therefore, operators do not have options to choose which version they want to use.\r\n\r\n- ACS has configurations (`\\*.smtp.useAuth`) to inform if it will use secure SMTP authentication when sending emails; However, this configuration only refers to the use of SSL. Operators have no means to choose if they want to use StartTLS option.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to externalize the protocol's and StartTLS settings on alert's and project's mail sending. Alert and project (also quota) send email through the class `SMTPMailSender`, inserted in PR [4954](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/4954), which will handle these configurations.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a test lab.\r\n\r\nI set SMTP global settings to project and alert and enabled StartTLS (global setting); Then I allowed `Less secure app access` on my Google account and set the following settings:\r\n```\r\nserver address: smtp.gmail.com\r\nusername: <gmail address>\r\npassword: <gmail password>\r\nport (TLS): 587\r\n```\r\n- To alert, I started mgmt;\r\n- To project, I enabled global setting `project.invite.required` and added a user via email;\r\n\r\nIn Gmail, we have an option to `show original` message, which provides the TLS version and the cipher. So I changed the configuration a few times and sent some alerts and invitations to verify if both versions, in configuration and Gmail, were the same.","created_at":"2021-06-16T13:43:16Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T04:07:24Z","closed_at":"2021-07-21T12:01:12Z","merged_at":"2021-07-21T12:01:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"eb3acc334b082f95fb930424a01c0538507bbeb6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843366,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:enhancement","name":"type:enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1391968610,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzkxOTY4NjEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Severity:Minor","name":"Severity:Minor","color":"906666","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/16","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/16","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/16/labels","id":5714156,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTcxNDE1Ng==","number":16,"title":"4.16.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":460,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-30T05:24:55Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T06:54:13Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2021-11-10T02:02:01Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5119/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5119/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/5119/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/9e2d763bbaac3191b21f59877391265e39739c51","head":{"label":"GutoVeronezi:externalize-tls-version-and-security-protocols-configuration-on-mail-sending","ref":"externalize-tls-version-and-security-protocols-configuration-on-mail-sending","sha":"9e2d763bbaac3191b21f59877391265e39739c51","user":{"login":"GutoVeronezi","id":38945620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTQ1NjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38945620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi","html_url":"https://github.com/GutoVeronezi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":325596270,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjU1OTYyNzA=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"GutoVeronezi/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GutoVeronezi","id":38945620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTQ1NjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38945620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi","html_url":"https://github.com/GutoVeronezi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronez

Description\r\n\r\nOver the past years, I have seen some confusion regarding which command to use when changing a VM's offering. Users tend to choose always the API command [changeServiceForVirtualMachine](https://cloudstack.apache.org/api/apidocs-4.15/apis/changeServiceForVirtualMachine.html) and are not aware of [scaleVirtualMachine](https://cloudstack.apache.org/api/apidocs-4.15/apis/scaleVirtualMachine.html). On the best case, the user knows that both commands exist but is not sure about which one to choose.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes some enhancements on the documentation of API commands `changeServiceForVirtualMachine` and `scaleVirtualMachine`. One of the major differences of both is that `scaleVirtualMachine` takes into account disk offerings, and also resizes the volume if necessary while `changeServiceForVirtualMachine` focuses only on updating the \"compute\" offering. \r\n\r\nThis leads to issues and inconsistencies where a client expects the root volume to have its disk offering updated matching the new Service offering; however, it is not changed and it gets to a point where VM has an offering and the volume another.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if one uses changeServiceForVM to change from a \"Previous Offering\" to \"New Offering\" this is what it happens:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(localcloud) 🐱 > list virtualmachines id=<VM-ID>  filter=name,serviceofferingname,\r\n{\r\n  \"count\": 1,\r\n  \"virtualmachine\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"VM-1234\",\r\n      \"serviceofferingname\": \"New Offering\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n(localcloud) 🐱 > list volumes virtualmachineid=<VM-ID> filter=serviceofferingname, listall=true \r\n{\r\n  \"count\": 1,\r\n  \"volume\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"serviceofferingname\": \"Previous Offering\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposed changes on API descriptions:\r\n#### 1. changeServiceForVirtualMachine\r\nFrom:\r\n~~~\r\nChanges the service offering for a virtual machine.\r\nThe virtual machine must be in a \"Stopped\" state for this command to take effect.\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nTo:\r\n~~~\r\nChanges the service offering for a virtual machine.\r\nThe virtual machine must be in a \"Stopped\" state for this command to take effect.\r\nNote that it only changes the VM's compute offering and it does not update the root volume offering.\r\nIf the Service Offering has a root disk size the volume will be resized only if using API command 'scaleVirtualMachine'.\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 2. Scale Virtual Machine documentation\r\nFrom:\r\n~~~\r\nScales the virtual machine to a new service offering.\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nTo:\r\n~~~\r\nScales the virtual machine to a new service offering.\r\nThis command also takes into account the Volume and it may resize the root disk size according to the service offering.\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that

Description\r\nThis PR fixes the problem of not updating the chain info or setting chain info to null after volume migrations.\r\n\r\nProblem: While fetching the volume chain info, management server assumes datastore name to be a UUID (this is true only for NFS storages added by CloudStack) but datastore name can be with any name.\r\nSolution: To fetch the volume chain info, use datastore name instead of UUID.\r\n\r\nThe fix is made in the flow of following API operations\r\n1. migrateVirtualMachine\r\n2. migrateVirtualMachineWithVolume\r\n3. migrateVolume \r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your

feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt has been tested locally in a test lab. Also, I added unit tests to execute the code sanity of the affected methods.\r\n\r\n1. I created a new Compute Service Offering, with tags and host tag.\r\n2.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen listing service offerings it is expected to list their Root disk size in GB (see documentation [[1]](http://cloudstack.apache.org/api/apidocs-4.15/apis/listServiceOfferings.html)); however, it is returned in Bytes.\r\nAdditionally, during deployment of a VM or creation of a Service Offering the root disk size is always passed as a value in GB [[2]](https://cloudstack.apache.org/api/apidocs-4.15/apis/deployVirtualMachine.html).\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix this by converting the root disk size at the ServiceOffering response from Bytes to GB.\r\n\r\n[1] http://cloudstack.apache.org/api/apidocs-4.15/apis/listServiceOfferings.html\r\n[2]
