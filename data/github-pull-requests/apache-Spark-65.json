One valid scenario where this can break is where the physical type is `timestamp_ntz`, and the logical type is `array<timestamp_ntz>`, since the logical type check does not happen, this conversion is allowed. However, the vectorized reader does not support this and will produce NPE on on-heap memory mode and SEGFAULT on off-heap memory mode. Segmentation fault on off-heap memory mode can be prevented by having an explicit boundary check on OffHeapColumnVector, but this is outside of the scope of this PR, and will be done here: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43452.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPrevent NPE or Segfault from happening.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add three new parameters to the `assertSchemaEqual`: `ignoreNullable`, `ignoreColumnOrder` and `ignoreColumnName` to provide users with more flexibility in schema testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo enhance the utility of `assertSchemaEqual` by accommodating various common schema comparison scenarios that users might encounter, without necessitating manual adjustments or workarounds.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. `assertDataFrameEqual` now have the option to use the five new parameters:\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n\r\nParameter | Type | Comment\r\n-- | -- | --\r\nignoreNullable | Boolean [optional] | Specifies whether a column’s nullable property is included when checking for schema equality.</br></br> When set to True (default), the nullable property of the columns being compared is not taken into account and the columns will be considered equal even if they have different nullable settings.</br></br>When set to False, columns are considered equal only if they have the same nullable setting.\r\nignoreColumnOrder | Boolean [optional] | Specifies whether to compare columns in the order they appear in the DataFrames or by column name.</br></br> When set to False (default), columns are compared in the order they appear in the DataFrames.</br></br> When set to True, a column in the expected DataFrame is compared to the column with the same name in the actual DataFrame. </br></br>ignoreColumnOrder cannot be set to True if ignoreColumnNames is also set to True.\r\nignoreColumnName | Boolean [optional] | Specifies whether to fail the initial schema equality check if the column names in the two DataFrames are different.</br></br> When set to False (default), column names are checked and the function fails if they are different.</br></br> When set to True, the function will succeed even if column names are different. Column data types are compared for columns in the order they appear in the DataFrames.</br></br> ignoreColumnNames cannot be set to True if ignoreColumnOrder is also set to True.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded usage examples into doctest for each parameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBefore https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39170, Spark only supports insert runtime filter for application side of shuffle join on single-layer. Considered it's not worth to insert more runtime filter if the column already exists runtime filter, Spark restricts it at https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/7057952f6bc2c5cf97dd408effd1b18bee1cb8f4/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/optimizer/InjectRuntimeFilter.scala#L346\r\nFor example\r\n`select * from bf1 join bf2 on bf1.c1 = bf2.c2 and bf1.c1 = bf2.b2 where bf2.a2 = 62`\r\nThis SQL have two join conditions. There will insert two runtime filter on `bf1.c1` if haven't the restriction mentioned above.\r\nAt that time, it was reasonable.\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39170, Spark supports insert runtime filter for one side of any shuffle join on multi-layer. But the restrictions on multi-layer runtime filter mentioned above looks outdated.\r\nFor example\r\n`select * from bf1 join bf2 join bf3 on bf1.c1 = bf2.c2 and bf3.c3 = bf1.c1 where bf2.a2 = 5`\r\nAssume bf2 as the build side and insert a runtime filter for bf1. We can't insert the same runtime filter for bf3 due to there are already a runtime filter on `bf1.c1`.\r\nThe behavior is different from the origin and is unexpected.\r\n\r\nThe change of the PR doesn't affect the restriction mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRelease restrictions on multi-layer runtime filter.\r\nExpand optimization surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nNew feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest cases updated.\r\n\r\nMicro benchmark for q9 in TPC-H.\r\n**TPC-H 100**\r\nQuery

This parameter, will return the rows from both DataFrames that are not equal when set to `True`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis enhancement provides users with an easier debugging experience by directly pointing out the rows that do not match, eliminating the need for manual comparison in case of large DataFrames.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. An optional parameter `includeDiffRows` has been introduced in the `assertDataFrameEqual` function. When set to `True`, it will return unequal rows for further analysis. For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndf1 = spark.createDataFrame(\r\n    data=[(\"1\", 1000.00), (\"2\", 3000.00), (\"3\", 2000.00)], schema=[\"id\", \"amount\"])\r\ndf2 = spark.createDataFrame(\r\n    data=[(\"1\", 1001.00), (\"2\", 3000.00), (\"3\", 2003.00)], schema=[\"id\", \"amount\"])\r\n\r\ntry:\r\n    assertDataFrameEqual(df1, df2, includeDiffRows=True)\r\nexcept PySparkAssertionError as e:\r\n    spark.createDataFrame(e.data).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code will produce the following DataFrame:\r\n```\r\n+-----------+-----------+\r\n|         _1|         _2|\r\n+-----------+-----------+\r\n|{1, 1000.0}|{1, 1001.0}|\r\n|{3, 2000.0}|{3, 2003.0}|\r\n+-----------+-----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded usage example into doctest.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling

If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn this PR we include the SQLSTATE as part of the error message when\r\nspark.sql.error.messageFormat = PRETTY (default)\r\n\r\n```\r\n[DIVIDE_BY_ZERO] Division by zero. Use `try_divide` to tolerate divisor being 0 and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error. SQLSTATE: 22012\r\n== SQL(line 1, position 8) ==\r\nSELECT 1/0\r\n       ^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\nAside from minor changes (like colon vs equal etc) there more options on where to place the information.\r\n\r\n- Between error class and message\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe state is added right before the message text, using a set of brackets (e.g. round):\r\n[DIVIDE_BY_ZERO](22013) Division by zero. Use `try_divide` to tolerate divisor being 0 and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error.\r\n== SQL(line 1, position 8) ==\r\nSELECT 1/0\r\n       ^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n- At the very end after the context\r\n\r\n```\r\n[DIVIDE_BY_ZERO] Division by zero. Use `try_divide` to tolerate divisor being 0 and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error.\r\n== SQL(line 1, position 8) ==\r\nSELECT 1/0\r\n       ^^^\r\nSQLSTATE: 22013\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth of these alternatives have issues:\r\n\r\n- The SQLSTATE itself is not interesting to a human. It is 5 alphanumerics that are hard to remember and have less information than the human-readable error class. As such it contributes nothing to anyone who wants to read the message.\r\n- The \"context\" which is currently optionally tailing the message can be length and complex. We may also decide to refine it in the futire. So adding SQLSTATE after it makes it hard to find. What, for example, if we want to nest error messages and the \"stack-trace\" should show multiple error messages. In that case SQLSTATE would be like a closing bracket, and hard to match.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo provide useful information for users to e.g. catch exceptions based on SQLSTATE or look up information.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, error messages change\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a new rule **RepartitionBeforeWriting** to add a shuffle before writing data into partitioned table or bucket table when\r\n**AUTO_REPARTITION_FOR_WRITING_ENABLED** is true, which can avoid creating too many small files.\r\n\r\n* For bucket tables, repartition by bucket columns.\r\n* For partition tables, repartition by dynamic partition columns.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nNow, when writing data into partitioned table, there will be at least dynamicPartitions * ShuffleNum files; when writing data into bucket table, there will be at least bucketNums * shuffleNum files.\r\nWe can shuffle by the dynamic partitions or bucket columns before writing data into the table and will create ShuffleNum files.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar rule in kyuubi:

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFix a build issue, when building a runnable distribution from master code running spark-sql raise error:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.sparkproject.guava.util.concurrent.internal.InternalFutureFailureAccess\r\n\tat java.base/jdk.internal.loader.BuiltinClassLoader.loadClass(BuiltinClassLoader.java:641)\r\n\tat java.base/jdk.internal.loader.ClassLoaders$AppClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoaders.java:188)\r\n\tat java.base/java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:520)\r\n\t... 58 more\r\n```\r\nthe problem is due to a gauva dependency in  spark-connect-common POM that **conflicts**  with the shade plugin of the parent pom.\r\n\r\n- the spark-connect-common contains `connect.guava.version` version of guava, and it is relocation as `${spark.shade.packageName}.guava` not the `${spark.shade.packageName}.connect.guava`;\r\n- The spark-network-common also contains guava related classes, it has also been relocation is `${spark.shade.packageName}.guava`, but guava version `${guava.version}`;\r\n- As a result, in the presence of different versions of the classpath org.sparkproject.guava.xx;\r\n\r\nIn addition, after investigation, it seems that module spark-connect-common is not related to guava, so we can remove guava dependency from spark-connect-common.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBuilding a runnable distribution from master code is not runnable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

The problem seems to be that when AQEShuffleRead does a coalesced read it can return a HashPartitioning with the coalesced number of partitions. This causes a correctness bug as the partitioning is not compatible for joins with other HashPartitioning even though the number of partitions matches. This is resolved in this patch by introducing CoalescedHashPartitioning and making AQEShuffleRead return that instead.\r\n\r\nThe fix was suggested by @cloud-fan \r\n\r\n> AQEShuffleRead should probably return a different partitioning, e.g. CoalescedHashPartitioning. It still satisfies ClusterDistribution, so Aggregate is fine and there will be no shuffle. For joins, two CoalescedHashPartitionings are compatible if they have the same original partition number and coalesce boundaries, and CoalescedHashPartitioning is not compatible with HashPartitioning.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add six new parameters to the `assertDataFrameEqual`: `ignoreNullable`, `ignoreColumnOrder`, `ignoreColumnName`, `ignoreColumnType`, `maxErrors`, and `showOnlyDiff` to provide users with more flexibility in DataFrame testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo enhance the utility of `assertDataFrameEqual` by accommodating various common DataFrame comparison scenarios that users might encounter, without necessitating manual adjustments or workarounds.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. `assertDataFrameEqual` now have the option to use the six new parameters:\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n\r\nParameter | Type | Comment\r\n-- | -- | --\r\nignoreNullable | Boolean [optional] | Specifies whether a column’s nullable property is included when checking for schema equality.</br></br> When set to True (default), the nullable property of the columns being compared is not taken into account and the columns will be considered equal even if they have different nullable settings.</br></br>When set to False, columns are considered equal only if they have the same nullable setting.\r\nignoreColumnOrder | Boolean [optional] | Specifies whether to compare columns in the order they appear in the DataFrames or by column name.</br></br> When set to False (default), columns are compared in the order they appear in the DataFrames.</br></br> When set to True, a column in the expected DataFrame is compared to the column with the same name in the actual DataFrame. </br></br>ignoreColumnOrder cannot be set to True if ignoreColumnNames is also set to True.\r\nignoreColumnName | Boolean [optional] | Specifies whether to fail the initial schema equality check if the column names in the two DataFrames are different.</br></br> When set to False (default), column names are checked and the function fails if they are different.</br></br> When set to True, the function will succeed even if column names are different. Column data types are compared for columns in the order they appear in the DataFrames.</br></br> ignoreColumnNames cannot be set to True if ignoreColumnOrder is also set to True.\r\nignoreColumnType | Boolean [optional] | Specifies whether to ignore the data type of the columns when comparing.</br></br> When set to False (default), column data types are checked and the function fails if they are different.</br></br> When set to True, the schema equality check will succeed even if column data types are different and the function will attempt to compare rows.\r\nmaxErrors | Integer [optional] | The maximum number of row comparison failures to encounter before returning.</br></br> When this number of row comparisons have failed, the function returns independent of how many rows have been compared.</br></br> Set to None by default which means compare all rows independent of number of failures.\r\nshowOnlyDiff | Boolean [optional] | If set to True, the error message will only include rows that are different.</br></br> If set to False (default), the error message will include all rows (when there is at least one row that is different).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded usage examples into doctest for each parameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce a baseline implementation of state processor - reader.\r\n\r\nState processor is a new data source which enables reading and writing the state in the existing checkpoint with the batch query. Since we implement the feature as data source, we are leveraging the UX for DataFrame API which most users are already familiar with.\r\n\r\nFunctionalities of the baseline implementation are following:\r\n\r\n* Specify a state store instance via store name (default: DEFAULT)\r\n* Specify a stateful operator via operator ID (default: 0)\r\n* Specify a batch ID (default: last committed)\r\n* Specify the source option joinSide to construct input rows in the state store for stream-stream join\r\n  * It is still possible that users can read a specific state store instance from 4 instances in stream-stream join, which would be used mostly for debugging Spark itself\r\n  * When this is enabled, the data source hides the internal column from the output.\r\n* Specify a metadata column (_partition_id)so that users can indicate the partition ID for the state row.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the SPIP doc for rationale: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_iVf_CIu2RZd3yWWF6KoRNlBiz5NbSIK0yThqG0EvPY/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, we are adding a new data source.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test suite.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-10-18T06:06:58Z","updated_at":"2023-11-15T01:45:24Z","closed_at":"2023-11-15T01:45:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f16a99423e017bdc9babb4f8f9c33a0724fabc15","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCouple of minor improvements to `StreamingForeachBatchHelper`:\r\n\r\n  * Make `RunnerCleaner` private and add ScalaDoc.\r\n  * Update contract for `pythonForeachBatchWrapper()` to inform that call should eventually should `close()` the `AutoClosable` returned. \r\n  \r\nIn addition, it also fixes a flake in Protobuf unit test.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n  - Code readability improvement.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n - Existing tests.\r\n - For protobuf suite, verified with seed set to '399'. It fails before this PR and passes after.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-18T05:54:09Z","updated_at":"2023-10-19T05:15:53Z","closed_at":"2023-10-19T05:15:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd242a0830969dd26d2a0a4d1369816b93b79e3d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4654282764,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABFWq4DA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PROTOBUF","name":"PROTOBUF","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43424/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43424/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43424/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/085dee3d85e61a201b4bd0a9624f5e3ecb212341","head":{"label":"rangadi:feb-scaladoc","ref":"feb-scaladoc","sha":"085dee3d85e61a201b4bd0a9624f5e3ecb212341","user":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":235638810,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzU2Mzg4MTA=","name":"spark","full_name":"rangadi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* Included rule ID pruning when traversing the expression trees in `TypeCoercionRule` (this avoids us from traversing the expression tree over and over again in future iterations of the rule)\r\n* Improved `EquivalentExpressions`:\r\n  * Since `supportedExpression()` is checking for the existence of a pattern in the tree, changed to check the `TreePatternBits` instead of recursing using `.exists()`\r\n  * When creating an `ExpressionEquals` object, calculating the height requires recursing through all of its children, which is O(n^2) when called upon each expression in the expression tree. This changes it so that this height is cached in the `TreeNode`, so that it is now O(n) when called upon each expression in the tree\r\n* More targeted TreePatternBits pruning in `ResolveTimeZone` and `ConstantPropagation`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR improves some analyzer and optimizer rules to address inefficiencies when handling extremely large expression trees.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere should be no plan changes, so no unit tests were modified.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nEnsure that store instance is not used after calling commit within output mode streaming aggregation\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout these changes, we were accessing the store instance to retrieve the iterator even after the commit was called. When commit is called, we release the DB instance lock. So its possible task retries can acquire the instance lock and close the DB instance. So when the original thread tries to access the DB, it might run into a null pointer exception. This change fixes the issue\r\n\r\n```\r\n        org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.StreamingQueryException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 5.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure:

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe propose to make SQLSTATEs mandatory field when using error classes in the new error framework.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBeing able to rely on the existence of SQLSTATEs allows easier classification of errors as well as usage of tooling to intercept SQLSTATEs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAs documented in the JIRA ticket, FallbackStorage.copy sometimes will throw FileNotFoundException even though we check for file that exists. This will cause the BlockManagerDecommissioner to be stuck in endless loops and prevent executors from exiting. \r\nWe should ignore any FileNotFoundException in this case, and set keepRunning to false for all other exceptions for retries. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix a bug documented in the JIRA ticket\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTests weren't added due to difficulty to replicate the race condition. \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to support utility functions `assert_frame_equal`, `assert_series_equal`, and `assert_index_equal` in the Pandas API on Spark to aid users in testing.\r\n\r\nSee [pd.assert_frame_equal](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.testing.assert_frame_equal.html), [pd.assert_series_equal](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.testing.assert_series_equal.html), [pd.assert_index_equal](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.testing.assert_index_equal.html) for more detail.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThese utility functions allow users to efficiently test the equality of `DataFrames`, `Series`, and `Indexes` in the Pandas API on Spark. Ensuring accurate testing helps in maintaining code quality and user trust in the platform.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.pandas.testing import assert_frame_equal\r\n\r\ndf1 = spark.createDataFrame([('Alice', 1), ('Bob', 2)], [\"name\", \"age\"])\r\ndf2 = spark.createDataFrame([('Alice', 1), ('Bob', 2)], [\"name\", \"age\"])\r\n\r\nassert_frame_equal(df1, df2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Users will now have access to `assert_frame_equal`, `assert_series_equal`, `and assert_index_equal` functions for testing purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded doctests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAll children of If should be eliminate common  expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere are three children in If: predicate, trueValue and falseValue.\r\n\r\nThere are two execution paths. 1: predicate and trueValue. 2: predicate and falseValue.\r\n\r\nThere are three conbinations of possible common subexpression. 1: predicate and trueValue. 2: predicate and falseValue. 3: trueValue and falseValue.\r\n\r\nSo if all possible common subexpression be eliminated, there is 2 3 possibility to improve the performance. For example, if there is common subexpression in predicate and falseValue, and common subexpression is executed only once, and it can improve the performance. Only there is common subexpression in trueValue and falseValue will not improve the performance and it will not draw back the performance, since whether trueValue and falseValue will be executed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting testcase\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUser can specify `rowTag` option that is the name of the XML element that maps to a `DataFrame Row`.  A non-existent `rowTag` will not infer any schema or generate any `DataFrame` rows.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change ensures that RPC SSL options settings inheritance works properly after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43238 - we pass `sslOptions` wherever we call `fromSparkConf`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that minor mechanical change, duplicate/add tests for every place that calls this method, to add a test case that runs with SSL support in the config.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed to ensure that the RPC SSL functionality can work properly with settings inheritance. In addition, through these tests we can ensure that any changes to these modules are also tested with SSL support and avoid regressions in the future.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nFull integration testing also done as part of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42685\r\n\r\nAdded some tests and ran

`KafkaSourceStressSuite` stable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe test case `KafkaSourceStressSuite` has become very unstable after the merger of SPARK-45502, with 10 out of the recent 22 tests failing because of it. Revert it for now, and we can upgrade Kafka again after resolving the test issues.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/6497999347/job/17648385705\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr adds an environment variable `PACKAGE_BEFORE_DEPLOY` to the `publish-snapshot` process. When `PACKAGE_BEFORE_DEPLOY` is true, the publish process will be split into two steps: the first step is to package with mvn package, and the second step is to deploy the packaged jar.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this PR sets `PACKAGE_BEFORE_DEPLOY` to true in the `publish_snapshot.yml` configuration.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake the `publish-snapshot` task in GitHub Action to be divided into two steps, which can alleviate the resource pressure brought by direct deploy.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nOn the lines of DPP which helps DataSourceV2 relations when the joining key is a partition column, the same concept can be extended over to the case where joining key is not a partition column.\r\nIn this PR, the keys available in the BroadcastHashJoinExec are pushed down to the DataSourceV2 scans in form of a SortedSet structure.\r\nFor non partition columns, the DataSources like iceberg have max/min stats on columns available at manifest level, and for formats like parquet , they have max/min stats at various data structure levels. The passed SortedSet can be used to prune using ranges at both driver level ( manifests files) as well as executor level ( while actually going through chunks , row groups etc at parquet level)\r\n\r\nIf the data is stored as Columnar Batch format , then it would not be possible to filter out individual row at DataSource level, even though we have keys.\r\nBut at the scan level, ( ColumnToRowExec) it is still possible to filter out as many rows as possible , if the query involves nested joins. Thus reducing the number of rows to join at the higher join levels.\r\n\r\nAttaching link to a presentation which outlines the idea:\r\n[Broadcast Keys pushdown](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/165Rx7i00TmAKnDJpSQLfrcrW-ShrzPy5/edit?usp=drive_link)\r\n\r\nSPIP : [SPIP-44662](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44662)\r\n\r\nWhy are the changes needed?\r\nThere is scope of improvement in the performance of Inner and Left Semi join queries when using BroadcastHashJoin\r\n\r\nDoes this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\nHow was this patch tested?\r\nRan TPCDS suite using iceberg as DataSource.\r\nConverted many of the existing Spark Query tests to also run using iceberg as data source.\r\nWill be adding more unit tests.","created_at":"2023-10-14T03:15:36Z","updated_at":"2024-02-21T00:49:51Z","closed_at":"2024-02-21T00:48:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b28ff87b3bf632b6f732da7e02948105a897bacc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43373/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43373/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43373/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0d9b1ff64dc70d323c6cc9028da6626b586410e6","head":{"label":"ahshahid:master-broadcast-var","ref":"master-broadcast-var","sha":"0d9b1ff64dc70d323c6cc9028da6626b586410e6","user":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105594707,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU1OTQ3MDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"ahshahid/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd assert and log to indicate watermark definition is required for streaming aggregation queries in append mode\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe have a check for ensuring that watermark attributes are specified in append mode based on the UnsupportedOperationChecker. However, in some cases we got report where user hit this stack trace:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Exception thrown in awaitResult: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 3 in stage 32.0 failed 4 times, most recent failure: Lost task 3.3 in stage 32.0 (TID 606) (10.5.71.29 executor 0): java.util.NoSuchElementException: None.get\r\n        at scala.None$.get(Option.scala:529)\r\n        at scala.None$.get(Option.scala:527)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.StateStoreSaveExec.$anonfun$doExecute$9(statefulOperators.scala:472)\r\n        at scala.runtime.java8.JFunction0$mcV$sp.apply(JFunction0$mcV$sp.java:23)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.util.Utils$.timeTakenMs(Utils.scala:708)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.StateStoreWriter.timeTakenMs(statefulOperators.scala:145)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.StateStoreWriter.timeTakenMs$(statefulOperators.scala:145)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.StateStoreSaveExec.timeTakenMs(statefulOperators.scala:414)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.StateStoreSaveExec.$anonfun$doExecute$5(statefulOperators.scala:470)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.state.package$StateStoreOps.$anonfun$mapPartitionsWithStateStore$1(package.scala:63)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.state.StateStoreRDD.compute(StateStoreRDD.scala:127)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.computeOrReadCheckpoint(RDD.scala:406)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, the reason for failure is not immediately clear. Hence adding an assert and log message to indicate why the query failed on the executor.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter the task set fails to find schedulable tasks, before checking if there are tasks that cannot be scheduled on any executor, filter out the executors corresponding to the profileId of that task set.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn scenarios involving multiple resource profiles (e.g., prof1 and prof2), when a taskset (prof1) has only one remaining task (task0) awaiting scheduling, and there are executors (executor0 with prof0 and executor1 with prof1), if executor1 fails to run task0, executor1 gets blacklisted for task0. Consequently, task0 becomes unschedulable, leading to a blockage in the task scheduling process.\r\n\r\n**Example Code:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nval rprof = new ResourceProfileBuilder()\r\nval ereqs = new ExecutorResourceRequests()\r\nereqs.memory(\"4g\")\r\nereqs.memoryOverhead(\"2g\").offHeapMemory(\"1g\")\r\nval resourceProfile = rprof.require(ereqs).build()\r\nval rdd = sc.parallelize(1 to 10, 1).withResources(resourceProfile)\r\nrdd.map(num => {\r\n  if (TaskContext.get().attemptNumber() == 0) {\r\n    throw new RuntimeException(\"First attempt encounters an error\")\r\n  } else {\r\n    num / 2\r\n  }\r\n}).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reason:**\r\nThe issue arises when the taskSet becomes unschedulable. The logic attempts to find a task that cannot be scheduled on any executor across all profiles. However, when determining whether an executor can schedule the task, there is no distinction made based on the resource profile. This leads to an incorrect assumption that executor0 (prof0) can schedule the task, which is not the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd Uts\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-13T08:28:35Z","updated_at":"2024-01-27T00:17:21Z","closed_at":"2024-01-27T00:17:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b77968f1fa59f80dd04a1347521c4f4f7ef69e46","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43366/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43366/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43366/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cafc0a6600a9bbd17af1e9d924a5c58c4b0700ac","head":{"label":"lyy-pineapple:git-profile","ref":"git-profile","sha":"cafc0a6600a9bbd17af1e9d924a5c58c4b0700ac","user":{"login":"lyy-pineapple","id":46274164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjc0MTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46274164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple","html_url":"https://github.com/lyy-pineapple","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506059736,"node_id":"R_kgDOHinb2A","name":"spark","full_name":"lyy-pineapple/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lyy-pineapple","id":46274164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjc0MTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46274164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple","html_url":"https://github.com/lyy-pineapple","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lyy-pineapple/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImprove the infamous `KafkaSourceStressSuite`, I find there are more than one reason for this problem, the most frequently failure path is: [XXX, Add partition, CheckAnswer], I guess we are not granted to get offsets from empty partitions when fetching data in `MicroBatchExecution`.\r\n\r\n I run the test locally  more than 10 times and they are all successful after made this change, I even increased iterations from 50 to 100 and it only failed once in more than 10 times.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make test less flaky, at least 90% more reliable the before. however, it's still possible to fail since I find some other reason\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nGithub CI\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a new Python data source API and adds initial execution support for data source read. \r\n\r\nHere is an overview of the Python data source API. Please see the code (`python/pyspark/sql/datasource.py`) for more details.\r\n```python\r\nclass DataSource(ABC):\r\n    def __init__(self, options: Dict):\r\n        self.options = options\r\n\r\n    @property\r\n    def name(self) -> str:\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n    def schema(self) -> Union[StructType, str]:\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n    def reader(self, schema: StructType) -> \"DataSourceReader\":\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n    # TODO: SPARK-45525\r\n    def writer(self, schema: StructType, saveMode: str) -> \"DataSourceWriter\": \r\n        ...\r\n```\r\nDataSourceReader (this PR):\r\n```python\r\nclass DataSourceReader(ABC):\r\n    @abstractmethod\r\n    def read(self, partition) -> Iterator:\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n    def partitions(self) -> Iterator[Any]:\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote this PR does not support reading a Python data source using `spark.read.format(...).load()`. This will be supported in a subsequent PR: [SPARK-45639](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-45639).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  5. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make Spark more accessible to Python users. For more information, please see this [SPIP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYrCKEKHzznljYfJO4kx5K_Npcgt1Slyfph3NEk7JRU/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Users can use the new Python data source API to create their own data source.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter many improvements, `InjectRuntimeFilter` is a bit complex. We need add more comments to give more design details and rename some variable name so that the `InjectRuntimeFilter` have better readability and maintainability.\r\n\r\nThe core of a runtime filter is join keys, but the suffix `Exp` is not intuitive, so it's better to use the suffix `Key` directly. So rename as follows:\r\n`filterApplicationSideExp` -> `filterApplicationSideKey`\r\n`filterCreationSideExp` -> `filterCreationSideKey`\r\n`findBloomFilterWithExp` -> `findBloomFilterWithKey`\r\n`expr` -> `joinKey`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove the readability and maintainability.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n'No'.\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-13T02:59:38Z","updated_at":"2023-10-16T08:01:57Z","closed_at":"2023-10-16T07:40:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9e7926ed7998bc355f709570d7fc79bee166d743","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43359/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43359/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43359/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ed7d33e45bce53646ffe7c0f1476896f76238bb7","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-45531","ref":"SPARK-45531","sha":"ed7d33e45bce53646ffe7c0f1476896f76238bb7","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates Python UDTF evaluation to return a useful error message if UDTF returns None for any non-nullable column.\r\n\r\nThis implementation also checks recursively for None values in subfields of array/struct/map columns as well.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import AnalyzeResult\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import ArrayType, IntegerType, StringType, StructType\r\n\r\nclass Tvf:\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def analyze(*args):\r\n        return AnalyzeResult(\r\n            schema=StructType()\r\n                .add(\"result\", ArrayType(IntegerType(), containsNull=False), True)\r\n            )\r\n\r\n    def eval(self, *args):\r\n        yield [1, 2, 3, 4],\r\n\r\n    def terminate(self):\r\n        yield [1, 2, None, 3],\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM Tvf(TABLE(VALUES (0), (1)))\r\n\r\n> org.apache.spark.api.python.PythonException\r\n[UDTF_EXEC_ERROR] User defined table function encountered an error in the 'eval' or \r\n'terminate' method: Column 0 within a returned row had a value of None, either directly or\r\nwithin array/struct/map subfields, but the corresponding column type was declared as non\r\nnullable; please update the UDTF to return a non-None value at this location or otherwise\r\ndeclare the column type as nullable.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPreviously this case returned a null pointer exception.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up of #43042.\r\n\r\nFix to resolve UnresolvedPolymorphicPythonUDTF when the table argument is specified as a named argument.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe Python UDTF analysis result was not applied when the table argument is specified as a named argument.\r\n\r\nFor example, for the following UDTF:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n@udtf\r\nclass TestUDTF:\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self._count = 0\r\n        self._sum = 0\r\n        self._last = None\r\n\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def analyze(*args, **kwargs):\r\n        return AnalyzeResult(\r\n            schema=StructType()\r\n            .add(\"count\", IntegerType())\r\n            .add(\"total\", IntegerType())\r\n            .add(\"last\", IntegerType()),\r\n            with_single_partition=True,\r\n            order_by=[OrderingColumn(\"input\"), OrderingColumn(\"partition_col\")],\r\n        )\r\n\r\n    def eval(self, row: Row):\r\n        # Make sure that the rows arrive in the expected order.\r\n        if self._last is not None and self._last > row[\"input\"]:\r\n            raise Exception(\r\n                f\"self._last was {self._last} but the row value was {row['input']}\"\r\n            )\r\n        self._count += 1\r\n        self._last = row[\"input\"]\r\n        self._sum += row[\"input\"]\r\n\r\n    def terminate(self):\r\n        yield self._count, self._sum, self._last\r\n\r\nspark.udtf.register(\"test_udtf\", TestUDTF)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following query shows a wrong result:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"\"\"\r\n...     WITH t AS (\r\n...       SELECT id AS partition_col, 1 AS input FROM range(1, 21)\r\n...       UNION ALL\r\n...       SELECT id AS partition_col, 2 AS input FROM range(1, 21)\r\n...     )\r\n...     SELECT count, total, last\r\n...     FROM test_udtf(row => TABLE(t))\r\n...     ORDER BY 1, 2\r\n... \"\"\").show()\r\n+-----+-----+----+\r\n|count|total|last|\r\n+-----+-----+----+\r\n|    1|    1|   1|\r\n|    1|    1|   1|\r\n|    1|    1|   1|\r\n|    1|    1|   1|\r\n|    1|    1|   1|\r\n|    1|    1|   1|\r\n|    1|    1|   1|\r\n|    1|    1|   1|\r\n|    1|    1|   1|\r\n|    1|    1|   1|\r\n|    1|    1|   1|\r\n|    1|    1|   1|\r\n|    1|    2|   2|\r\n|    1|    2|   2|\r\n|    1|    2|   2|\r\n|    1|    2|   2|\r\n|    1|    2|   2|\r\n|    1|    2|   2|\r\n|    1|    2|   2|\r\n|    1|    2|   2|\r\n+-----+-----+----+\r\nonly showing top 20 rows\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThat should equal to the result without named argument:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"\"\"\r\n...

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR extends existing SparkConnect `SparkSession.addArtifact` API to support Apache Ivy URIs in extend to the existing local `.jar` & `.class` file support. It leverages the existing support of Apache Ivy which was previously a part of spark-code (`SparkSubmitUtils`)\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the following changes:\r\n1. Refactoring `SparkSubmitUtils` and moving Ivy-related parts to `commons` module. This results in adding two small dependencies to `common` (`apache ivy` and `commons-io`)\r\n2. Extracting some parts of `Utils` & `TestUtils` to `common`\r\n3. Extending SparkConnect `SparkSession.addArtifact` to support Ivy URIs\r\n\r\nRefactoring changes done in 1-2 are not altering code functionality. These changes are mostly about moving code between files & packages and adjusting some dependencies\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt's possible to add maven artifacts to Spark, but SparkConnect currently lacks this functionality\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes: it extends the existing SparkConnect `SparkSession.addArtifact` API to support more URI types\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests covering Ivy resolution functionality;\r\nNew test in `ArtifactSuite` testing ivy support in `ArtifactManager`\r\nNew E2E test in `ReplE2ESuite` testing adding maven library and using it from UDF\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI
