to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-17T09:35:42Z","updated_at":"2023-08-21T08:41:47Z","closed_at":"2023-08-21T08:41:47Z","merged_at":"2023-08-21T08:41:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"4c75227681a53a87d8fc12133e79f0492bfb6027","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12923/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12923/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12923/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3150ce57f7f0aa4cfaa480731c8a8110bc94274e","head":{"label":"xiezheng-XD:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"3150ce57f7f0aa4cfaa480731c8a8110bc94274e","user":{"login":"xiezheng-XD","id":141627292,"node_id":"U_kgDOCHEPnA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/141627292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD","html_url":"https://github.com/xiezheng-XD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":679636421,"node_id":"R_kgDOKIJtxQ","name":"dubbo","full_name":"xiezheng-XD/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiezheng-XD","id":141627292,"node_id":"U_kgDOCHEPnA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/141627292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD","html_url":"https://github.com/xiezheng-XD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiezheng-XD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiezheng-XD/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-17T02:42:55Z","updated_at":"2023-08-17T06:21:37Z","closed_at":"2023-08-17T06:21:37Z","merged_at":"2023-08-17T06:21:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"dd70c5a142f029d297c3ed0148cdd51a205f747a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12922/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12922/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12922/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/93e6dec9947318834cc9f8f12673b00a04847838","head":{"label":"yanfangli85:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"93e6dec9947318834cc9f8f12673b00a04847838","user":{"login":"yanfangli85","id":63247242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQ3MjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63247242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85","html_url":"https://github.com/yanfangli85","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":679207171,"node_id":"R_kgDOKHvhAw","name":"dubbo3.2","full_name":"yanfangli85/dubbo3.2","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yanfangli85","id":63247242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQ3MjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63247242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85","html_url":"https://github.com/yanfangli85","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yanfangli85/dubbo3.2","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

did not add the hashCode method. But after thinking about it, I found that the httpMethod did not add the hashCode method, which only made the hashMap more prone to element collisions, not the reason for obtaining the wrong RestMethodMetadata.\r\n\r\nIt can be seen from the following figure that the wrong InvokerAndRestMethodMetadataPair is obtained from the pathToServiceMapNoPathVariable\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/assets/91795546/27d2412c-8ccc-464d-b7cf-328e9d011ac4)\r\n\r\nFinally, I found that the httpMethodMatch method needs to determine whether the httpMethods are equal as long as one of the two PathMatchers needCompareHttpMethods is true. But its judgment is wrong.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/assets/91795546/1305a698-78d7-4107-86c2-bf7044e541e3)\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it).

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-16T11:33:21Z","updated_at":"2023-08-16T12:22:57Z","closed_at":"2023-08-16T12:04:26Z","merged_at":"2023-08-16T12:04:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"b87746b19fb99b60b3e6973b3b50e3daca04eb27","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12917/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12917/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12917/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/29f1b05b35d53de827d5525b33eba9d3ed4ae623","head":{"label":"songxiaosheng:cathc_metric_bus","ref":"cathc_metric_bus","sha":"29f1b05b35d53de827d5525b33eba9d3ed4ae623","user":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":534049587,"node_id":"R_kgDOH9TzMw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"songxiaosheng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-16T02:54:33Z","updated_at":"2023-08-16T06:30:53Z","closed_at":"2023-08-16T06:30:52Z","merged_at":"2023-08-16T06:30:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"972a0814b978682930c11b917f5a2cf85d96e416","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12911/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12911/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12911/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d8cb6b1a976f63c1c56d083148d8defc54bbd61c","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0815-order","ref":"0815-order","sha":"d8cb6b1a976f63c1c56d083148d8defc54bbd61c","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-16T02:27:59Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T03:53:16Z","closed_at":"2023-08-29T03:53:15Z","merged_at":"2023-08-29T03:53:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"f91246ab09afd8e7d89b090d78522e6eeaa2f20d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12910/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12910/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12910/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1015ae545c0ae3a35d6b5b99faf566cab934280b","head":{"label":"huajiao-hjyp:3.3.develop","ref":"3.3.develop","sha":"1015ae545c0ae3a35d6b5b99faf566cab934280b","user":{"login":"huajiao-hjyp","id":53164956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTY0OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53164956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajiao-hjyp","html_url":"https://github.com/huajiao-hjyp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajiao-hjyp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajiao-hjyp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajiao-hjyp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajiao-hjyp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajiao-hjyp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajiao-hjyp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajiao-hjyp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajiao-hjyp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajiao-hjyp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.3","ref":"3.3","sha":"679ce4496cb441b062bad0f555ccd9bd288f22e6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-15T12:29:45Z","updated_at":"2023-08-16T11:29:57Z","closed_at":"2023-08-16T11:29:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5bfe1245451a0c86a507bc8ebf30ef5a60280ac9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12906/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12906/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12906/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8dc6feacaa6f3dcd6bbde027d5ea85d7d5b699d9","head":{"label":"songxiaosheng:catch_event","ref":"catch_event","sha":"8dc6feacaa6f3dcd6bbde027d5ea85d7d5b699d9","user":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":534049587,"node_id":"R_kgDOH9TzMw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"songxiaosheng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nfix #12904 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-15T09:55:54Z","updated_at":"2023-08-24T11:11:05Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"EarthChen","id":20179425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20179425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen","html_url":"https://github.com/EarthChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12905/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12905/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12905/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/56d613576fb5c3044783dd8aa6478fb615afd89e","head":{"label":"xlq20080808:ft-non-ASCII-support","ref":"ft-non-ASCII-support","sha":"56d613576fb5c3044783dd8aa6478fb615afd89e","user":{"login":"xlq20080808","id":33999699,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTk5Njk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33999699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808","html_url":"https://github.com/xlq20080808","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":678263261,"node_id":"R_kgDOKG153Q","name":"dubbo","full_name":"xlq20080808/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xlq20080808","id":33999699,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTk5Njk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33999699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808","html_url":"https://github.com/xlq20080808","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlq20080808/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xlq20080808/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-15T09:17:13Z","updated_at":"2023-08-16T02:53:43Z","closed_at":"2023-08-16T02:53:43Z","merged_at":"2023-08-16T02:53:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"4dbd31ebb1b0d589b0d55eeadb1062889de9e311","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12903/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12903/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12903/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c424e9912c87d6f4c00ae5d4e1d52c29f0b441f9","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0815-log","ref":"0815-log","sha":"c424e9912c87d6f4c00ae5d4e1d52c29f0b441f9","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-13T02:22:25Z","updated_at":"2023-08-17T09:55:12Z","closed_at":"2023-08-17T09:01:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"48e67c433ff3564440baf37b91efce2f400c32e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12889/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12889/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12889/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/56bf94c31d31c63fce9f27bfc392ad9d313a8eb6","head":{"label":"JunJieLiu51520:feature/dubbo_3.2_fix_rest_service_deployer_serializable_error","ref":"feature/dubbo_3.2_fix_rest_service_deployer_serializable_error","sha":"56bf94c31d31c63fce9f27bfc392ad9d313a8eb6","user":{"login":"JunJieLiu51520","id":42363259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzYzMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42363259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520","html_url":"https://github.com/JunJieLiu51520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"6b617a1ce99552545ebe087fd993f24a224f0c8b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","ty

before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-11T01:29:32Z","updated_at":"2023-08-14T03:50:16Z","closed_at":"2023-08-14T03:50:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d84f63e52482642baf3db368b8f4acc1f47ca1b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12879/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12879/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12879/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f03bb996a1acfff99a76a0fa9e890424afb04919","head":{"label":"lgfei:fix_issue_12798","ref":"fix_issue_12798","sha":"f03bb996a1acfff99a76a0fa9e890424afb04919","user":{"login":"lgfei","id":11389933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzg5OTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11389933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei","html_url":"https://github.com/lgfei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":671828409,"node_id":"R_kgDOKAtJuQ","name":"dubbo","full_name":"lgfei/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lgfei","id":11389933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzg5OTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11389933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei","html_url":"https://github.com/lgfei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lgfei/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-09T13:09:04Z","updated_at":"2023-08-11T02:41:39Z","closed_at":"2023-08-11T02:41:39Z","merged_at":"2023-08-11T02:41:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"8fe122b08a620bb08c15af0d3df25c8772152f51","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12872/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12872/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12872/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8fdd578cacba4fd514ce218d9c95a8aa89aa49cc","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.2-MetadataIdentifier-add-toString","ref":"3.2-MetadataIdentifier-add-toString","sha":"8fdd578cacba4fd514ce218d9c95a8aa89aa49cc","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-09T03:10:57Z","updated_at":"2023-08-09T09:11:17Z","closed_at":"2023-08-09T09:11:16Z","merged_at":"2023-08-09T09:11:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"1dd248affa1c38a10c8fa920a50e8c6d740fab63","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12869/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12869/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12869/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/43fe49ed47b76fcc2d6a98de2f9a4adc92fd2705","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0809-shutdown","ref":"0809-shutdown","sha":"43fe49ed47b76fcc2d6a98de2f9a4adc92fd2705","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-08T14:30:15Z","updated_at":"2023-08-10T14:55:42Z","closed_at":"2023-08-10T14:55:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"38852b617409307fa14ded6129d18384b3d21f37","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12868/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12868/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12868/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2c2018cfbed0926ff9a3a67ae9152561290ef85e","head":{"label":"songxiaosheng:hdr_histogram","ref":"hdr_histogram","sha":"2c2018cfbed0926ff9a3a67ae9152561290ef85e","user":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":534049587,"node_id":"R_kgDOH9TzMw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"songxiaosheng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng/dubbo","description":"Apache

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-07T11:39:26Z","updated_at":"2023-08-16T13:01:29Z","closed_at":"2023-08-16T13:01:28Z","merged_at":"2023-08-16T13:01:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"7290ae59bc69577b5b902dc0f6e161eb4c74db6b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12861/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12861/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12861/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5c39436174304b1d546d6910fc5834556ef050c6","head":{"label":"xixingya:bugfix/12779","ref":"bugfix/12779","sha":"5c39436174304b1d546d6910fc5834556ef050c6","user":{"login":"xixingya","id":37765666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzY1NjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37765666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya","html_url":"https://github.com/xixingya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":652581941,"node_id":"R_kgDOJuWcNQ","name":"dubbo","full_name":"xixingya/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xixingya","id":37765666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzY1NjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37765666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya","html_url":"https://github.com/xixingya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xixingya/dubbo","description":"Apache

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-03T03:44:07Z","updated_at":"2023-08-03T05:05:10Z","closed_at":"2023-08-03T05:05:10Z","merged_at":"2023-08-03T05:05:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"1e18b359e22b25a27a871c5e004281da9cd1484e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12835/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12835/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12835/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/fa7b96b4e71e32cfc740ea96eee49f5741cf805a","head":{"label":"JunJieLiu51520:feature/dubbo3.2_add_rest_method_annotation_support_judge","ref":"feature/dubbo3.2_add_rest_method_annotation_support_judge","sha":"fa7b96b4e71e32cfc740ea96eee49f5741cf805a","user":{"login":"JunJieLiu51520","id":42363259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzYzMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42363259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520","html_url":"https://github.com/JunJieLiu51520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"521b3e01460a70cc8c823e4e8c07f3cff56bc0c7","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-01T04:00:07Z","updated_at":"2023-08-09T06:41:45Z","closed_at":"2023-08-09T06:41:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"663a594868435cda68da1ffbe18ddf55d64744cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12826/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12826/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12826/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ca4fe58fef62157e1faadd1eb8297a18f8cbf2b0","head":{"label":"lgfei:0801_fix_dubboprotocol","ref":"0801_fix_dubboprotocol","sha":"ca4fe58fef62157e1faadd1eb8297a18f8cbf2b0","user":{"login":"lgfei","id":11389933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzg5OTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11389933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei","html_url":"https://github.com/lgfei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":671828409,"node_id":"R_kgDOKAtJuQ","name":"dubbo","full_name":"lgfei/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lgfei","id":11389933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzg5OTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11389933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei","html_url":"https://github.com/lgfei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgfei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lgfei/dubbo","description":"Apache

Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-31T07:57:43Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T07:43:21Z","closed_at":"2023-08-01T07:43:20Z","merged_at":"2023-08-01T07:43:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"6c5a876f313e9a7bf2d95d683210f4cb75023877","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12823/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12823/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12823/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/01e297829306da710282f51df190e8b207d91a43","head":{"label":"JunJieLiu51520:feature/dubbo3.3_add_reserence_providedby_by_springcloud_feignclient","ref":"feature/dubbo3.3_add_reserence_providedby_by_springcloud_feignclient","sha":"01e297829306da710282f51df190e8b207d91a43","user":{"login":"JunJieLiu51520","id":42363259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzYzMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42363259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520","html_url":"https://github.com/JunJieLiu51520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.3","ref":"3.3","sha":"ce653172073fc45b04f5deacbf2f31e71bfa8701","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Use fully qualified java.lang.String in all cases in generated code. This fixes compilation if a protobuf message is named “String”.</li>\n<li>Stabilize two io.grpc.Status methods (asRuntimeException &amp; trailersFromThrowable)</li>\n<li>Stabilize io.grpc.ManagedChannelBuilder.useTransportSecurity (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10244\">#10244</a>)</li>\n<li>Stabilize io.grpc.util.MutableHandlerRegistry (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10348\">#10348</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Behavior Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>xds: Handle loops and duplicates in xds Aggregate clusters</li>\n<li>core: Change delay for hedging retry after a non-fatal error to be 0 to match the gRFC (<a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A6-client-retries.md\">A6</a>).</li>\n<li>api: CheckedForwardingClientCall now passes trailers from the caught exception</li>\n<li>xds: require EDS service name in CDS resources with an xdstp name</li>\n<li>xds: Use Rule order instead of RuleChain</li>\n<li>Wrap other name resolver types in a RetryingNameResolver .  Previously, if authority was not overridden, then some name resolvers (such as grpclb) had no retry.</li>\n<li>xds: Environment variable &quot;GRPC_XDS_EXPERIMENTAL_SECURITY_SUPPORT&quot; is no longer respected, so xDS security cannot be disabled any more (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10243\">#10243</a>)</li>\n<li>context, api: Package io.grpc is now consolidated into a single artifact grpc-api by moving classes from grpc-context to grpc-api. grpc-context now has a dependency on grpc-api (but excludes other dependencies of grpc-api) so any application previously using only grpc-context will now also bring in grpc-api. This fixes <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/3522\">#3522</a> which was the major issue preventing support of Java modules. We are not done fixing support, as some artifacts need to be split and Automatic-Module-Name needs to be added. The next release is likely to be more stable for modules.</li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>binder: Add <code>UserHandle</code> and <code>BinderChannelCredentials</code> to support cross-user communication (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10197\">#10197</a>)</li>\n<li>xds,orca: LRS named metrics support</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>core: Resolve isAndroid only once on class loading. This can improve channel creation performance on Android.</li>\n<li>xds: Pick a subchannel with new static stride scheduler in WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>xds: Fix the server sending a GOAWAY when an LDS update with no changes other than ordering is received.</li>\n<li>netty: Fix NPE when a header with errors is received with endStream=true.  This was causing logs to be filled with errors when health checkers didn’t specify a content type.</li>\n<li>okhttp: Fix the Socket data race when shutdown/closed during connecting that was causing a significant delay</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dependencies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgraded Netty to 4.1.93-Final</li>\n<li>Update guava dependency to 32.0.1 to address CVE-2023-2976</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Benjamin Peterson</li>\n<li>Masakuni Oishi</li>\n<li>Philip K.

This fixes compilation if a protobuf message is named “String”.</li>\n<li>Stabilize two io.grpc.Status methods (asRuntimeException &amp; trailersFromThrowable)</li>\n<li>Stabilize io.grpc.ManagedChannelBuilder.useTransportSecurity (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10244\">#10244</a>)</li>\n<li>Stabilize io.grpc.util.MutableHandlerRegistry (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10348\">#10348</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Behavior Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>xds: Handle loops and duplicates in xds Aggregate clusters</li>\n<li>core: Change delay for hedging retry after a non-fatal error to be 0 to match the gRFC (<a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A6-client-retries.md\">A6</a>).</li>\n<li>api: CheckedForwardingClientCall now passes trailers from the caught exception</li>\n<li>xds: require EDS service name in CDS resources with an xdstp name</li>\n<li>xds: Use Rule order instead of RuleChain</li>\n<li>Wrap other name resolver types in a RetryingNameResolver .  Previously, if authority was not overridden, then some name resolvers (such as grpclb) had no retry.</li>\n<li>xds: Environment variable &quot;GRPC_XDS_EXPERIMENTAL_SECURITY_SUPPORT&quot; is no longer respected, so xDS security cannot be disabled any more (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10243\">#10243</a>)</li>\n<li>context, api: Package io.grpc is now consolidated into a single artifact grpc-api by moving classes from grpc-context to grpc-api. grpc-context now has a dependency on grpc-api (but excludes other dependencies of grpc-api) so any application previously using only grpc-context will now also bring in grpc-api. This fixes <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/3522\">#3522</a> which was the major issue preventing support of Java modules. We are not done fixing support, as some artifacts need to be split and Automatic-Module-Name needs to be added. The next release is likely to be more stable for modules.</li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>binder: Add <code>UserHandle</code> and <code>BinderChannelCredentials</code> to support cross-user communication (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10197\">#10197</a>)</li>\n<li>xds,orca: LRS named metrics support</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>core: Resolve isAndroid only once on class loading. This can improve channel creation performance on Android.</li>\n<li>xds: Pick a subchannel with new static stride scheduler in WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>xds: Fix the server sending a GOAWAY when an LDS update with no changes other than ordering is received.</li>\n<li>netty: Fix NPE when a header with errors is received with endStream=true.

Use <code>client.resource(item).isReady()</code> or <code>Readiness.getInstance().isReady(item)</code> instead.</li>\n<li>Fix <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/5171\">#5171</a>: Removed Camel-K extension, use <a href=\"https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.apache.camel.k/camel-k-crds\"><code>org.apache.camel.k:camel-k-crds</code></a> instead.</li>\n<li>Fix <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/5262\">#5262</a>: Built-in resources were in-consistent with respect to their serialization or empty collections.  In many circumstances this was confusing behavior.  In order to be consistent all built-in resources will omit empty collections by default.  This is a breaking change if you are relying on an empty collection in a json merge or a strategic merge where the list has a patchStrategy of atomic.  In these circumstances the empty collection will no longer be serialized.  You may instead use a json patch, server side apply instead, or modify the serialized form of the patch.</li>\n<li>Fix <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/5279\">#5279</a>: (java-generator) Add native support for <code>date-time</code> fields, they are now mapped to native <code>java.time.ZonedDateTime</code></li>\n<li>Fix <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/5315\">#5315</a>: kubernetes-junit-jupiter no longer registers the NamespaceExtension and KubernetesExtension extensions to be used in combination with junit-platform.properties&gt;<code>junit.jupiter.extensions.autodetection.enabled=true</code>configuration.

In many circumstances this was confusing behavior.  In order to be consistent all built-in resources will omit empty collections by default.  This is a breaking change if you are relying on an empty collection in a json merge or a strategic merge where the list has a patchStrategy of atomic.  In these circumstances the empty collection will no longer be serialized.  You may instead use a json patch, server side apply instead, or modify the serialized form of the patch.</li>\n<li>Fix <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/5279\">#5279</a>: (java-generator) Add native support for <code>date-time</code> fields, they are now mapped to native <code>java.time.ZonedDateTime</code></li>\n<li>Fix <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/5315\">#5315</a>: kubernetes-junit-jupiter no longer registers the NamespaceExtension and KubernetesExtension extensions to be used in combination with junit-platform.properties&gt;<code>junit.jupiter.extensions.autodetection.enabled=true</code>configuration.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-31T04:39:47Z","updated_at":"2023-08-09T06:00:26Z","closed_at":"2023-08-09T06:00:25Z","merged_at":"2023-08-09T06:00:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"8bfdf1e38c8943fca68113b810e63aeb5e850303","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12815/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12815/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12815/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9cf2ccec06fe21eede44b410d0553094b1adb81d","head":{"label":"icodening:http12_server","ref":"http12_server","sha":"9cf2ccec06fe21eede44b410d0553094b1adb81d","user":{"login":"icodening","id":42876375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODc2Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42876375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening","html_url":"https://github.com/icodening","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":460051832,"node_id":"R_kgDOG2vVeA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"icodening/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icodening","id":42876375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODc2Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42876375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/user

-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-30T07:36:03Z","updated_at":"2023-08-14T08:00:13Z","closed_at":"2023-08-14T07:42:40Z","merged_at":"2023-08-14T07:42:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"629bee39873295669a482fbfabcf9b31d25526da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12814/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12814/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12814/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/07f18cb731ea1428ec1c376d9ee6e365aae4ab0d","head":{"label":"conghuhu:brave","ref":"brave","sha":"07f18cb731ea1428ec1c376d9ee6e365aae4ab0d","user":{"login":"conghuhu","id":56248584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56248584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu","html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":544346536,"node_id":"R_kgDOIHIRqA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"conghuhu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"conghuhu","id":56248584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56248584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu","html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-29T11:19:35Z","updated_at":"2023-07-29T12:46:28Z","closed_at":"2023-07-29T12:46:28Z","merged_at":"2023-07-29T12:46:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"2e04208405927c95de0e4c9c373041d2da867235","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12813/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12813/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12813/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f7a7bbe99efe8f8fe68288fdfe6141a2db445c2a","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0729-qos","ref":"0729-qos","sha":"f7a7bbe99efe8f8fe68288fdfe6141a2db445c2a","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-29T07:31:15Z","updated_at":"2023-07-29T11:19:43Z","closed_at":"2023-07-29T11:19:43Z","merged_at":"2023-07-29T11:19:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"97227e4e8e1a877d5356ffccbfd10de78493cd3a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12812/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12812/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12812/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/16701e66e18872c0a4c315e4b9c6cb1e39efedd4","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0729-config","ref":"0729-config","sha":"16701e66e18872c0a4c315e4b9c6cb1e39efedd4","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-27T11:36:07Z","updated_at":"2023-08-02T10:15:24Z","closed_at":"2023-08-02T09:30:32Z","merged_at":"2023-08-02T09:30:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"521b3e01460a70cc8c823e4e8c07f3cff56bc0c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12805/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12805/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12805/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1a5746b670b17b92322611ec6c65c51714f98341","head":{"label":"icodening:fix_leak","ref":"fix_leak","sha":"1a5746b670b17b92322611ec6c65c51714f98341","user":{"login":"icodening","id":42876375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODc2Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42876375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening","html_url":"https://github.com/icodening","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":460051832,"node_id":"R_kgDOG2vVeA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"icodening/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icodening","id":42876375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODc2Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42876375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening","html_url":"https://github.com/icodening","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icodening/dubbo","description":"Apache

-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-26T11:38:18Z","updated_at":"2023-07-29T12:28:23Z","closed_at":"2023-07-29T12:28:22Z","merged_at":"2023-07-29T12:28:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"25547158d2d77ac7caadcba64cf09f1ce711b7d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12799/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12799/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12799/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/07bc1fc0f67917a4c462cbc664439b81bfbb018a","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.2-add-protobuf-onClass","ref":"3.2-add-protobuf-onClass","sha":"07bc1fc0f67917a4c462cbc664439b81bfbb018a","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nWhen the zookeeper is disconnected, the dubbo actor check registry health will be stuck instead of returning to Down\r\nI hope the result is to return to the Down state\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the isAvailable method calls the getServices method of zookeeper, causing continuous retries. When determining whether it is available, it is necessary to first determine whether it is connected before obtaining it.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1、Fix the issue of timeout for all calls to the isAvailable method after the zookeeper is disconnected\r\n2、Move the isAvailable of NopServiceDiscovery into its own implementation class\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nStart the service, use pfctl or iptables to disconnect zookeeper, and it can return to the down state normally.\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-26T03:10:50Z","updated_at":"2023-07-26T04:05:26Z","closed_at":"2023-07-26T03:10:54Z","merged_at":"2023-07-26T03:10:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"9837cfbb0b4e008d976aa02a7a8c0730b4fa3514","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12795/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12795/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12795/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7c56899fa9460acf1b3a57e1d8fcd625396eacac","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0726_register","ref":"0726_register","sha":"7c56899fa9460acf1b3a57e1d8fcd625396eacac","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-26T03:09:51Z","updated_at":"2023-07-26T04:08:35Z","closed_at":"2023-07-26T03:09:55Z","merged_at":"2023-07-26T03:09:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"5caa8524a9a55d18145dec6c39cc886b89c84a96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12794/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12794/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12794/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/50e9b05cda86f80579a50864dd6d7c94f6f83e2d","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0726_check_-1","ref":"0726_check_-1","sha":"50e9b05cda86f80579a50864dd6d7c94f6f83e2d","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-25T11:13:29Z","updated_at":"2023-07-26T11:53:07Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a74b55cba9c4efd8df110bafd9917306748cb7b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12792/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12792/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12792/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7096661873b61dc26cabcaa22e6ad38b82dab599","head":{"label":"xixingya:feature/230725-bugfix","ref":"feature/230725-bugfix","sha":"7096661873b61dc26cabcaa22e6ad38b82dab599","user":{"login":"xixingya","id":37765666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzY1NjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37765666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya","html_url":"https://github.com/xixingya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":652581941,"node_id":"R_kgDOJuWcNQ","name":"dubbo","full_name":"xixingya/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xixingya","id":37765666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzY1NjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37765666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya","html_url":"https://github.com/xixingya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixingya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xixingya/dubbo","description":"Apache

dubbo-spi-extensions. The jsonrpc4j not used in dubbo-dependencies-bom will overwrite the version in the dubbo-http-rpc module\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-21T03:20:26Z","updated_at":"2023-07-25T13:09:48Z","closed_at":"2023-07-25T13:09:48Z","merged_at":"2023-07-25T13:09:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"3c5cb3bc0161426e39f83eeab8405745913a5b38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12772/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12772/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12772/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ae1d7a8094c034daae2f6afd474f1ab7f5649e40","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.2-remove-jsonrpc4j","ref":"3.2-remove-jsonrpc4j","sha":"ae1d7a8094c034daae2f6afd474f1ab7f5649e40","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-21T02:18:14Z","updated_at":"2023-07-28T06:13:53Z","closed_at":"2023-07-28T06:13:53Z","merged_at":"2023-07-28T06:13:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"ee05d54f92787088fdebb41292c5bff9df3c6498","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12771/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12771/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12771/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4e7e9b5c754c63ad0046e5dac3e6b80afebbd9a8","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:feat/support_real_exception","ref":"feat/support_real_exception","sha":"4e7e9b5c754c63ad0046e5dac3e6b80afebbd9a8","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-21T01:04:13Z","updated_at":"2023-07-31T02:25:03Z","closed_at":"2023-07-31T02:25:03Z","merged_at":"2023-07-31T02:25:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"10870708eb99a10fcfb25f71138e8d43cde566c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12770/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12770/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12770/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a3b36e40c03b1c66b76150aafaa0c9a69d43dc19","head":{"label":"songxiaosheng:feature/remove_jvm_application_name","ref":"feature/remove_jvm_application_name","sha":"a3b36e40c03b1c66b76150aafaa0c9a69d43dc19","user":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":534049587,"node_id":"R_kgDOH9TzMw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"songxiaosheng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-20T09:26:28Z","updated_at":"2023-07-26T05:59:10Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12766/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12766/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12766/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b383d216a1685af1dd77ef6d2991947a94c07a60","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0720_context","ref":"0720_context","sha":"b383d216a1685af1dd77ef6d2991947a94c07a60","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation
