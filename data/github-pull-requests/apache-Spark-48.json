What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch adss a new mechanism to push query execution progress for batch queries. We add a new response message type and periodically push query progress to the client. The client can consume this data to for example display a progress bar.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds support for displaying a progress bar in the PySpark shell when started with Spark Connect.\r\n\r\nThe proto message is defined as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// This message is used to communicate progress about the query progress during the execution.\r\n  // This message is used to communicate progress about the query progress during the execution.\r\n  message ExecutionProgress {\r\n    // Captures the progress of each individual stage.\r\n    repeated StageInfo stages = 1;\r\n\r\n    // Captures the currently in progress tasks.\r\n    int64 num_inflight_tasks = 2;\r\n\r\n    message StageInfo {\r\n      int64 stage_id = 1;\r\n      int64 num_tasks = 2;\r\n      int64 num_completed_tasks = 3;\r\n      int64 input_bytes_read = 4;\r\n      bool done = 5;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nClients can simply ignore the messages or consume them. On top of that this adds additional capabilities to register a callback for progress tracking to the SparkSession.\r\n\r\n```\r\nhandler = lambda **kwargs: print(kwargs)\r\nspark.register_progress_handler(handler)\r\nspark.range(100).collect()\r\nspark.remove_progress_handler(handler)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Example 1\r\n![progress_medium_query_multi_stage mp4](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/3421/5eff1ec4-def2-4d39-8a75-13a6af784c99)\r\n\r\n#### Example 2\r\n![progress_bar mp4](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/3421/20638511-2da4-4bd6-83f2-da3b9f500bde)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsability and Experience\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nWhen the user opens the PySpark shell with Spark Connect mode, it will use the progress bar by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `HistoryServerSuite`'s `incomplete apps get refreshed` test case to start with empty `storeDir`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo fix a flakiness in `LevelDBBackendHistoryServerSuite` and `RocksDBBackendHistoryServerSuite`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nLevelDBBackendHistoryServerSuite\r\n...\r\ninfo] - incomplete apps get refreshed *** FAILED *** (15 seconds, 397 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   The code passed to eventually never returned normally. Attempted 43 times over 10.213112356000002 seconds. Last failure message: 4 did not equal 0. (HistoryServerSuite.scala:564)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nRocksDBBackendHistoryServerSuite\r\n...\r\n[info] - incomplete apps get refreshed *** FAILED *** (15 seconds, 339 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   The code passed to eventually never returned normally.

Only `incomplete apps get refreshed` test case doesn't clean up.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/5faa512bf8c7c268613220d93ae4733cdf734cd0/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/HistoryServerSuite.scala#L611-L612\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a single test-case change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a feature to the Python UDTF API to let the `analyze` method mark columns of the input table as \"pass-through\" to the output table. As a result, Catalyst may push filters referring to the output columns safely through the UDTF into the input table, substantially reducing data scan sizes in some cases.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@udtf\r\nclass Identity:\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def analyze(*args):\r\n        assert len(args) == 1\r\n        assert args[0].isTable\r\n        return AnalyzeResult(\r\n            schema=args[0].dataType,\r\n            withSinglePartition=True,\r\n            select=[\r\n                SelectedColumn(\r\n                    name=\"a\",\r\n                    forwardToOutputTable=True),\r\n                SelectedColumn(\r\n                    name=\"b\",\r\n                    forwardToOutputTable=True)\r\n            ])\r\n\r\n    def eval(self, row: Row):\r\n        yield row[\"a\"], row[\"b\"] + 1000\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the UDTF marks the columns \"a\" and \"b\" as pass-through columns to the output table. Then queries like the following will be able to push the `WHERE` clause down to the input table:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM Identity(TABLE(t)) WHERE a = 42;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis reduces the amount of data that must cross the JVM/Python boundary and opens the door for partition pruning and other optimizations on the underlying table scan.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add one more field to keys of `supportedFormat` in `IntervalUtils` because current implementation has duplicate keys that overwrites each other. For instance, the following keys are the same:\r\n```\r\n(YM.YEAR, YM.MONTH)\r\n...\r\n(DT.DAY, DT.HOUR)\r\n```\r\nbecause `YM.YEAR = DT.DAY = 0` and `YM.MONTH = DT.HOUR = 1`.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45127.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the incorrect error message when Spark cannot parse ANSI interval string. For example, the expected format should be some year-month format but Spark outputs day-time one:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> select interval '-\\t2-2\\t' year to month;\r\n\r\nInterval string does not match year-month format of `[+|-]d h`, `INTERVAL [+|-]'[+|-]d h' DAY TO HOUR` when cast to interval year to month: -\t2-2\t. (line 1, pos 16)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nselect interval '-\\t2-2\\t' year to month\r\n----------------^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the existing test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *IntervalUtilsSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand regenerating the golden files:\r\n```\r\n$ SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1 PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\n(cherry picked from commit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add one more field to keys of `supportedFormat` in `IntervalUtils` because current implementation has duplicate keys that overwrites each other. For instance, the following keys are the same:\r\n```\r\n(YM.YEAR, YM.MONTH)\r\n...\r\n(DT.DAY, DT.HOUR)\r\n```\r\nbecause `YM.YEAR = DT.DAY = 0` and `YM.MONTH = DT.HOUR = 1`.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45127.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the incorrect error message when Spark cannot parse ANSI interval string. For example, the expected format should be some year-month format but Spark outputs day-time one:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> select interval '-\\t2-2\\t' year to month;\r\n\r\nInterval string does not match year-month format of `[+|-]d h`, `INTERVAL [+|-]'[+|-]d h' DAY TO HOUR` when cast to interval year to month: -\t2-2\t. (line 1, pos 16)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nselect interval '-\\t2-2\\t' year to month\r\n----------------^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the existing test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *IntervalUtilsSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand regenerating the golden files:\r\n```\r\n$ SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1 PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\n(cherry picked from commit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n**tl;dr**\r\nThis PR fixes a bug related to an `exists` variable being lost after an incorrect subquery rewrite when `exists` is not used neither in grouping expressions nor in aggregate functions. We wrap such variable in `first()` agg func to not lose reference to it.\r\n\r\n**Motivation**\r\nImagine we had a plan with a subquery:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAggregate [a1#0] [CASE WHEN a1#0 IN (list#3999 []) THEN Hello ELSE Hi END AS strCol#13]\r\n:    +- LocalRelation <empty>, [b1#3, b2#4, b3#5]\r\n+ LocalRelation <empty>, [a1#0, a2#1, a3#2]\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring correlated subquery rewrite, the rule `RewritePredicateSubquery` would rewrite expression `a1#0 IN (list#3999 [])` into `exists#12` and replace the subquery with `ExistenceJoin`, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAggregate [a1#0] [CASE WHEN exists#12 THEN Hello ELSE Hi END AS strCol#13]\r\n+- Join ExistenceJoin(exists#12), (a1#0 = b1#3)\r\n     +- LocalRelation <empty>, [a1#0, a2#1, a3#2]\r\n     +- LocalRelation <empty>, [b1#3, b2#4, b3#5]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `exists#12` doesn't appear neither in the grouping expressions, nor is part of any aggregate function. This is an invalid aggregation. In particular, aggregate pushdown rule rewrite this plan into:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProject [CASE WHEN exists#12 THEN Hello WHEN true THEN Hi END AS strCol#13]\r\n+- AggregatePart [a1#0], true\r\n   +- AggregatePart [a1#0], false\r\n      +- Join ExistenceJoin(exists#12), (a1#0 = b1#3)\r\n         :- AggregatePart [a1#0], false\r\n         :     +- LocalRelation <empty>, [a1#0, a2#1, a3#2]\r\n         +- AggregatePart [b1#3], false\r\n               +- LocalRelation <empty>, [b1#3, b2#4, b3#5]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Solution** \r\nWe fix the problem by wrapping such `exists` attributes in `first()` function, which is Spark's executable of `any_value()`. Note that such `exists` is always functionally determined by grouping keys, and thus wrapping it in any aggregate function preserving its unique value is safe.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we only wrap `exists` attributes if they are referenced among aggregate expressions, but NOT within an aggregate function or its filter. Note that a new `exists` attribute cannot appear in groupingExpressions.\r\n\r\n**Original proposal (NOT used)**\r\nThe decision is to fix the bug in the `RewritePredicateSubquery` by enforcing the condition that newly introduced variables, if referenced among agg expressions, must either participate in aggregate functions, or appear in the grouping keys.\r\n\r\nWith the fix, the plan after `RewritePredicateSubquery` will look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAggregate [a1#0, exists#12] [CASE WHEN exists#12 THEN Hello ELSE Hi END AS strCol#13]\r\n+- Join ExistenceJoin(exists#12), (a1#0 = b1#3)\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe Variant datatype was added in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43707 but the equivalent PySpark type was not added. In this PR we add Variant to PySpark which allows us to create PySpark dataframes containing the Variant type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this PR, trying to create a dataframe containing a variant type results in\r\n`AssertionError: Undefined error message parameter for error class: CANNOT_PARSE_DATATYPE. Parameters: {'error': \"Undefined error message parameter for error class: CANNOT_PARSE_DATATYPE. Parameters: {'error': 'variant'}\"}`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new PySpark type tests involving

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIntroduce `spark.profile.show/dump` for SparkSession-based profiling for non-Spark-Connect. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSparkContext-based profiling has `sc.dump_profiles/show_profiles` for both perf and memory profiling.\r\nCurrently SparkSession-based has `spark.dump/showPerfProfiles` and `spark.dump/showMemoryProfiles` for perf and memory profiling separately.\r\nIt would be more consistent and user-friendly to consolidate them to a uniform interface as `spark.profile.dump/show`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. `spark.profile.show/dump` is supported, whereas (not-released yet) APIs below are removed\r\n-`spark.dumpPerfProfiles`\r\n-`spark.dumpMemoryProfiles`\r\n-`spark.showPerfProfiles`\r\n-`spark.showMemoryProfiles`\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.pyspark.udf.profiler\", \"perf\")  # enable cProfiler\r\n>>> \r\n>>> @udf(\"string\")\r\n... def f(x):\r\n...       return str(x)\r\n... \r\n>>> df = spark.range(10).select(f(col(\"id\")))\r\n>>> df.collect()\r\n[Row(f(id)='0'), ...]\r\n>>> spark.profile.show()\r\n============================================================\r\nProfile of UDF<id=2>\r\n============================================================\r\n...\r\n\r\n>>> spark.profile.show(type=\"memory\")\r\n>>> spark.profile.show(type=\"perf\")\r\n============================================================\r\nProfile of UDF<id=2>\r\n============================================================\r\n...\r\n\r\n>>> spark.profile.show(2,

spark.profile.show(2, type=\"memory\")\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add one more field to keys of `supportedFormat` in `IntervalUtils` because current implementation has duplicate keys that overwrites each other. For instance, the following keys are the same:\r\n```\r\n(YM.YEAR, YM.MONTH)\r\n...\r\n(DT.DAY, DT.HOUR)\r\n```\r\nbecause `YM.YEAR = DT.DAY = 0` and `YM.MONTH = DT.HOUR = 1`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the incorrect error message when Spark cannot parse ANSI interval string. For example, the expected format should be some year-month format but Spark outputs day-time one:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> select interval '-\\t2-2\\t' year to month;\r\n\r\nInterval string does not match year-month format of `[+|-]d h`, `INTERVAL [+|-]'[+|-]d h' DAY TO HOUR` when cast to interval year to month: -\t2-2\t. (line 1, pos 16)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nselect interval '-\\t2-2\\t' year to month\r\n----------------^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the existing test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *IntervalUtilsSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand regenerating the golden files:\r\n```\r\n$ SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1 PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis covers a corner case in the COUNT bug handling. Right now it is split across two rules (PullupCorrelatedPredicates and RewriteCorrelatedScalarSubquery), where the first marks potential COUNT bug subqueries, and the second performs more accurate detection. Both of them rely on the fact that Aggregate remains at the top of the subquery, which is usually a safe assumption. However, when the subquery can be constant folded, the aggregate gets replaced with the project and the second part of COUNT bug handling falls through.\r\n\r\nAn example when it happens: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-46743 -- involves a temp view, which gets inlined and allows us to constant fold the subquery. (Therefore, replacing the temp view with an actual table makes the query return correct results).\r\n\r\nThis PR makes sure that the Aggregate always remains on top of the subquery body until the RewriteCorrelatedScalarSubquery rule (we later still run constant folding, so the constant aggregates would be folded away at a later point).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCorrectness bug. See the reasoning above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nIncorrect results become fixed\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nQuery test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

currently capture metrics which include the number of files, bytes and rows for a task along with the updated partitions. \r\n This change captures metrics for each updated partition, reporting the partition sub-paths along with the number of files, bytes, and rows per partition for each task.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor Spark V1\r\n1. Update the `WriteTaskStatsTracker` implementation to associate a partition with the file during writing, and to track the number of rows written to each file.  The final stats now include a map of partitions and the associated partition stats\r\n2. Update the `WriteJobStatsTracker` implementation to capture the partition subpaths and to publish a new Event to the listener bus.  The processed stats aggregate the statistics for each partition\r\n3. Posting to the listener bus a `SparkListenerSQLPartitionMetrics` event is handled outside the writer\r\n\r\nFor Spark V2\r\n1. Writer would need to implement `PartitionMetricsCollector`\r\n2. Implementing writers are provided with a `PartitionMetricsWriteInfo` to aggregate the information\r\n3. Posting to the listener bus a `SparkListenerSQLPartitionMetrics` event is handled outside the writer\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis increases our understanding of written data by tracking the impact for each task on our datasets\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis makes partition-level data accessible through a new event.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIn addition to the new unit tests, this was run in a Kubernetes environment writing tables with differing partitioning strategies and validating the reported stats.  Unit tests using both `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand` and `InsertIntoHiveTable` now verify partition stats when dynamic partitioning is enabled.  We also verified that the aggregated partition metrics matched the existing metrics for number of files, bytes, and rows.\r\n\r\nThis was also tested with updates to Iceberg to verify that Iceberg batch writes could also capture and publish these metrics.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `scalastyle` and `check style` rules to ban `AtomicDoubleArray|CompoundOrdering`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAlthough Apache Spark uses `com.google.common.util.concurrent.*` and `com.google.common.collect.*`, we don't use `AtomicDoubleArray` and `CompoundOrdering`. This PR will prevent any future accidental usage. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git grep com.google.common.util.concurrent | wc -l\r\n      18\r\n\r\n$ git grep com.google.common.collect | wc -l\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUntil now the Spark Connect plugins where only implemented in Scala, this change makes it so that the interface is defined in Java and thus making it easier to be language independent.\r\n\r\nThis is a change for Spark 4.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCompatibility\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis patch changes the public visible interface for the extension interface of Spark Connect. Previously the interfaces where implemented as Traits in Scala, but for better compatibility it's migrated to Java. Due to the lack of a non-empty `Optional[Void]` in Java, the `Command` transformation now returns bool.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-02-15T08:43:18Z","updated_at":"2024-02-20T01:37:59Z","closed_at":"2024-02-20T01:37:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"df970b3156aca84c172248216ca844a606e758b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45114/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45114/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45114/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c1ea23c6d3382e2d728d68d56d971de6f6bd1899","head":{"label":"grundprinzip:compat_plugin","ref":"compat_plugin","sha":"c1ea23c6d3382e2d728d68d56d971de6f6bd1899","user":{"login":"grundprinzip","id":3421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip","html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":503900825,"node_id":"R_kgDOHgjqmQ","name":"spark","full_name":"grundprinzip/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"grundprinzip","id":3421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip","html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo improve code clarity and maintainability, I propose that we move all the variables that track mutable state and metrics for a streaming query into a separate class.  With this refactor, it would be easy to track and find all the mutable state a microbatch can have.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo improve code clarity and maintainability.  All the state and metrics that is needed for the execution lifecycle of a microbatch is consolidated into one class.  If we decide to modify or add additional state to a streaming query, it will be easier to determine 1) where to add it 2) what existing state are there.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests should suffice\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to spin off `yarn` and `connect` as a new test pipeline for the following:\r\n- To stabilize more by off-loading\r\n- To re-trigger easily in case of failures.\r\n- To isolate `yarn` module change and avoid triggering other module's tests like Kafka module.\r\n- To isolate `connect` module change and avoid triggering other module's tests like Kafka module.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n \r\nThese two modules are known to be flaky in various GitHub Action CI pipelines.\r\n-

This means that won't support cross-engine compatibility for now.\r\n\r\nI will add a PR soon to fix parquet filter pushdown. At first we will disable it completely for collated strings but we should look into using sort keys instead as min/max values to support pushdown later on.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace all `IllegalArgumentException` by `SparkIllegalArgumentException` in `sql/api` code base, and introduce new legacy error classes with the `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_` prefix.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo unify Spark SQL exception, and port Java exceptions on Spark exceptions with error classes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it can if user's code assumes some particular format of `IllegalArgumentException` messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running existing test suites like:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-02-14T11:25:11Z","updated_at":"2024-02-15T07:28:47Z","closed_at":"2024-02-15T07:28:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d959c3031b9aaacaeb9cf5ac54942bdab8ed9e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis change cleans up any dangling files tracked as being previously uploaded if they were cleaned up from the filesystem. The cleaning can happen due to a compaction racing in parallel with commit, where compaction completes after commit and a older version is loaded on the same executor.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe changes are needed to prevent RocksDB versionId mismatch errors (which require users to clean the checkpoint directory and retry the query). \r\n\r\nA particular scenario where this can happen is provided below: \r\n\r\n1. Version V1 is loaded on executor A, RocksDB State Store has 195.sst, 196.sst, 197.sst and 198.sst files. \r\n2. State changes are made, which result in creation of a new table file 200.sst. \r\n3. State store is committed as version V2. The SST file 200.sst (as 000200-8c80161a-bc23-4e3b-b175-cffe38e427c7.sst) is uploaded to DFS, and previous 4 files are reused. A new metadata file is created to track the exact SST files with unique IDs, and uploaded with RocksDB Manifest as part of V1.zip.\r\n4. Rocks DB compaction is triggered at the same time. The compaction creates a new L1 file (201.sst), and deletes existing 5 SST files.\r\n5. Spark Stage is retried. \r\n6. Version V1 is reloaded on the same executor. The local files are inspected, and 201.sst is deleted. The 4 SST files in version V1 are downloaded again to local file system. \r\n7. Any local files which are deleted (as part of version load) are also removed from local → DFS file upload tracking. **However, the files already deleted as a result of compaction are not removed from tracking. This is the bug which resulted in the failure.**\r\n8. State store is committed as version V1. However, the local mapping of SST files to DFS file path still has 200.sst in its tracking, hence the SST file is not re-uploaded. A new metadata file is created to track the exact SST files with unique IDs, and uploaded with the new RocksDB Manifest as part of V2.zip. (The V2.zip file is overwritten here atomically)\r\n9. A new executor tried to load version V2. However, the SST files in (1) are now incompatible with Manifest file in (6) resulting in the version Id mismatch failure. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit test cases to cover the scenario where some files were deleted on the file system.\r\n\r\nThe test case fails with the existing master with error `Mismatch in unique ID on table file 16`, and is successful with changes in this PR. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, the StreamingQueryListener for Connect runs on the server side.\r\n\r\nFrom the user point of view, the purpose of a listener is mainly to have a pushing mechanism that notifies them when queries start / end / make progress. Before, the server-side listener essentially loses this functionality.\r\n\r\nThe new listener will be running on the client side, with the server continuously pushing the new listener events to the client, and the client will call corresponding callback functions for different listener event types.\r\n\r\nThis is the first PR that defines the protocol of this new listener.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAdd client side listener which makes more sense.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNot for this one.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNo need for this one, new tests will be added later.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add a new test tag, `WebBrowserTest`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, several browser-based tests exist in multiple modules like the following. It's difficult to find and run them.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncommon/tags/src/test/java/org/apache/spark/tags/WebBrowserTest.java\r\ncore/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/ChromeUIHistoryServerSuite.scala\r\ncore/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/HistoryServerSuite.scala\r\ncore/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/ui/ChromeUISeleniumSuite.scala\r\ncore/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/ui/UISeleniumSuite.scala\r\nsql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/ui/UISeleniumSuite.scala\r\nsql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/streaming/ui/UISeleniumSuite.scala\r\nsql/hive-thriftserver/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/thriftserver/UISeleniumSuite.scala\r\nstreaming/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/streaming/UISeleniumSuite.scala\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, the previous `ChromeUITest` is designed to disable `ChromeUI*` suite and doesn't cover all `WebBroser` based test suite.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is a new test tag.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-02-12T22:46:18Z","updated_at":"2024-02-13T01:01:39Z","closed_at":"2024-02-13T01:01:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f66a5b922dffd69590682910fde052c48078ea56","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to update `docker-integration-tests` test module to use the latest `Guava` test dependency. Specifically,\r\n- Switch from `provided` dependency to `test` dependency\r\n- Upgrade from version `19.0` to `33.0.0-jre`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPreviously, `docker-integration-tests` uses `Guava 19.0` dependency as `provided` scope because `docker-java-core` is using `Guava 19.0` still.\r\n \r\n- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.docker-java/docker-java-core/3.3.4\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, `docker-integration-tests` is an integration test module.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-02-12T21:22:53Z","updated_at":"2024-02-13T01:05:58Z","closed_at":"2024-02-13T00:41:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"16323c945a70f902b9cb00bc5ee7c3373a96ce2c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45088/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45088/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45088/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/252494f01c12eb08434dd25d4723c6ec7b398ff3","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-47025","ref":"SPARK-47025","sha":"252494f01c12eb08434dd25d4723c6ec7b398ff3","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nInstead of posting allllllllll of the expected test output, just show the path to the test file and the number of blocks.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCompare the current behavior when an SQL test fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] - group-by.sql *** FAILED *** (2 seconds, 92 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   group-by.sql\r\n[info]   Array(\"-- Automatically generated by SQLQueryTestSuite\r\n[info]   \", \"CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW testData AS SELECT * FROM VALUES\r\n[info]   (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (null, 1), (3, null), (null, null)\r\n\r\n[hundreds and hundreds of lines of SQL test output snipped]\r\n\r\n[info]   0.0    2\r\n[info]   Infinity       2\r\n[info]   NaN    2\r\n[info]   \") had size 259 instead of expected size 262 Expected 262 blocks in result file but got 259. Try regenerate the result files. (SQLQueryTestSuite.scala:625)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo the behavior after this patch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] - group-by.sql *** FAILED *** (2 seconds, 10 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   group-by.sql\r\n[info]   Expected 262, but got 259 blocks in result file '.../spark/sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/results/group-by.sql.out'. Try regenerating the result files. (SQLQueryTestSuite.scala:627)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe I am missing something, but I don't think it helps anyone to see the whole test output file when the only things that are relevant are the file name and number of blocks.\r\n\r\nNote also how the current error message on `master` repeats the expected and actual number of blocks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI ran some SQL tests from the sbt console:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z \"group-by\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `kvstore` module by adding explicit `commons-lang3` test dependency and excluding `htmlunit-driver` from `org.scalatestplus` to use Apache Spark's explicit declaration.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/fa23d276e7e4ed94bf11d71f2e1daa22fe2238e5/pom.xml#L711-L716\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Spark 3.3.0 (SPARK-37282), `kvstore` uses `commons-lang3` test dependency like the following, but we didn't declare it explicitly so far.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/fa23d276e7e4ed94bf11d71f2e1daa22fe2238e5/common/kvstore/src/test/java/org/apache/spark/util/kvstore/LevelDBSuite.java#L33\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/fa23d276e7e4ed94bf11d71f2e1daa22fe2238e5/common/kvstore/src/test/java/org/apache/spark/util/kvstore/LevelDBIteratorSuite.java#L23\r\n\r\nPreviously, it was provided by some unused `htmlunit-driver`'s transitive dependency accidentally. This causes a weird situation which `kvstore` module starts to fail to compile when we upgrade `htmlunit-driver`. We need to fix this first.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mvn dependency:tree -pl common/kvstore\r\n...\r\n[INFO] |  \\- org.seleniumhq.selenium:htmlunit-driver:jar:4.12.0:test\r\n...\r\n[INFO] |        +- org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:jar:3.14.0:test\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is only a test dependency fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-02-10T05:46:46Z","updated_at":"2024-02-11T18:44:06Z","closed_at":"2024-02-11T18:38:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8ec64a6b32ef4a4869e7c618d79b041385c66453","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45080/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45080/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45080/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b667395cf3594ed6d15768bbc30f5b9301b55fdb","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-47021","ref":"SPARK-47021","sha":"b667395cf3594ed6d15768bbc30f5b9301b55fdb","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to add clustering column info as the output of `DESCRIBE TABLE`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, it's not easy to retrieve clustering column info; you can do it via catalog APIs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Now, when you run `DESCRIBE TABLE` on clustered tables, you will see the \"Clustering Information\" as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE tbl (col1 STRING, col2 INT) using parquet CLUSTER BY (col1, col2);\r\nDESC tbl;\r\n\r\n+------------------------+---------+-------+\r\n|col_name                |data_type|comment|\r\n+------------------------+---------+-------+\r\n|col1                    |string   |NULL   |\r\n|col2                    |int      |NULL   |\r\n|# Clustering Information|         |       |\r\n|# col_name              |data_type|comment|\r\n|col1                    |string   |NULL   |\r\n|col2                    |int      |NULL   |\r\n+------------------------+---------+-------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded new unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade Apache Ivy to 2.5.2 and protect old Ivy-based systems like old Spark from Apache Ivy 2.5.2's incompatibility by introducing a new `.ivy2.5.2` directory.\r\n\r\n- Apache Spark 4.0.0 will create this once and reuse this directory while all the other systems like old Sparks uses the old one, `.ivy2`. So, the behavior is the same with the case where Apache Spark 4.0.0 is installed and used in a new machine.\r\n\r\n- For the environments with `User-provided Ivy-path`es, the user might hit the incompatibility still. However, the users can mitigate them because they already have full control on `Ivy-path`es.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis was tried once and reverted logically due to Java 11 and Java 17 failures in Daily CIs.\r\n- #42613 \r\n- #42668\r\n\r\nCurrently, PR Builder also fails as of now. If the PR passes CIes, we can achieve the following.\r\n\r\n- [Release notes](https://lists.apache.org/thread/9gcz4xrsn8c7o9gb377xfzvkb8jltffr)\r\n    - FIX: CVE-2022-46751: Apache Ivy Is Vulnerable to XML External Entity Injections\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs including `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-02-09T09:09:17Z","updated_at":"2024-02-23T16:36:49Z","closed_at":"2024-02-23T16:36:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b859427d34d0bfa76873298a6bbfc323cee4fecc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45075/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45075/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45075/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/19e2d4ca867ff1df7678ceba9a667bb9870bbc3c","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-44914","ref":"SPARK-44914","sha":"19e2d4ca867ff1df7678ceba9a667bb9870bbc3c","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe proposed changes in this pr involve refactoring the `refill()` method in the `NioBufferedFileInputStream` class to `isExhausted()`. All calls to `!refill()` within the class have been updated to call `isExhausted()` instead.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes are needed to improve the readability and understandability of the code. Currently, the `refill()` method in `NioBufferedFileInputStream` is always invoked in a negated context (`!refill()`), which can be confusing and counter-intuitive. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds E2E support for `collate` and `collation` expressions.\r\nFollowing changes were made to get us there:\r\n1) Set the right ordering for `PhysicalStringType` based on `collationId`.\r\n2) UTF8String is now just a data holder class - it no longer implements `Comparable` interface. All comparisons must be done through `CollationFactory`.\r\n3) `collate` and `collation` expressions are added. Special syntax for `collate` is enabled - `'hello world' COLLATE 'target_collation'\r\n4) First set of tests is added that covers both core expression and E2E collation tests.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is part of larger collation track. For more details please refer to design doc attached in parent JIRA ticket.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThis test adds two new expressions and opens up new syntax.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nBasic tests are added. In follow up PRs we will add support for more advanced operators and keep adding tests alongside new feature support.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the Python UDTF API to check and return a better error message if the `analyze` method returns an `AnalyzeResult` object with an `orderBy` field erroneously set to a list of strings, rather than `OrderingColumn` instances.\r\n\r\nFor example, this UDTF accidentally sets the `orderBy` field in this way:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import AnalyzeResult, OrderingColumn, PartitioningColumn\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import IntegerType, Row, StructType\r\nclass Udtf:\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self._partition_col = None\r\n        self._count = 0\r\n        self._sum = 0\r\n        self._last = None\r\n\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def analyze(row: Row):\r\n        return AnalyzeResult(\r\n            schema=StructType()\r\n                .add(\"user_id\", IntegerType())\r\n                .add(\"count\", IntegerType())\r\n                .add(\"total\", IntegerType())\r\n                .add(\"last\", IntegerType()),\r\n            partitionBy=[\r\n                PartitioningColumn(\"user_id\")\r\n            ],\r\n            orderBy=[\r\n                \"timestamp\"\r\n            ],\r\n            )\r\n\r\n    def eval(self, row: Row):\r\n        self._partition_col = row[\"partition_col\"]\r\n        self._count += 1\r\n        self._last = row[\"input\"]\r\n        self._sum += row[\"input\"]\r\n\r\n    def terminate(self):\r\n        yield self._partition_col, self._count, self._sum, self._last\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis improves error messages and helps keep users from getting confused.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to detect and fails on invalid volume size.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis happens when the user forget the unit of volume size. For example, `100` instead of `100Gi`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nFor K8s volumes, the system is trying to use the system default minimum volume size. However it totally depends on the underlying system. And, this misconfiguration misleads the users in many cases because the job is started and running in unhealthy status.\r\n- First, the executor pods will be killed by the K8s control plane due to the out of disk situation.\r\n- Second, Spark is trying to create new executors (still with small disks) and to retry multiple times.\r\n\r\nWe had better detect the missed-unit situation and make those jobs fail as early as possible.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with newly added test cases.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use `getTotalMemorySize` instead of deprecated `getTotalPhysicalMemorySize` (OpenJDK) or `getTotalPhysicalMemory` (IBM Java) in `WorkerArguments`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`getTotalPhysicalMemorySize` is deprecated at Java 14 in OpenJDK.\r\n- https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/jdk.management/com/sun/management/OperatingSystemMXBean.html#getTotalPhysicalMemorySize()\r\n\r\n`getTotalPhysicalMemory` is deprecated since 1.8 in IBM.\r\n- https://eclipse.dev/openj9/docs/api/jdk17/jdk.management/com/ibm/lang/management/OperatingSystemMXBean.html#getTotalPhysicalMemory()\r\n\r\n`getTotalMemorySize` is recommended in both environments for Apache Spark 4.0.0 because the minimum Java version is 17.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with the existing test cases.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRemove the unconditional Alias node generation when resolving a variable reference.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAn Alias that is not at the top level of an expression blocks constant folding.\r\nConstant folding in turn is a requirement for variables to be usable as an argument to numerous functions, such as from_json().\r\nIt also has performance implications.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting regression tests in sql-session-variables.sql, added a test to validate the fix.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe plan/expression tree will be expanded during analysis, due to our implementation of the IDENTIFIER clause: we keep a lambda function in the plan/expression node to lazily return a new plan/expression.\r\n\r\nThis is usually fine, but doesn't work well with query parameter binding, which needs to see the entire plan/expression tree and bind all parameters at once. The feature EXECUTE IMMEDIATE also needs to see the entire plan tree to determine if it's a `PosParameterizedQuery` or `NameParameterizedQuery`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem for `ExpressionWithUnresolvedIdentifier`, to make the lambda function only return the expression node that needs the identifier, and other expressions should be kept in `ExpressionWithUnresolvedIdentifier` and passed to the lambda function later.\r\n\r\n`PlanWithUnresolvedIdentifier` will be fixed in a similar way in another PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make IDENTIFIER clause work with query parameter binding\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, certain queries can run now while they failed before. See the test\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to deprecate the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.allowZeroIndexInFormatString` and put it to the list `deprecatedSQLConfigs` in `SQLConf`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAfter migration on JDK 17+, the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.allowZeroIndexInFormatString` doesn't work anymore, and doesn't allow to use the zero index. Even users set the config to `true`, they get the error:\r\n```java\r\nIllegal format argument index = 0\r\njava.util.IllegalFormatArgumentIndexException: Illegal format argument index = 0\r\n\tat java.base/java.util.Formatter$FormatSpecifier.index(Formatter.java:2808)\r\n\tat java.base/java.util.Formatter$FormatSpecifier.<init>(Formatter.java:2879)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-02-07T08:40:51Z","updated_at":"2024-02-08T02:20:48Z","closed_at":"2024-02-08T02:20:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"82eb0981ec9c53223101affd8ae014a26d7d9cdc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45057/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45057/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45057/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/82688ca396bb3173ba47c5fb1ce5c025a3ef9116","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:deprecate-ALLOW_ZERO_INDEX_IN_FORMAT_STRING","ref":"deprecate-ALLOW_ZERO_INDEX_IN_FORMAT_STRING","sha":"82688ca396bb3173ba47c5fb1ce5c025a3ef9116","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to enable `spark.worker.cleanup.enabled` by default as a part of Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nApache Spark community has been recommending (from Apache Spark 3.0 to 3.5) to enable `spark.worker.cleanup.enabled` when `spark.shuffle.service.db.enabled` is true. And, `spark.shuffle.service.db.enabled` has been `true` since SPARK-26288.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/dc73a8d7e96ead55053096971c838908b7c90527/docs/spark-standalone.md?plain=1#L443\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/dc73a8d7e96ead55053096971c838908b7c90527/docs/spark-standalone.md?plain=1#L473\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/dc73a8d7e96ead55053096971c838908b7c90527/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/package.scala#L718-L724\r\n\r\nAlthough `spark.shuffle.service.enabled` is disabled by default, `spark.worker.cleanup.enabled` is crucial for long-standing Spark Standalone clusters to avoid the disk full situation.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/dc73a8d7e96ead55053096971c838908b7c90527/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/package.scala#L692-L696\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but this has been a long-standing recommended configuration in the real production-level Spark Standalone clusters.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-02-07T06:16:27Z","updated_at":"2024-02-08T06:51:44Z","closed_at":"2024-02-08T06:51:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"983cedd21dd0a5ac5bcbab297a66edb4795a7386","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45055/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45055/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45055/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/adca48fac8105ac74452b31a9ee3cd84c88b2214","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-46997","ref":"SPARK-46997","sha":"adca48fac8105ac74452b31a9ee3cd84c88b2214","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43435 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43760 are fixing a correctness issue which will be triggered when AQE applied on cached query plan, specifically, when AQE coalescing the final result stage of the cached plan.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe current semantic of `spark.sql.optimizer.canChangeCachedPlanOutputPartitioning`\r\n\r\n([source code](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/CacheManager.scala#L403-L411)):\r\n\r\nwhen true, we enable AQE, but disable coalescing final stage (default)\r\nwhen false, we disable AQE\r\n \r\n\r\nBut let’s revisit the semantic of this config: actually for caller the only thing that matters is whether we change the output partitioning of the cached plan. And we should only try to apply AQE if possible.  Thus we want to modify the semantic of spark.sql.optimizer.canChangeCachedPlanOutputPartitioning\r\n\r\nwhen true, we enable AQE and allow coalescing final: this might lead to perf regression, because it introduce extra shuffle\r\nwhen false, we enable AQE, but disable coalescing final stage. (this is actually the `true` semantic of old behavior)\r\nAlso, to keep the default behavior unchanged, we might want to flip the default value of spark.sql.optimizer.canChangeCachedPlanOutputPartitioning to `false`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo allow AQE coalesce final stage in SQL cached plan. Also make the semantic of `spark.sql.optimizer.canChangeCachedPlanOutputPartitioning` more reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated UTs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-07T04:46:44Z","updated_at":"2024-02-07T18:21:13Z","closed_at":"2024-02-07T12:04:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d9834e82243bbef32a2914550f9a2e3a7b55b25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45054/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45054/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45054/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/50add8dbfb8c43f1a73b941f4080aad4f54377e7","head":{"label":"liuzqt:SPARK-46995","ref":"SPARK-46995","sha":"50add8dbfb8c43f1a73b941f4080aad4f54377e7","user":{"login":"liuzqt","id":22358241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzU4MjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22358241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzqt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":511387078,"node_id":"R_kgDOHnslxg","name":"spark","full_name":"liuzqt/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuzqt","id":22358241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzU4MjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22358241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzqt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuzqt/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to release a separate `pyspark-connect` package, see also [SPIP: Pure Python Package in PyPI (Spark Connect)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pund40wGRuB72LX6L7cliMDVoXTPR-xx4IkPmMLaZXk/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\nToday's PySpark package is roughly as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\npyspark\r\n├── *.py               # *Core / No Spark Connect support*\r\n├── mllib              # MLlib / No Spark Connect support\r\n├── resource           # Resource profile API / No Spark Connect support\r\n├── streaming          # DStream (deprecated) / No Spark Connect support\r\n├── ml                 # ML \r\n│   └── connect            # Spark Connect for ML\r\n├── pandas             # API on Spark with/without Spark Connect support\r\n└── sql                # SQL\r\n    └── connect            # Spark Connect for SQL\r\n        └── streaming      # Spark Connect for Structured Streaming\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere will be two packages available, `pyspark` and `pyspark-connect`.\r\n\r\n#### `pyspark`\r\n\r\nSame as today’s PySpark. But Core module is factored out to `pyspark.core.*`. User-facing interface stays the same at `pyspark.*`.\r\n\r\n```\r\npyspark\r\n├── core               # *Core / No Spark Connect support*\r\n├── mllib              # MLlib / No Spark Connect support\r\n├── resource           # Resource profile API / No Spark Connect support\r\n├── streaming          # DStream (deprecated) / No Spark Connect support\r\n├── ml                 # ML \r\n│   └── connect            # Spark Connect for ML\r\n├── pandas             # API on Spark with/without Spark Connect support\r\n└── sql                # SQL\r\n    └── connect            # Spark Connect for SQL\r\n        └── streaming      # Spark Connect for Structured Streaming\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### `pyspark-connect`\r\n\r\nPackage after excluding modules that do not support Spark Connect, also excluding jars, that are, ml without jars:\r\n\r\n```\r\npyspark\r\n├── ml\r\n│   └── connect\r\n├── pandas\r\n└── sql\r\n    └── connect\r\n        └── streaming\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo provide a pure Python library that does not depend on JVM.\r\n\r\nSee also [SPIP: Pure Python Package in PyPI (Spark Connect)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pund40wGRuB72LX6L7cliMDVoXTPR-xx4IkPmMLaZXk/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users can install pure Python library via `pip install pyspark-connect`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested the basic set of tests.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./sbin/start-connect-server.sh --jars `ls connector/connect/server/target/**/spark-connect*SNAPSHOT.jar`\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd python\r\npython packaging/connect/setup.py sdist\r\ncd dist\r\nconda create -y -n clean-py-3.11 python=3.11\r\nconda activate clean-py-3.11\r\npip install pyspark-connect-4.0.0.dev0.tar.gz\r\npython\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pyspark\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\n>>> spark = SparkSession.builder.remote(\"sc://localhost\").getOrCreate()\r\n>>> spark.range(10).show()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n+---+\r\n| id|\r\n+---+\r\n|  0|\r\n|  1|\r\n|  2|\r\n|  3|\r\n|  4|\r\n|  5|\r\n|  6|\r\n|  7|\r\n|  8|\r\n|  9|\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThey will be separated added, and set as a scheduled job in CI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-02-07T04:46:14Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T02:23:25Z","closed_at":"2024-04-04T02:23:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"695c7cb12c31c50ee4d118a17763edba8f48985b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED
