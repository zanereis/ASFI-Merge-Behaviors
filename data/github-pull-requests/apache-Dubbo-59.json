quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-28T15:41:42Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T02:31:24Z","closed_at":"2019-07-17T02:31:24Z","merged_at":"2019-07-17T02:31:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"63d33d1fbc1258f72b73e169eb90bd41ac0da44c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4424/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4424/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4424/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/030e0620b82ca7caf1d0367fbbc813ac2a382ed7","head":{"label":"danielamorais:feature/dubbo-cluster-improve-java-doc","ref":"feature/dubbo-cluster-improve-java-doc","sha":"030e0620b82ca7caf1d0367fbbc813ac2a382ed7","user":{"login":"danielamorais","id":8279779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzk3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8279779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais","html_url":"https://github.com/danielamorais","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":178013977,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzgwMTM5Nzc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"danielamorais/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"danielamorais","id":8279779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzk3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8279779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais","html_url":"https://github.com/danielamorais","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/danielamorais/dubbo","description":"Apache

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-27T06:15:48Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T02:37:24Z","closed_at":"2019-07-05T01:27:21Z","merged_at":"2019-07-05T01:27:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"f456745423138c0a6db89a4f4c1b1e4ba26bc51d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4411/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4411/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4411/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9163a6d1058945c2e52fa428a94cf57b66545c1f","head":{"label":"chickenlj:configcenterconfig-3872","ref":"configcenterconfig-3872","sha":"9163a6d1058945c2e52fa428a94cf57b66545c1f","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-27T02:12:35Z","updated_at":"2019-07-08T07:03:24Z","closed_at":"2019-07-04T09:23:12Z","merged_at":"2019-07-04T09:23:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"6667a6f7ff44131f74d3af84326a0b645f1782cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/26","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/26","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/26/labels","id":4307099,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDMwNzA5OQ==","number":26,"title":"2.7.3","description":"1.

now returns an empty `byte[]`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nA new test case was added in `BytesTest.java`\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-26T08:10:40Z","updated_at":"2019-06-28T07:39:57Z","closed_at":"2019-06-28T07:39:57Z","merged_at":"2019-06-28T07:39:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"b5408b752631644d5934971f4ba11d165c776536","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/26","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/26","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/26/labels","id":4307099,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDMwNzA5OQ==","number":26,"title":"2.7.3","description":"1.

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfixes https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/4338\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nrun https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples/tree/master/dubbo-samples-compatible\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-25T10:35:49Z","updated_at":"2019-07-01T02:54:12Z","closed_at":"2019-07-01T02:54:12Z","merged_at":"2019-07-01T02:54:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"69a0483c949b3d9ea384264b9f89539674cdef13","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/26","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/26","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/26/labels","id":4307099,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDMwNzA5OQ==","number":26,"title":"2.7.3","description":"1.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nrelated issues: https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/4247\r\n\r\ndocs: https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website/pull/388\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-25T07:12:24Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T02:38:25Z","closed_at":"2019-07-04T09:20:39Z","merged_at":"2019-07-04T09:20:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"c4e94958fd886994d2dfb78f28f0a77c52a5e7e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4388/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4388/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4388/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e9371fdfad7737e7ee1581587dec8f93a744f9b4","head":{"label":"chickenlj:configcenter-model","ref":"configcenter-model","sha":"e9371fdfad7737e7ee1581587dec8f93a744f9b4","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-25T06:36:41Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T02:46:00Z","closed_at":"2019-07-17T02:46:00Z","merged_at":"2019-07-17T02:46:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"fba25d271fe4672a5dceef288f4e1cf2ea923521","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4387/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4387/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4387/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/12a3863acc3dac458ad5e4d5c5f0f4df84629d17","head":{"label":"zhenxianyimeng:dev","ref":"dev","sha":"12a3863acc3dac458ad5e4d5c5f0f4df84629d17","user":{"login":"zhenxianyimeng","id":15272909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjcyOTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15272909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenxianyimeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":193426363,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTM0MjYzNjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"zhenxianyimeng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhenxianyimeng","id":15272909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjcyOTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15272909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenxianyimeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhenxianyimeng/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-25T05:07:20Z","updated_at":"2019-07-03T02:43:51Z","closed_at":"2019-07-03T02:43:51Z","merged_at":"2019-07-03T02:43:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"a42fb1535d45fe372e21515f4941002423c22fb5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4386/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4386/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4386/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ca0647417aaca8faa416287a6964c8aba2a45063","head":{"label":"felixz7:master","ref":"master","sha":"ca0647417aaca8faa416287a6964c8aba2a45063","user":{"login":"felixz7","id":16345433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzQ1NDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16345433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7","html_url":"https://github.com/felixz7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63161796,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzE2MTc5Ng==","name":"dubbo","full_name":"felixz7/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"felixz7","id":16345433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzQ1NDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16345433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7","html_url":"https://github.com/felixz7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixz7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/felixz7/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/4351\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nif remoteapplicationname is null should get applicationname\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue.

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-24T10:47:44Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T06:26:36Z","closed_at":"2019-06-26T06:26:36Z","merged_at":"2019-06-26T06:26:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"e1ce4bc64d27256826a7d25737956be7f5633186","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/26","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/26","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/26/labels","id":4307099,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDMwNzA5OQ==","number":26,"title":"2.7.3","description":"1.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

this change\r\n\r\nrun org.apache.dubbo.common.extension.ExtensionLoaderTest#test_LoadExtension_Duplicate\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-20T04:40:30Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T03:15:29Z","closed_at":"2019-07-17T03:15:28Z","merged_at":"2019-07-17T03:15:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"e3c9bed84b7ebab124009ebbe4565fd6020b2822","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4358/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4358/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4358/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/557044bce1bf32f2c938adfb365ef967f758347c","head":{"label":"HzjNeverStop:bugfix/etcd3_registry_cancel_watch","ref":"bugfix/etcd3_registry_cancel_watch","sha":"557044bce1bf32f2c938adfb365ef967f758347c","user":{"login":"HzjNeverStop","id":19757574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzU3NTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19757574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop","html_url":"https://github.com/HzjNeverStop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"60c9d9dbbc8db2dccc019df82d7a9194d4ccbdfa","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organiza

and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-20T04:08:54Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T11:25:08Z","closed_at":"2019-06-20T15:06:42Z","merged_at":"2019-06-20T15:06:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"ae22f9ec283cf6f5d9c0f3a307510e3fa7f94930","assignee":{"login":"htynkn","id":659135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTEzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/659135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn","html_url":"https://github.com/htynkn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"htynkn","id":659135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTEzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/659135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn","html_url":"https://github.com/htynkn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/26","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/26","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/26/labels","id":4307099,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDMwNzA5OQ==","number":26,"title":"2.7.3","description":"1.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-19T06:29:49Z","updated_at":"2019-07-01T06:04:02Z","closed_at":"2019-06-28T08:44:55Z","merged_at":"2019-06-28T08:44:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"9b7c6975a4f8298d3991ee73635eeecc026107cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/26","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/26","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/26/labels","id":4307099,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDMwNzA5OQ==","number":26,"title":"2.7.3","description":"1.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n我发现在调用被代理的方法时，使用的参数名是该方法自身定义的旧的参数名，然而我们在生成代理类的过程中重载该方法时已经将参数名重新定义为arg为首，index为尾的参数名，例如arg0,arg1...。当使用旧的参数名调用被代理方法时，编译会出现错误，因为我们的局部变量之中已经不存在旧的参数名了，所以在调用被代理方法时应该使用新的参数名。\r\nI found that when calling the proxy method, the parameter name used is the old parameter name defined by the method itself. However, when we overload the method in the process of generating the proxy class, we have redefined the parameter name as arg first and index tail, such as arg0, arg1.... When the proxy method is called with the old parameter name, compilation errors occur because the old parameter name does not exist in our local variables, so we should use the new parameter name when calling the proxy method.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it).

there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nci\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nremove getExecutorService method cexecutor local variables\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdapt non-camelcase property name to camelcase. In a gateway application the data from legacy application such as php is non-camelcase style, but in general java use camelcase. This is complex to convert them in user application, it is necessary to provide the function in Dubbo.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAdd GenericAlias annotation.\r\nchange PojoUtils class, change the realize and generalize method.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/4286) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-13T08:55:07Z","updated_at":"2021-05-22T07:38:48Z","closed_at":"2021-05-22T07:38:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"94c665512df2ff96781d3fd92d214105a9d88b10","assignee":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

Verifying this change\r\n\r\norg.apache.dubbo.registry.supportAbstractRegistryFactory\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Issue: #4277 \r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nDubbo 2.7.2 duplicate decrease for the ExecuteLimitFilter and ActiveLimitFilter, once service throws exception.\r\n\r\nFirst time decrease:\r\nmethodStatus count has been decreased once it's exceed max executes/actives.\r\n```\r\npublic class RpcStatus {\r\n    public static boolean beginCount(URL url, String methodName, int max) {\r\n        ...\r\n        if (methodStatus.active.incrementAndGet() > max) {\r\n            methodStatus.active.decrementAndGet();\r\n            return false;\r\n        } else {\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond time decrease.\r\nListener callback will decrease the executes/actives again.\r\n```\r\nstatic class ExecuteLimitListener implements Listener {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onError(Throwable t, Invoker<?> invoker, Invocation invocation) {\r\n            RpcStatus.endCount(invoker.getUrl(), invocation.getMethodName(), getElapsed(invocation), false);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nstop to decrease the executes/actives from RpcStatus#beginCount.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nStep 1: set executes to 1 in dubbo:service\r\n```\r\n<bean id=\"demoService\" class=\"com.xxx.\"/>\r\n<dubbo:service interface=\"com.xxx\" ref=\"demoService\" executes=\"1\">\r\n</dubbo:service>\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 2: \r\nInvoke service with two threads concurrent. The second one have been rate limited. \r\n```\r\nExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\r\n  executorService.submit(new Runnable() {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void run() {\r\n      String result = service.sayHello(input);\r\n      System.out.println(result);\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 3:\r\nRepeat step 2, all two requests have been passed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-10T07:36:19Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T09:31:41Z","closed_at":"2019-07-17T09:31:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"031771817a6fb6a16fc6e777dad91131c3310f0a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4272/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4272/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4272/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/055124c397e058dd47d9c88433f7feb6c906c025","head":{"label":"owen200008:master","ref":"master","sha":"055124c397e058dd47d9c88433f7feb6c906c025","user":{"login":"owen200008","id":7434837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MzQ4Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7434837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008","html_url":"https://github.com/owen200008","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"3acf5b8af129f58b31bcdae876ce4c73f520e161","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

change\r\n\r\nci\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-05T10:26:19Z","updated_at":"2019-06-05T10:41:41Z","closed_at":"2019-06-05T10:41:40Z","merged_at":"2019-06-05T10:41:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"b2dbc5ef5da92e3ee5eba06d64a8e00446dd65c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4257/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4257/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4257/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f26ae6dda37934205f8938e9f5132a603180ebb8","head":{"label":"chickenlj:DefaultFuture-Jeff","ref":"DefaultFuture-Jeff","sha":"f26ae6dda37934205f8938e9f5132a603180ebb8","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-03T09:02:59Z","updated_at":"2019-06-03T09:03:55Z","closed_at":"2019-06-03T09:03:55Z","merged_at":"2019-06-03T09:03:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"b20f72e1051ce4d837232729380aec3283ca4fb2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4240/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4240/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4240/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5141b41b27533674feaf0cbbc88d4031a6ca3a2f","head":{"label":"chickenlj:perf-reduce-string-allocation","ref":"perf-reduce-string-allocation","sha":"5141b41b27533674feaf0cbbc88d4031a6ca3a2f","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nci\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-03T04:32:21Z","updated_at":"2021-05-22T07:38:38Z","closed_at":"2021-05-22T07:38:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0b072cc83698abf657d69b79d1d1993508dcae63","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-03T04:01:08Z","updated_at":"2019-06-03T08:24:59Z","closed_at":"2019-06-03T08:24:59Z","merged_at":"2019-06-03T08:24:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"0b275651aa461dd241b77eaead7fd48fb656de47","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4236/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4236/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4236/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/539b6c3fa25efe00e86b319dab2c7b5af31b9fa5","head":{"label":"web1992:fix-tag-router-rule-npe","ref":"fix-tag-router-rule-npe","sha":"539b6c3fa25efe00e86b319dab2c7b5af31b9fa5","user":{"login":"web1992","id":6828647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4Mjg2NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6828647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992","html_url":"https://github.com/web1992","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":182223960,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODIyMjM5NjA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"web1992/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"web1992","id":6828647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4Mjg2NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6828647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992","html_url":"https://github.com/web1992","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web1992/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/web1992/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-31T13:29:47Z","updated_at":"2021-04-12T12:06:04Z","closed_at":"2021-04-12T12:06:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c477b8cbb0b94264411d41a2f5dd39c9efddafd5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4229/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4229/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4229/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/23cdd9aea034013b1d035f8ad21e95e507ecde6b","head":{"label":"slievrly:plugin","ref":"plugin","sha":"23cdd9aea034013b1d035f8ad21e95e507ecde6b","user":{"login":"slievrly","id":8758457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTg0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8758457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly","html_url":"https://github.com/slievrly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166805208,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjY4MDUyMDg=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"slievrly/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"slievrly","id":8758457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTg0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8758457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly","html_url":"https://github.com/slievrly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slievrly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/slievrly/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:12:27Z","updated_at":"2021-07-14T07:44:49Z","closed_at":"2019-12-20T08:36:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1bc6cb557cfaf1a0eb928a1021b1cd15703f478a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4225/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4225/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4225/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/fc2230475b3a7818265ae66c1884c83f5853372e","head":{"label":"jcsxky:master","ref":"master","sha":"fc2230475b3a7818265ae66c1884c83f5853372e","user":{"login":"jcsxky","id":8766380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjYzODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8766380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcsxky","html_url":"https://github.com/jcsxky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcsxky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcsxky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcsxky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcsxky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcsxky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcsxky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcsxky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcsxky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcsxky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"7f7a28987853aa511ba18ab3647c34187e88230f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation
