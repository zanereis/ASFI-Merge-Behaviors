Defines a URN, `beam:coder:row:v1`, to represent row coder as a standard coder.\r\n- Implements row coder as a standard coder in Java (previously it was a custom coder). It is now serialized to a portable representation based on the Schema specification defined in https://s.apache.org/beam-schemas\r\n- Adds very basic support for Beam Schemas in the Python SDK based on `typing` (detailed below)\r\n- Implements row coder in Python (currently only strings, integers, doubles, and lists are supported)\r\n- Adds some simple test cases for row coder to `standard_coders.yaml` to verify compatibility between the Java and Python implementations.\r\n\r\n### Beam Schemas in Python\r\nAs noted above this PR adds basic support for Beam Schemas in Python. Currently this relies on Python's `typing` module as a native Python representation of Beam Schemas. \r\n\r\n`apache_beam.typehints.schemas` includes two functions, `typing_from_runner_api` and `typing_to_runner_api` which convert supported typing instances to/from portable schemas. Primitive types are mapped to numpy types (e.g. `np.int32`, `np.double`), Arrays are mapped to `typing.List[T]`, Maps are mapped to `typing.Mapping[K,V]`, and Rows are mapped to `typing.NamedTuple`.  Logical types are not yet supported. \r\n\r\nWith the changes in this PR it's possible to use Python's row coder for simple structured data types with code like the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport apache_beam as beam\r\nfrom apache_beam import coders\r\nfrom typing import NamedTuple\r\nfrom typing import Optional\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nclass Movie(NamedTuple):\r\n  name: np.unicode\r\n  year: Optional[np.int16]\r\n\r\n# The class/type annotation syntax doesn't work in Python 2. Instead you can use:\r\n# Movie = NamedTuple('Movie', [('name', np.unicode), ('year', Optional[np.int16])]\r\n\r\ncoders.registry.register_coder(Movie, coders.RowCoder)\r\n\r\n# Create a PCollection with a NamedTuple type to assign a Schema\r\nmovies = p | 'create movies' >> beam.Map(some_function).with_output_types(Movie)\r\n\r\n# Retrieve the original type by accessing movies.element_type\r\n```\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK |

Added unit test for this change.\r\n3. Applied this new format to error reported from worker to Dataflow\r\nbackend.\r\nThe PR applies only to Dataflow runner, wouldn't change any existing\r\nlogs and log based features on Stackdriver and makes the error logged to\r\nDataflow backend consistently formatted between stream and batch pipelines.\r\nDetails see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7812.\r\nInternally integration tested in Google for Dataflow runner.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

this test takes 10 minutes, and unfortunately doesn't test what is intended.  The transformation under test is an extremely long-lived BoundedSource, not an unbounded source.\r\n\r\nI changed the transformation to an UnboundedSource, and  modified the MetricsResultMatchers to be able to apply any arbitrary Matcher to a metrics value.  This may be useful for BEAM-1169\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

fixes a regression of #8954 which led to Spotless only operating on a\r\nsubset of the Flink Runners source directories.\r\n\r\nThe previous generic solution (#8624) to use the SourceSets to configure\r\nSpotless in BeamModulePlugin is problematic because it does not work reliably.\r\n\r\nTo simplify and restore Spotless for the Flink Runner, we explicitly configure\r\nSpotless in the Flink Runner Gradle config.\r\n\r\nR: @adude3141 @akedin \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

Currently, `ReadFromDatastore` doesn't convert the properties of type key so the user has to deal with `google.cloud.datastore.key.Key` type instead of the expected `apache_beam.io.gcp.datastore.v1new.datastoreio.Key` type. This is also the case when trying to write a key property using `WriteToDatastore`.\r\n* `WriteToDatastore` and `DeleteFromDatastore` have an unused project ID argument. Like the previous version of the library, user expects the keys project attribute to be inferred from this parameter if unset.\r\n* When comparing keys, user expects the keys to be equal only if they are both in the same project.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the PubSub source implemented by DirectRunner uses [`Timestamp.from_rfc3339`](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/27bb5bc7b244809e7f6022adb2730d10204ce4d3/sdks/python/apache_beam/utils/timestamp.py#L98) to convert a PubSub attribute a timestamp. However,  `Timestamp.from_rfc3339` is limited in the types of `RFC-3339`-compliant timestamps that it can interpret. In particular, it fails to parse datetime strings that include a timezone, such as `2019-07-24T20:48:26+04:00`. Among other things, this prevents DirectRunner from correctly interpreting messages in the public `projects/pubsub-public-data/topics/taxirides-realtime` topic provided as part of the [NYC Taxi Tycoon Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-dataflow-nyc-taxi-tycoon).\r\n\r\nWhile the timestamp attribute can be assigned manually inside a custom `PTransform`, if the assigned timestamp is much older than the message publishing time, Dataflow will discard those messages as late.\r\n\r\nDataflow can correctly parse timestamps which include a timezone. In order to improve inter-compatibility, this functionality should also be added to DirectRunner.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a dependency on `python-dateutil`, which is a widely-used package providing functionality missing from Python's `datetime` module.\r\n\r\nRationale for tangential changes:\r\n- I had to change the order in which timestamp strings are interpreted as RFC 3339 and milliseconds to maintain backwards compatibility. Some strings, which are technically valid RFC 3339, make more sense as milliseconds. For example, `1337` used in the GCP integration test suite is a valid RFC 3339 string corresponding to `1337-01-01T00:00:00.0000Z`.\r\n\r\nCC: @ivant @ananvay \r\nR: @udim \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

pipelines that read from a PubSub topic and are executed using `BundleBasedDirectRunner` are never garbage collected because the [`_PubSubReadEvaluator._subscription_cache`](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/27bb5bc7b244809e7f6022adb2730d10204ce4d3/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/direct/transform_evaluator.py#L418) class attribute keeps references to all `ReadFromPubSub` transforms for the duration of the Python session. This is not ideal in the case of interactive pipeline prototyping and development, where the user may start and stop multiple pipelines from the same session\r\n\r\nThis PR makes two functional changes:\r\n- Change `_PubSubReadEvaluator._subscription_cache` to keep references to only those subscriptions that are created by `_PubSubReadEvaluator`. This means that Pipelines will be correctly garbage collected if the user supplies a subscription, rather than a topic, to `ReadFromPubSub`.\r\n- Use [`atexit.register`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/atexit.html#atexit.register) rather than [`__del__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__) to clean up subscriptions created by the `_PubSubReadEvaluator` class. According to the CPython documentation, \"it is not guaranteed that `__del__()` methods are called for objects that still exist when the interpreter exits\". Since the `_PubSubReadEvaluator._subscription_cache` class attribute will keep references to all created subscriptions until interpreter exists, it is not guaranteed that `__del__()` is called for any of those subscriptions. Using `atexit.register` is a better fit in this case. This partially (or fully?) addresses [BEAM-2988](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2988).\r\n\r\nCC: @ivant @ananvay \r\nR: @aaltay \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

replaced Perfkit's ability to setup/teardown kubernetes with a simple bash script. Thanks to this: \r\n\r\n - the tests will not be dependant on an external dependency (perfkit) and complexity is reduced\r\n - all logs are visible (perfkit used to hide some of them, eg from the gradle command)\r\n - we have more elasticity and can run multiple tests in sequence on the same k8s infrastructure\r\n - the bash script for kubernetes can be reused for local setup without jenkins\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
