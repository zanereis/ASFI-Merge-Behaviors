`null`.","created_at":"2023-01-19T02:00:12Z","updated_at":"2023-01-19T05:25:10Z","closed_at":"2023-01-19T05:25:06Z","merged_at":"2023-01-19T05:25:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"a75f110c0ea4234ff7144d18efff3d01bfe0c7d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13808/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13808/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13808/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/08d68a89bb4fe5036336baf175877911026206f1","head":{"label":"lightzhan-intellif:RemoveNoOp_Bug_Fix","ref":"RemoveNoOp_Bug_Fix","sha":"08d68a89bb4fe5036336baf175877911026206f1","user":{"login":"lightzhan-intellif","id":28034077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDM0MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28034077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif","html_url":"https://github.com/lightzhan-intellif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":554563921,"node_id":"R_kgDOIQ35UQ","name":"tvm","full_name":"lightzhan-intellif/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lightzhan-intellif","id":28034077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDM0MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28034077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif","html_url":"https://github.com/lightzhan-intellif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lightzhan-intellif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lightzhan-intellif/tvm","description":"Open

PR clarifies TVMScript is the only possible format for TIR printing\r\nby default. To do this, the PR makes the following changes:\r\n- `AsText` and `PrettyPrint` are moved to Relay, so that in code, it\r\n  stresses that they are specifically used for non-TIR usecases\r\n- The use of legacy behavior, for example, `TIRTextPrinterDebug`,\r\n  `PrettyPrint`, `AsText`, `AsLegacyRepr`, are still available in both\r\n  C++ and Python, but are discouraged in a way that one needs to include\r\n  extra headers.\r\n- `astext` method is removed from TIR nodes, but remain available for\r\n  Relay and

PR fixes a bug of IndexDataTypeNormalizer that is used by CreatePrimFunc.\r\n\r\n#13449 enhanced the normalizer by unwrapping unnecessary casts, by the rule that “if the value to be casted already has the target index dtype`, the cast will be omitted. However, there are cases where a cast here is for other purpose. Like in image resize operators, there are sometimes rounding operation for indices, like\r\n```python\r\n T.Cast(\"int64\", T.round(T.float32(128) / T.Cast(\"float32\", oh) * T.Cast(\"float32\", v_i2), dtype=\"float32\"))\r\n```\r\nis used as a final index. Note that this PrimExpr contains casts that directly operated on indices, such as `T.Cast(\"float32\", oh)`. This cast is for division purpose, in order to have floating point division result. As a result, it is not expected to unwrap such casts, while the previous implementation did remove the casts.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR patches this issue by only unwrapping the casts whose target dtype is integer dtype.\r\n\r\ncc @vinx13 @tqchen

PR fixes a bug of TIR Buffer `__getitem__` on Python side.\r\n\r\nWhenever the `__getitem__` parameter is a multi-dim slice, on non-slice dimension a Range will be created. Prior to this PR, that range will have int32 dtype in regardless of the `start`, while the proper behavior is to generate the extent according to the dtype of `start` when `start` is a

`key` in a target is used in dispatching to different strategies. \r\n\r\nIn most of the code base `arm_cpu` implies also having `cpu`. E.g. in `python/tvm/target/target.py`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef arm_cpu(...):\r\n    opts = [\"-keys=arm_cpu,cpu\", \"-device=arm_cpu\"] + pre_defined_opt\r\n    opts = _merge_opts(opts, options)\r\n    return Target(\" \".join([\"llvm\"] + opts))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn `src/target/parsers/mprofile.cc`: \r\n```\r\nstatic Array<String> MergeKeys(Optional<Array<String>> existing_keys) {\r\n  const Array<String> kExtraKeys = {\"arm_cpu\", \"cpu\"};\r\n\r\n  if (!existing_keys) {\r\n    return kExtraKeys;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  Array<String> keys = existing_keys.value();\r\n  for (String key : kExtraKeys) {\r\n    if (std::find(keys.begin(), keys.end(), key) == keys.end()) {\r\n      keys.push_back(key);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  return keys;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever A-series targets did not have both `arm_cpu` and `cpu` keys. Rather they only had `arm_cpu` keys. This PR makes it so it includes both, matching everywhere else in codebase. \r\n\r\nThis also may lead to increased performance speedups as previously A-series targets would dispatch to generic strategy instead of cpu optimized strategy. With this, they should properly dispatch to `arm_cpu` strategy, and fallback to `cpu` strategy.","created_at":"2023-01-12T18:53:24Z","updated_at":"2023-01-13T00:13:01Z","closed_at":"2023-01-13T00:12:56Z","merged_at":"2023-01-13T00:12:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"5878f6090b11dd20c124b322fd76c47a00bbb985","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13775/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13775/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13775/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/b69bd22628b2ccc610fec6cf3e84a316181d464a","head":{"label":"AndrewZhaoLuo:aluo/arm-cpu-is-cpu-targets","ref":"aluo/arm-cpu-is-cpu-targets","sha":"b69bd22628b2ccc610fec6cf3e84a316181d464a","user":{"login":"AndrewZhaoLuo","id":13855451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1NDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13855451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo","html_url":"https://github.com/AndrewZhaoLuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":350495744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTA0OTU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"AndrewZhaoLuo/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AndrewZhaoLuo","id":13855451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1NDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13855451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo","html_url":"https://github.com/AndrewZhaoLuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AndrewZhaoLuo/tvm","description":"Open

`crop_and_resize` operator uses floating-point arithmetic to determine whether an index is within a view-box.  This can cause the use of `extrapolation_value` to depend on target-dependent rounding differences.\r\n\r\nFor example, this issue was initially noticed on Vulkan during debugging of https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/13530, and was the result of computing `0.2*223.0 + 0.8*223.0 < 223.0`.  If all intermediates are cast to float32, the left-hand side evaluates to `223.00002`.  If intermediates are kept at a higher precision, the left-hand side evaluates to `223.0`.\r\n\r\nThe floating-point indexing can't be removed, because the operator must match the API defined by TensorFlow's operator implementation. The TensorFlow documentation for [`CropAndResize`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/class/tensorflow/ops/crop-and-resize) does not specify behavior in these cases, nor do the current TensorFlow unit tests check cases of rounding error.  Since the TensorFlow unit tests only use binary fractions for the `boxes` argument, which largely avoids the rounding issue, this commit updates the TVM unit tests to avoid depending on floating-point precision.","created_at":"2023-01-12T14:45:06Z","updated_at":"2023-04-05T19:16:42Z","closed_at":"2023-04-05T19:13:47Z","merged_at":"2023-04-05T19:13:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"6caf08589b169697eb8ed4a470044cc18bd3c44e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13773/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13773/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13773/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/aad6f0e43e2d1b1b9bf28c3688a3976870aff2ff","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:crop_and_resize_binary_fraction_box","ref":"crop_and_resize_binary_fraction_box","sha":"aad6f0e43e2d1b1b9bf28c3688a3976870aff2ff","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR makes a few improvements to `py_converter` to make it more useful for fuzz testing, especially when running larger modules.\r\n\r\nIn particular, these changes are to support returning the definition of a global var directly (e.g., if you do `run_as_python(main_var, mod=mod)`, the result will be a function corresponding to `mod[\"main\"]`) and to correct two bugs in the previous implementation:\r\n* Previously, it was not possible to insert a function into a runtime container object like an ADT. This was because the converter was simply compiling Relay functions into Python functions. This change solves this problem by registering the functions into `PackedFunc`s. However, another fix was also needed: Even though `PackedFunc` is an `ObjectRef` in C++, the Python bindings do not recognize `PackedFunc`s as `Object`s, so the code now calls the FFI API tuple constructor directly.\r\n* The implementation relied on `IRModule.from_expr` to wrap passed in expressions in a module. However, `from_expr` will not overwrite the `main` function if one is passed in via the `functions` argument. Thus, if the user passed in a module that already had a `main` function defined, the wrapping would be done incorrectly and result in the `main` being copied many times. This PR corrects this error by not assuming that the name `main` will be available and instead constructing a new module with a reserved name for the target.\r\n\r\nNone of the cases above had been tested before (there are now tests

#13242, I rewrote microTVM's convolution schedules to give a major improvement in performance. While I demonstrated in tests that my changes worked, they could not be used with `relay.build`.\r\n\r\nThis pull request expands the functionality of #13242 and adds new `legalize` and `alter_op` passes to take advantage of the quantized schedules. This dramatically improves performance on some models, dramatically cuts RAM usage, and removes the _need_ for autotuning on microTVM. More specifically, for the `vww` model from MLPerf Tiny running on the `nucleo_l4r5zi`, this pull request:\r\n\r\n- Improves **untuned** performance from `1741 ms` to `137 ms` - a **6.8x** improvement!\r\n- Improves **tuned** performance from `337 ms` to `137 ms`.\r\n- Sets a new state-of-the-art for MLPerf Tiny, [beating Plumerai's previous 208 ms record](https://blog.plumerai.com/)\r\n- Reduces RAM consumption by **73 KB** (a large amount on microcontrollers!) by eliminating intermediate buffers.\r\n- Reduces flash consumption for model weights by **5x**\r\n- Slightly improves accuracy\r\n\r\n@mehrdadh has kindly tested these changes himself, and has confirmed my `137 ms` figure.\r\n \r\nTo enable the schedules that grant these performance improvements, this pull request:\r\n- Adds `out_layout` support to the regular and depthwise conv2d schedules from #13242.\r\n- Generalizes the schedules from #13242 to be more widely applicable.\r\n- Adds a layout alternation pass to ensure regular and depthwise conv2d schedules always get their desired input formats.\r\n- Adds a `conv2d -> depthwise conv2d -> unpadded conv2d` rewrite step to remove empty channels from `conv2d` operators.\r\n- Adds a `conv2d -> average pool -> dense` rewrite step to remove empty channels from `conv2d` operators.\r\n- Adds an `alter_op` pass to fold padding into a separate Relay operator.","created_at":"2023-01-10T21:43:04Z","updated_at":"2023-03-02T23:58:17Z","closed_at":"2023-03-02T23:58:16Z","merged_at":"2023-03-02T23:58:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"a42e98b1956f867dc0a2527b734612012f3cce27","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13752/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13752/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13752/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/698f6e1fabebf9578b278201c9c22910a5642351","head":{"label":"guberti:micro/full-qnn-support","ref":"micro/full-qnn-support","sha":"698f6e1fabebf9578b278201c9c22910a5642351","user":{"login":"guberti","id":3069006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjkwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3069006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti","html_url":"https://github.com/guberti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":371518634,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzE1MTg2MzQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"guberti/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guberti","id":3069006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjkwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3069006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti","html_url":"https://github.com/guberti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guberti/tvm","description":"Open

from https://github.com/tlc-pack/relax/pull/335. The original author is @TrellixVulnTeam from the Advanced Research Center at [Trellix](https://www.trellix.com). \r\n\r\nThis PR patches the security vulnerability CVE-2007-4559 in the Arduino and Zephyr Project API servers. CVE-2007-4559 is a 15 year old bug in the Python tarfile package. By using extract() or extractall() on a tarfile object without sanitizing input, a maliciously crafted .tar  Model Library Format file could perform a directory path traversal attack, silently overwriting files outside the target project target dir when creating new projects, for instance. The patch essentially checks to see if all tarfile members will be extracted safely and throws an exception otherwise. Further technical information about the vulnerability can be found in this [blog](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/tarfile-exploiting-the-world.html).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: TrellixVulnTeam

this is a patch to handle EqNode in `detect_clip_bound`. We got some regression failure when using this methodology as the power of upstream arithmetic simplifier grows.\r\n\r\nMany trivial cases like `x >= 4, x in [0, 4]` seems to get well simplified to `x==4`  and certain assumptions on some condition be non-eq comparation do not hold

PR makes changed to update ci_cortexm to 20.04. Here is a list of changes:\r\n- Updates nrfjprog to latest (10.18.1) to fix issues related to running microTVM tests inside docker. The main issue was that with older version commands like nrfjprog --com was not working even with docker --privileged.\r\n- Update python install script to support python 3.7 in 20.04 -> we keep using python 3.7 in ubuntu 20.04 until its EOL\r\n- Add script to install LLVM in ubuntu 20.04\r\n\r\ncc @driazati

Motivation\r\nCurrently, our default profiler (`time_evaluator`) does not flush the L2 cache per execution, this might lead to incorrect time measurement because the input data last run might reside in L2 cache and reduce the data fetching time in the next run. Both [Triton](https://github.com/openai/triton/blob/ff399fbc2059a6f35cb93534dc29398f7b82dbc7/python/triton/testing.py#L156-L181) and [nvbench](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvbench/blob/1a13a2e724b8aa8aee27649ac6878babb63862a6/nvbench/detail/measure_cold.cuh#L123) consider this effect thus reporting more accurate measurements.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n`time_evalutor` has an argument `f_preproc` where user can specify a pre-processing function per execution of the kernel being evaluated. Currently, TVM supports `cache_flush_cpu_non_first_arg` which flushes CPU cache. But similar functionality for GPU is missing.\r\n\r\nThis PR completely borrows the design of nvbench's [l2flush](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvbench/blob/1a13a2e724b8aa8aee27649ac6878babb63862a6/nvbench/detail/l2flush.cuh) struct and allow the user to specify `\"l2_cache_flush_cuda\"` as a preprocessing function which flushes NVIDIA GPU's L2 cache. `l2_cache_flush_cuda` is not a default value so existing program's behavior would not be influenced.\r\n\r\n<del>\r\nNote that this PR also changes the location where `f_preproc` being triggered: previously `f_preproc` is triggered per repeat but that doesn't sound correct to me because most users specify `repeat=1` and `f_preproc` need to be triggered once per run.</del>\r\n\r\ncc @masahi @tkonolige @junrushao @spectrometerHBH @tqchen

numerators to modulo/remainder operations are not supported by the Vulkan API.  While the SPIR-V instructions\r\n[`OpSRem`](https://registry.khronos.org/SPIR-V/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html#OpSRem) and [`OpSMod`](https://registry.khronos.org/SPIR-V/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html#OpSMod) have identical semantics to `tir::Mod` and `tir::FloorMod`, respectively, use of either instruction within Vulkan results in undefined behavior.  From the [Vulkan spec](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3/html/chap37.html#spirvenv-op-prec):\r\n\r\n> For the OpSRem and OpSMod instructions, if either operand is negative the result is undefined.\r\n>\r\n> Note: While the OpSRem and OpSMod instructions are supported by the Vulkan environment, they require non-negative values and thus do not enable additional functionality beyond what OpUMod provides.\r\n\r\nThis issue was first noticed in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/13530, where use of integer arithmetic resulted in negative numerators.  This hadn't caused issues previously, because most use of div/mod use a denominator that is a power of two.  In these cases, `tir.LowerIntrin` implements floordiv and floormod using only bitwise operations.  When the denominator isn't a power of two, both `tir::FloorDiv` and `tir::FloorMod` are implemented in terms of `tir::Mod`, which triggers the undefined behavior for negative numerators.\r\n\r\nThis commit alters the lowering of FloorDiv/FloorMod to TruncDiv/TruncMod, in cases where the denominator is positive, the numerator is sometimes negative, and the range of the numerator is known.  In these cases, the FloorDiv/FloorMod is now implemented by offsetting the numerator such that it is always positive.","created_at":"2023-01-07T04:03:33Z","updated_at":"2023-05-09T20:55:37Z","closed_at":"2023-01-10T17:47:49Z","merged_at":"2023-01-10T17:47:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"68c917d9b46ea622131cbda690dd676368b068e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13724/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13724/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13724/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c392b3e7dcb6f46c0a7b23a33766378b012e9f4d","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:offset_negative_floormod_floordiv","ref":"offset_negative_floormod_floordiv","sha":"c392b3e7dcb6f46c0a7b23a33766378b012e9f4d","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

numerators to modulo/remainder operations are not supported by the Vulkan API.  While the SPIR-V instructions\r\n[`OpSRem`](https://registry.khronos.org/SPIR-V/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html#OpSRem) and [`OpSMod`](https://registry.khronos.org/SPIR-V/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html#OpSMod) have identical semantics to `tir::Mod` and `tir::FloorMod`, respectively, use of either instruction within Vulkan results in undefined behavior.  From the [Vulkan spec](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3/html/chap37.html#spirvenv-op-prec):\r\n\r\n> For the OpSRem and OpSMod instructions, if either operand is negative the result is undefined.\r\n>\r\n> Note: While the OpSRem and OpSMod instructions are supported by the Vulkan environment, they require non-negative values and thus do not enable additional functionality beyond what OpUMod provides.\r\n\r\nThis issue was first noticed in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/13530, where use of integer arithmetic resulted in negative numerators.  This hadn't caused issues previously, because most use of div/mod use a denominator that is a power of two.  In these cases, `tir.LowerIntrin` implements floordiv and floormod using only bitwise operations.  When the denominator isn't a power of two, both `tir::FloorDiv` and `tir::FloorMod` are implemented in terms of `tir::Mod`, which triggers the undefined behavior for negative numerators.\r\n\r\nThis commit implements additional simplification rules that preferentially removes negative values from the numerators.  For example, simplifying `floormod(i - 2, 8)` to `floormod(i + 6, 8)`, and simplifying `floordiv(i - 2, 8)` to `floordiv(i + 6, 8) - 1`.  These handle the most common case, where some index variable is being offset by a negative
