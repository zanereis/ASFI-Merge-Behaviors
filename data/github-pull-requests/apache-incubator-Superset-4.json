href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases\"><code>@​reduxjs/toolkit</code>'s releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v2.5.0</h2>\n<p>This <strong>feature release</strong> updates the React peer dependency to work with React 19, and fixes an additional skip token issue.</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<h3>React 19 Compat</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19\">React 19 was just released</a>! We've updated our peer dep to accept React 19, and updated our runtime and type tests to check against both React 18 and 19.</p>\n<p>Also see <a href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v9.2.0\">React-Redux v9.2.0</a> for the same peer dep update.</p>\n<h3>Other Fixes</h3>\n<p>We previously fixed an issue with the RTKQ core where <code>serializeQueryArgs</code> callbacks could be called with <code>skipToken</code>, potentially leading to errors.

It now always checks both effect + type.</p>\n<h3>Additional TS Types</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

<code>action</code>/<code>loader</code> function returns <code>undefined</code> as revalidations need to know whether the loader has previously been executed. <code>undefined</code> also causes issues during SSR stringification for hydration. You should always ensure your <code>loader</code>/<code>action</code> returns a value, and you may return <code>null</code> if you don't wish to return anything. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9511\">#9511</a>)</li>\n<li>Properly handle redirects to external domains (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9590\">#9590</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9654\">#9654</a>)</li>\n<li>Preserve the HTTP method on 307/308 redirects (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9597\">#9597</a>)</li>\n<li>Support <code>basename</code> in static data routers (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9591\">#9591</a>)</li>\n<li>Enhanced <code>ErrorResponse</code> bodies to contain more descriptive text in internal 403/404/405 scenarios</li>\n<li>Fix issues with encoded characters in <code>NavLink</code> and descendant <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9589\">#9589</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9647\">#9647</a>)</li>\n<li>Properly serialize/deserialize <code>ErrorResponse</code> instances when using built-in hydration (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9593\">#9593</a>)</li>\n<li>Support <code>basename</code> in static data routers (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9591\">#9591</a>)</li>\n<li>Updated dependencies:\n<ul>\n<li><code>@remix-run/router@1.0.4</code></li>\n<li><code>react-router@6.4.4</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router-dom@6.4.3...react-router-dom@6.4.4\">https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router-dom@6.4.3...react-router-dom@6.4.4</a></p>\n<h2>react-router-dom@6.4.0-pre.15</h2>\n<h3>Patch Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>fix: remove internal router singleton (<a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/HEAD/packages/react-router-dom/issues/9227\">#9227</a>)</p>\n<p>This change removes the internal module-level <code>routerSingleton</code> we create and maintain inside our data routers since it was causing a number of headaches for non-simple use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unit tests are a pain because you need to find a way to reset the singleton in-between tests\n<ul>\n<li>Use use a <code>_resetModuleScope</code> singleton for our tests</li>\n<li>...but this isn't exposed to users who may want to do their own tests around our router</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The JSX children <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> objects cause non-intuitive behavior based on idiomatic react expectations\n<ul>\n<li>Conditional runtime <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>'s won't get picked up</li>\n<li>Adding new <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>'s during local dev won't get picked up during HMR</li>\n<li>Using external state in your elements doesn't work as one might expect (see <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/HEAD/packages/react-router-dom/issues/9225\">#9225</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead, we are going to lift the singleton out into user-land, so that they create the router singleton and manage it outside the react tree - which is what react 18 is encouraging with <code>useSyncExternalStore</code> anyways! This also means that since users create the router - there's no longer any difference in the rendering aspect for memory/browser/hash routers (which only impacts router/history creation) - so we can get rid of those and trim to a simple <code>RouterProvider</code></p>\n<pre lang=\"jsx\"><code>// Before\nfunction App() {\n  &lt;DataBrowserRouter&gt;\n    &lt;Route path=&quot;/&quot; element={&lt;Layout /&gt;}&gt;\n      &lt;Route index element={&lt;Home /&gt;}&gt;\n    &lt;/Route&gt;\n  &lt;DataBrowserRouter&gt;\n}\n<p>// After<br />\nlet router = createBrowserRouter([{<br />\npath: &quot;/&quot;,<br />\nelement: &lt;Layout /&gt;,<br />\nchildren: [{<br />\nindex: true,<br />\n</code></pre></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

breaking changes. Read <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19\">React 19 release post</a> and <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide\">React 19 upgrade guide</a> for more information.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: To help make the upgrade to React 19 easier, we’ve published a react@18.3 release that is identical to 18.2 but adds warnings for deprecated APIs and other changes that are needed for React 19. We recommend upgrading to React 18.3.1 first to help identify any issues before upgrading to React 19.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<h3>React</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Actions: <code>startTransition</code> can now accept async functions. Functions passed to <code>startTransition</code> are called “Actions”. A given Transition can include one or more Actions which update state in the background and update the UI with one commit. In addition to updating state, Actions can now perform side effects including async requests, and the Action will wait for the work to finish before finishing the Transition. This feature allows Transitions to include side effects like <code>fetch()</code> in the pending state, and provides support for error handling, and optimistic updates.</li>\n<li><code>useActionState</code>: is a new hook to order Actions inside of a Transition with access to the state of the action, and the pending state. It accepts a reducer that can call Actions, and the initial state used for first render. It also accepts an optional string that is used if the action is passed to a form <code>action</code> prop to support progressive enhancement in forms.</li>\n<li><code>useOptimistic</code>: is a new hook to update state while a Transition is in progress. It returns the state, and a set function that can be called inside a transition to “optimistically” update the state to expected final value immediately while the Transition completes in the background. When the transition finishes, the state is updated to the new value.</li>\n<li><code>use</code>: is a new API that allows reading resources in render. In React 19, <code>use</code> accepts a promise or Context. If provided a promise, <code>use</code> will suspend until a value is resolved. <code>use</code> can only be used in render but can be called conditionally.</li>\n<li><code>ref</code> as a prop: Refs can now be used as props, removing the need for <code>forwardRef</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Suspense sibling pre-warming</strong>: When a component suspends, React will immediately commit the fallback of the nearest Suspense boundary, without waiting for the entire sibling tree to render. After the fallback commits, React will schedule another render for the suspended siblings to “pre-warm” lazy requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React DOM Client</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> prop: Form Actions allow you to manage forms automatically and integrate with <code>useFormStatus</code>. When a <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> succeeds, React will automatically reset the form for uncontrolled components. The form can be reset manually with the new <code>requestFormReset</code> API.</li>\n<li><code>&lt;button&gt; and &lt;input&gt; formAction</code> prop: Actions can be passed to the <code>formAction</code> prop to configure form submission behavior. This allows using different Actions depending on the input.</li>\n<li><code>useFormStatus</code>: is a new hook that provides the status of the parent <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code>, as if the form was a Context provider. The hook returns the values: <code>pending</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>method</code>, and <code>action</code>.</li>\n<li>Support for Document Metadata: We’ve added support for rendering document metadata tags in components natively. React will automatically hoist them into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the document.</li>\n<li>Support for Stylesheets: React 19 will ensure stylesheets are inserted into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> on the client before revealing the content of a Suspense boundary that depends on that stylesheet.</li>\n<li>Support for async scripts: Async scripts can be rendered anywhere in the component tree and React will handle ordering and deduplication.</li>\n<li>Support for preloading resources: React 19 ships with <code>preinit</code>, <code>preload</code>, <code>prefetchDNS</code>, and <code>preconnect</code> APIs to optimize initial page loads by moving discovery of additional resources like fonts out of stylesheet loading. They can also be used to prefetch resources used by an anticipated navigation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React DOM Server</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>prerender</code> and <code>prerenderToNodeStream</code> APIs for static site generation. They are designed to work with streaming environments like Node.js Streams and Web Streams. Unlike <code>renderToString</code>, they wait for data to load for HTML generation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React Server Components</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>RSC features such as directives, server components, and server functions are now stable. This means libraries that ship with Server Components can now target React 19 as a peer dependency with a react-server export condition for use in frameworks that support the Full-stack React Architecture. The underlying APIs used to implement a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x. See <a href=\"https://19.react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components\">docs</a> for how to support React Server Components.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Deprecated: <code>element.ref</code> access: React 19 supports ref as a prop, so we’re deprecating <code>element.ref</code> in favor of <code>element.props.ref</code>. Accessing will result in a warning.</li>\n<li><code>react-test-renderer</code>: In React 19, react-test-renderer logs a deprecation warning and has switched to concurrent rendering for web usage. We recommend migrating your tests to  <a href=\"https://github.com/testinglibrary\"><code>@​testinglibrary</code></a>.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) or <a href=\"https://github.com/testingesting-library\"><code>@​testingesting-library</code></a>.com/docs/react-native-testing-library/intro)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<p>React 19 brings in a number of breaking changes, including the removals of long-deprecated APIs. We recommend first upgrading to <code>18.3.1</code>, where we've added additional deprecation warnings. Check out the <a href=\"https://19.react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide\">upgrade guide</a> for more details and guidance on codemodding.</p>\n<h3>React</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>New JSX Transform is now required: We introduced <a href=\"https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html\">a new JSX transform</a> in 2020 to improve bundle size and use JSX without importing React. In React 19, we’re adding additional improvements like using ref as a prop and JSX speed improvements that require the new transform.</li>\n<li>Errors in render are not re-thrown: Errors that are not caught by an Error Boundary are now reported to window.reportError. Errors that are caught by an Error Boundary are reported to console.error. We’ve introduced <code>onUncaughtError</code> and <code>onCaughtError</code> methods to <code>createRoot</code> and <code>hydrateRoot</code> to customize this error handling.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>propTypes</code>: Using <code>propTypes</code> will now be silently ignored. If required, we recommend migrating to TypeScript or another type-checking solution.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>defaultProps</code> for functions: ES6 default parameters can be used in place. Class components continue to support <code>defaultProps</code> since there is no ES6 alternative.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>contextTypes</code> and <code>getChildContext</code>: Legacy Context for class components has been removed in favor of the <code>contextType</code> API.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

If provided a promise, <code>use</code> will suspend until a value is resolved. <code>use</code> can only be used in render but can be called conditionally.</li>\n<li><code>ref</code> as a prop: Refs can now be used as props, removing the need for <code>forwardRef</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Suspense sibling pre-warming</strong>: When a component suspends, React will immediately commit the fallback of the nearest Suspense boundary, without waiting for the entire sibling tree to render. After the fallback commits, React will schedule another render for the suspended siblings to “pre-warm” lazy requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>React DOM Client</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> prop: Form Actions allow you to manage forms automatically and integrate with <code>useFormStatus</code>. When a <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> succeeds, React will automatically reset the form for uncontrolled components. The form can be reset manually with the new <code>requestFormReset</code> API.</li>\n<li><code>&lt;button&gt; and &lt;input&gt; formAction</code> prop: Actions can be passed to the <code>formAction</code> prop to configure form submission behavior. This allows using different Actions depending on the input.</li>\n<li><code>useFormStatus</code>: is a new hook that provides the status of the parent <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code>, as if the form was a Context provider. The hook returns the values: <code>pending</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>method</code>, and <code>action</code>.</li>\n<li>Support for Document Metadata: We’ve added support for rendering document metadata tags in components natively. React will automatically hoist them into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the document.</li>\n<li>Support for Stylesheets: React 19 will ensure stylesheets are inserted into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> on the client before revealing the content of a Suspense boundary that depends on that stylesheet.</li>\n<li>Support for async scripts: Async scripts can be rendered anywhere in the component tree and React will handle ordering and deduplication.</li>\n<li>Support for preloading resources: React 19 ships with <code>preinit</code>, <code>preload</code>, <code>prefetchDNS</code>, and <code>preconnect</code> APIs to optimize initial page loads by moving discovery of additional resources like fonts out of stylesheet loading. They can also be used to prefetch resources used by an anticipated navigation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>React DOM Server</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>prerender</code> and <code>prerenderToNodeStream</code> APIs for static site generation. They are designed to work with streaming environments like Node.js Streams and Web Streams. Unlike <code>renderToString</code>, they wait for data to load for HTML generation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>React Server Components</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>RSC features such as directives, server components, and server functions are now stable. This means libraries that ship with Server Components can now target React 19 as a peer dependency with a react-server export condition for use in frameworks that support the Full-stack React Architecture. The underlying APIs used to implement a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x. See <a href=\"https://19.react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components\">docs</a> for how to support React Server Components.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Deprecations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Deprecated: <code>element.ref</code> access: React 19 supports ref as a prop, so we’re deprecating <code>element.ref</code> in favor of <code>element.props.ref</code>. Accessing will result in a warning.</li>\n<li><code>react-test-renderer</code>: In React 19, react-test-renderer logs a deprecation warning and has switched to concurrent rendering for web usage. We recommend migrating your tests to  <a href=\"https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/\"><code>@​testing-library/react</code></a> or <a href=\"https://testing-library.com/docs/react-native-testing-library/intro\"><code>@​testing-library/react-native</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>React 19 brings in a number of breaking changes, including the removals of long-deprecated APIs. We recommend first upgrading to <code>18.3.1</code>, where we've added additional deprecation warnings. Check out the <a href=\"https://19.react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide\">upgrade guide</a> for more details and guidance on codemodding.</p>\n<h3>React</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>New JSX Transform is now required: We introduced <a href=\"https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html\">a new JSX transform</a> in 2020 to improve bundle size and use JSX without importing React. In React 19, we’re adding additional improvements like using ref as a prop and JSX speed improvements that require the new transform.</li>\n<li>Errors in render are not re-thrown: Errors that are not caught by an Error Boundary are now reported to window.reportError. Errors that are caught by an Error Boundary are reported to console.error. We’ve introduced <code>onUncaughtError</code> and <code>onCaughtError</code> methods to <code>createRoot</code> and <code>hydrateRoot</code> to customize this error handling.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>propTypes</code>: Using <code>propTypes</code> will now be silently ignored. If required, we recommend migrating to TypeScript or another type-checking solution.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>defaultProps</code> for functions: ES6 default parameters can be used in place. Class components continue to support <code>defaultProps</code> since there is no ES6 alternative.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[https://github.com/apache/superset/security/code-scanning/1203](https://github.com/apache/superset/security/code-scanning/1203)\n\nTo fix the problem, we need to replace the use of the MD5 hashing algorithm with a stronger cryptographic hash function. In this case, SHA-256 is a suitable replacement as it is a strong and widely accepted cryptographic hash function.\n\n- Replace the `hashlib.md5` function with `hashlib.sha256` in the `md5_sha_from_str` function.\n- Ensure that the rest of the code that relies on this function continues to work as expected with the new hash function.\n\n\n_Suggested fixes powered by Copilot Autofix. Review carefully before merging._\n","created_at":"2024-12-18T22:46:09Z","updated_at":"2025-01-07T15:19:23Z","closed_at":"2025-01-07T15:19:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329183122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MTgzMTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XS","name":"size/XS","color":"E2D8FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2630106047,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjMwMTA2MDQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/preset-io","name":"preset-io","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":6757605397,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABksjgFQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/review:draft","name":"review:draft","color":"FF5A5F","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/31514/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/31514/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/31514/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/statuses/4f96b4c2dc595406083019c30b41fa50e548f4d1","head":{"label":"apache:alert-autofix-1203","ref":"alert-autofix-1203","sha":"4f96b4c2dc595406083019c30b41fa50e548f4d1","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39464018,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTQ2NDAxOA==","name":"superset","full_name":"apache/superset","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset","description":"Apache

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWe have a function called `apply_post_process` that replicates the post-processing done in Javascript by different visualization types. This is needed for reports; for example, when sending a pivot table as a text we need to replicate the pivoting logic in Python, so that the report matches what the visualization shows.\r\n\r\nThe name is somewhat confusing, since we already have the concept of post-processing in visualizations. To make the difference more evident I renamed the method to `apply_client_processing`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

python to 3.11 as the default version, supporting 3.10, and deprecating 3.9 support\r\n\r\nCurrently in this PR I'm setting `next` to `3.11` and `current` to `3.11.11`. This means when 3.11.12 shows up CI will run on two different versions within 3.11. Eventually we can make `next` point to 3.12 as lib support grows.\r\n\r\n# about 3.12\r\n\r\nSeems 3.12 is not easy at the moment, hit some issues that pointed to upgrading dependencies, but hit some conflicting diamond dependencies as I was doing so. https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/31313 would help sort this out at a faster pace, without the bugs and slowness of

SUMMARY\r\nAfter analyzing the source code, a variable is set to `true` by default in the Table chart (`superset/superset-frontend/plugins/plugin-chart-table/src/TableChart.tsx`) but not in the Pivot Table (`superset/superset-frontend/plugins/plugin-chart-pivot-table/src/PivotTableChart.tsx`). The variable in question is `allowRenderHtml` in the function `export default function TableChart<D extends DataRecord = DataRecord>` or `export default function PivotTableChart(props: PivotTableProps)`.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to make this value configurable via a feature flag. Therefore, a new feature flag needs to be declared in the file `superset/superset-frontend/packages/superset-ui-core/src/utils/featureFlags.ts` as follows:\r\n`AllowPivotTableHtml = 'ALLOW_PIVOT_TABLE_HTML'`.\r\n\r\nThen, retrieve this feature flag in the source code of the Pivot Table like this:\r\n`allowRenderHtml = isFeatureEnabled(FeatureFlag.AllowPivotTableHtml)`\r\n\r\nFinally, declare the new feature flag in the superset_config.py file and set it to true as follows:\r\n```\r\nFEATURE_FLAGS = {\r\n    \"ALLOW_PIVOT_TABLE_HTML\": True,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n![Capture d'écran 17 12 2024 à 15 03 50

superset_config.py and look if your html is formated or not in the Pivot Table.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [x] Required feature flags: ALLOW_PIVOT_TABLE_HTML\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nIn a perfect world database optimizers would know how to push predicates into inner queries, but in reality many databases don't do that. This can be a huge performance issue for charts built on top of virtual datasets, where the SQL is wrapped by the controls from the chart builder.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new feature flag `OPTIMIZE_SQL`. When the feature is on, and the database engine has a supported dialect in `sqlglot`, SQL queries on virtual datasets will be optimized automatically, pushing the predicates into the inner `SELECT` is possible.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nAfter upgrading the Tooltip component to antd5, tooltips were covering the date selector in horizontal native filters bar and preventing clicking on the filter.\r\nThis PR fixes it by removing `getPopupContainer` prop from Tooltip, which was introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24617 to fix an issue with tooltip position when user scrolls the page.\r\nApparently Antd v5 fixed this behaviour and we no longer need to pass `getPopupContainer`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7b21916-3ee3-427e-abc4-46b59ec40629\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a2b734f-4c5d-4156-b558-027c4506b879\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Add a date native filter\r\n2. Set a date\r\n3. Verify that the tooltip is not covering the filter control and that its placement doesn't change when you scroll\r\n4. Make sure that it works as expected both in horizontal and vertical filter bar\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

SUMMARY\r\nEven though `.env-non-dev` (not to be confused with `.env-local`) is mentioned in `docker/README.md`, it's not mentioned or used anywhere else in the repo, except it's being excluded from the `linkinator` job inside [`superset-docs-verify.yml`](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/.github/workflows/superset-docs-verify.yml#L31).\r\n\r\nThe sentence \"`docker-compose-non-dev.yml` uses `.env-non-dev` which sets the variable `SUPERSET_ENV` to `production`\" is misleading because `docker-compose-non-dev.yml` **doesn't** use `.env-non-dev` and `.env-non-dev` **doesn't** set env var to anything because `.env-non-dev` **doesn't even exist**.\r\n\r\nSo I went ahead and removed it.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. clone repo\r\n2. run `cd superset; grep -rin env-non-dev`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe new Add Filter/Divider buttons were getting hidden when the browser window was too short. \"But it's flexbox, that shouldn't happen\" I said. Then I started looking at all the onion layers of styled divs with random heights and overrides. \r\n\r\nThis PR cleans a bunch of junk up. There are fewer elements now, a few unnecessary overrides and styles are taken out, and things generally use more flexbox-native layouts. I could keep trimming until the cows come home, but I wanted to stop when the problem was fixed.  \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nVideo demo with narration:\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ebaab79-71bc-40e5-975e-d09b77bf75e6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

a bunch of `ruff` rules trying to match what we had in `pylint` before. I believe some of those were only enforced in `superset/`, not in `tests/` by our `pylint` config, now going global on them \r\n\r\nRan the `ruff check --fix` but decided against running unsafe fixes. Also ran `ruff check --add-noqa` which is a god send, allowing us to start enforcing new rules, and auto-tagging lines with the right noqa assignements.\r\n\r\nAs a follow up, we may want to give `ruff check --usafe-fixes --ignore-noqa` a spin to see try to correct older things marked with noqa as part of this PR, but didn't want to break things as part of this PR\r\n\r\nNote that I took on a lot more rules here, potentially ones that were not enforced by `pylint` in the past. We can always relax and fine tune rules we don't like moving forward.\r\n\r\n@sadpandajoe sorry for touching 379 files as a result, and hoping it doesn't lead to merge conflicts. As you get these types of conflicts, you can easily use `--theirs` (assuming they conflict with lint-related edits here) and run `ruff check --fix && ruff check --add-no-qa` afterwards as a quick-ish way to resolve these types conflicts.","created_at":"2024-12-13T21:14:14Z","updated_at":"2024-12-19T01:41:38Z","closed_at":"2024-12-19T01:41:34Z","merged_at":"2024-12-19T01:41:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"e51b95ffa8377470ee5495a37ff5ec03b4de1aff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"michael-s-molina","id":70410625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDEwNjI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70410625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina","html_url":"https://github.com/michael-s-molina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"giftig","id":2862039,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjIwMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2862039?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig","html_url":"https://github.com/giftig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1127990345,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTI3OTkwMzQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/risk:db-migration","name":"risk:db-migration","color":"e67e22","default":false,"description":"PRs

SUMMARY\r\nAs part of the DB import logic, Superset creates all permissions for the connection (`database access on ...`, `catalog access on ...`, `schema access on ...`, etc). It's possible that the credentials used for the connection has access to list all catalogs, but can't get the schemas for every catalog (this is reproducible if you create an AWS RDS PSQL - the master account will list the `rdsadmin` DB but can't list its schemas).\r\n\r\nThere was already logic in place to gracefully handle this scenario in the DB creation method. This PR implements the following changes:\r\n1. Moves the `add_permissions` helper that was being used in `superset/commands/database/importers/v1/utils.py` to `superset/commands/database/utils.py` (since now it's used both by import and create commands).\r\n2. Includes the `try/except` logic that was already present in the create command to the `add_permissions` helper. \r\n3. Update both commands to use this helper, so that it's DRYer. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo UI changes. Import should work without errors.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nUnit test added. For manual testing:\r\n\r\n1. Connect to an AWS RDS PSQL DB.\r\n2. Export the connection.\r\n3. Validate that importing it works.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n-

SUMMARY\r\nWhile working on tags I noticed that the bulk create API spec had multiple issues. This cleans up most of the issues I noticed. The OAS3 schema is also regenerated by running `superset update-api-docs`. However, the whole `tags` resource is pretty funky (including the data model and the related enums), so I would almost suggest doing a big refactor on it at some point.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nThe description, request type, and the 200 response are wrong:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47348e6a-485b-4ae0-b185-f81d94b27333)\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow they are in line with what the method actually expects/returns.

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nProblem\r\nIf the subject remains the same, all scheduled reports will be delivered in the same email thread, requiring the recipient to scroll back to the original thread to find the latest email.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a date is included in the email subject, the emails will not be grouped in the same thread. To address this, I propose adding a feature that allows users to specify a date format in the email subject, enabling the email client to correctly thread the emails and display them in a more organized manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n<img width=\"1005\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 11 57 06 am\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e92d106f-13ed-48a7-86dc-3b4241712391\" />\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n<img width=\"1189\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 11 57 30 am\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d250bed0-dcc8-403f-8eae-34a7190e3e1e\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1182\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 12 01 34 pm\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/138ca1ce-aff7-4317-9083-fe8cf2b3eb1c\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to use it\r\n\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n\r\nSet the `DATE_FORMAT_IN_EMAIL_SUBJECT=True` to allow users to include a date format in the email subject, which will

time looking at every single step of the `docker` / `docker compose` build process, using `dive` and `docker stats` to inspect every layer/stage/builds. Found a lot of things to improve in and out of docker.\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n- after building the container, we now fire up `docker-compose up superset-init` to make sure we can actually run the container and perform init-related operations (loading examples, ...), this will catch issues we didn't catch before, whether it's related to the container, docker-compose or the app itself\r\n- during GHA builds, pass ARGs to docker command to NOT include a headless browser, keeping image sizes smaller, builds faster at least in the context of GHA and dev env.\r\n- install the latest docker compose plugin (our docker-compose files require a newer version than what's in the default ubuntu repos)\r\n- print some docker stats after the GHA build, namely `docker images $IMAGEID` `docker history $IMAGEID`, so it's easy to look at stage sizes in the GHA logs, makes it easier to introspect what's happening, even compare different branches/sha more easily just by looking at logs\r\n- docs: documenting new ENV var flags in our docker-compose docs, making things more discoverable/configurable\r\n- calling `uv pip` instead of plain `pip` in more (all?) places, speeding things up\r\n- on PR push, running a matrix of both `lean` and `dev` (instead of just `dev`) and make sure that they both complete. Added something to make sure postgres driver is installed at load (`up`) time\r\n- removing `playwright` from `dev` requirements as it's pretty heavy and don't need it for most development use cases, keeping builds faster/leaner\r\n- found things to add to `.dockerignore` that were bloating the image\r\n- mounting some cache directories when using npm/webpack (preventing 3-4GB of cache to make it inside the frontend build stage), this should greatly improve memory usage while building the frontend\r\n- removed .map files from output when running `npm run build`, slashing the size of the static

https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/31357 and https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/31360\r\n\r\nAlso other docker-related improvements:\r\n- fixes ephemeral envs\r\n- perms: `superset` user has now less access in-docker, can basically run the few scripts is needs as entrypoints and has readonly access to the app itself. This is good as if the app is compromised, the attacker can't change the app itself to exploit further security issues \r\n- uses `uv` and its venv now\r\n- simplify the headless browser section, should make image smaller if no browser are installed\r\n- python app gets \"compiled\" with pyc files created upfront for a faster startup time\r\n- refactor how translations are compiled, using isolated stages for backend/frontend
