Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1018\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAirflow was using serveral logging formats which were difficult to\r\nparse. The patch makes sure we always log PID.\r\n\r\nAlso the scheduler did not allow for stdout/stderr output for its\r\nparsing of dags, this was a regression. Until we fix logging\r\nproperly - by not creating arbitrary files in arbitrary modules,\r\nthis is a workaround to allow logging to stdout/stderr.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- Cannot add tests to cover stdout in a sane way\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1004\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n\r\nAIRFLOW-276 introduced a monitor process for gunicorn\r\nto find new files in the dag folder, but it also changed\r\n`airflow webserver -D`'s behavior to run in foreground.\r\nThis PR fixes that by running the monitor as a daemon process.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n\r\ntests.core:CliTests.test_cli_webserver_foreground\r\ntests.core:CliTests.test_cli_webserver_background\r\n\r\nThe latter fails on Travis due to lack of file permission, so I ran it locally and succeeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-01T14:31:03Z","updated_at":"2017-04-18T21:45:00Z","closed_at":"2017-04-04T06:33:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"51ec4912502d48774a8c57fd7e4bf6ac14f68122","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2208/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2208/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2208/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/3fb2e991ee7d5c4df2ac3eab5c58f62de9c8caa3","head":{"label":"sekikn:AIRFLOW-1004","ref":"AIRFLOW-1004","sha":"3fb2e991ee7d5c4df2ac3eab5c58f62de9c8caa3","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59171319,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTE3MTMxOQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"sekikn/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn/airflow","description":"Apache

JIRA\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-922\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis updates [`PrestoHook`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/b55f41f2c22e210d130a0b42586f0385bd5515a7/airflow/hooks/presto_hook.py) so that it can block until a statement finishes executing. Currently, [`PrestoHook.run`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/b55f41f2c22e210d130a0b42586f0385bd5515a7/airflow/hooks/presto_hook.py#L104-L108) returns as soon as it sends a statement, so Operators that use it won't [run synchronously](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/b55f41f2c22e210d130a0b42586f0385bd5515a7/airflow/models.py#L1788-L1789).\r\n\r\nThere are other, minor changes too that seemed worth making (hence the separate commits), though they're unrelated to the primary goal of this PR. Of course if you'd rather jettison those, or put them in a separate PR, that's fine by me.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nI added [some](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/58ed2995867d9dc89b589270642849b6841b4b9b/tests/contrib/hooks/presto_hook_test.py) under `tests/contrib/hooks`, though I wasn't sure if that was the proper location. (`PrestoHook` is built in, not user-contributed, but AFAICT there are no existing tests for it.) \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\nI haven't squashed commits yet, because I wanted to keep the history easy to see until the code is in a satisfactory state. Once it is, I'm happy to rewrite the commit history (unless you plan to just squash and merge to take care of that?).","created_at":"2017-03-31T18:45:49Z","updated_at":"2019-06-20T18:42:33Z","closed_at":"2019-04-23T02:07:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b8996de013e5022d72b08bff5d8af44d469c875c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2206/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2206/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2206/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/bd1c4d65b654fe3ea2843de7568cbc953d081aca","head":{"label":"patrickmckenna:update-presto-hook","ref":"update-presto-hook","sha":"bd1c4d65b654fe3ea2843de7568cbc953d081aca","user":{"login":"patrickmckenna","id":3589536,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODk1MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3589536?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna","html_url":"https://github.com/patrickmckenna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":68959655,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2ODk1OTY1NQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"patrickmckenna/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"patrickmckenna","id":3589536,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODk1MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3589536?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna","html_url":"https://github.com/patrickmckenna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmckenna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/patrickmckenna/airflow","description":"Apache

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1028\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIn this PR we contribute a new DatabricksSubmitRunOperator.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n(I plan to squash my commits before

For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1052\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAIRFLOW-863 broke dags/test_dag.py and it can not be imported now.\r\nThis PR fixes it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis fix is really trivial and I confirmed that it worked locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title:\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1035\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\nThe way that exponential backoff is currently calculated is by exponentiating the initial `retry_delay` directly. This makes any `retry_delay` above a few seconds unusable for exponential backoff - for example, for the default delay of 5 minutes, the second retry will be after 25 hours, and the third one - after 312 days.\r\nThis PR replaces this calculation with a more standard exponential backoff algorithm - namely, using the initial `retry_delay` simply as a multiplier, and the base for the exponentiation is **2**.\r\nSee e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff or https://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2015/03/backoff.html for reference.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n- modifies `TaskInstanceTest.test_next_retry_datetime` to verify the new behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-28T09:33:53Z","updated_at":"2017-04-07T17:35:37Z","closed_at":"2017-04-07T17:35:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"83e0823fe67586329c834980fd2c7ee899e0467a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2196/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2196/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2196/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/eb1e794fcc3e73ba58004afe940e921ed2cfaef3","head":{"label":"heap-legacy:exponential-backoff","ref":"exponential-backoff","sha":"eb1e794fcc3e73ba58004afe940e921ed2cfaef3","user":{"login":"heap-legacy","id":141373379,"node_id":"O_kgDOCG0vww","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/141373379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy","html_url":"https://github.com/heap-legacy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86438897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjQzODg5Nw==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"heap-legacy/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"heap-legacy","id":141373379,"node_id":"O_kgDOCG0vww","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/141373379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy","html_url":"https://github.com/heap-legacy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heap-legacy/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/heap-legacy/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title:\r\n\r\n   https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1027\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue when a functools.partial function was used in a PythonOperator. The task details view crashed due to being unable to resolve the partial functions source code. The fix now loads the partial function source accordingly, if a partial function is supplied with a PythonOperator.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the following untittest:\r\n\r\ncore tests: `test_dag_view_task_with_python_operator_using_partial` by using a DAG that contains a PythonOperator which uses a functools.partial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

In other cases, the parameters were under the __init__ section, so they didn't appear in documentation.\r\n\r\nRunning things through flake8 I noticed some pep8 inconsistencies too and cleaned them up.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1042/) issue and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1042\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis improvement uses Docker and Docker Compose to give\r\ncontributors a very simple way to create a ready-made\r\nenvironment for unit testing. To run unit tests is\r\na two step process:\r\n\r\n> docker-compose up -d\r\n> ./scripts/docker/unittest/run.sh tests.core:CoreTest\r\n\r\nThe run.sh script calls run_unit_tests.sh inside of a Docker\r\ncontainer. Arguments like \"tests.core:CoreTest -s\r\n--logging-level=DEBUG\" can be passed as usual.\r\n\r\nContributors will only need to have Docker and Docker-Compose\r\ninstalled for this to work. The local Airflow source directory\r\nis mapped as a volume in a container so that any edits to\r\nsource files are available for testing in the container.\r\n\r\nRight now all core tests succeed. All other tests succeed except\r\nHive, LDAP, and SSH tests, but those can be addressed soon.\r\n\r\nThis use of Docker could also be expanded to cover all tests\r\nand potentially to run all of the tox tests like Travis does.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n    - Running all of the unit tests is the new test itself \r\n    - Travis succeeds on my fork\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-26T12:13:01Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T07:36:20Z","closed_at":"2018-09-04T07:36:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"823a30e7c9e778ef21e9e7c75e7c2da22da77330","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2187/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2187/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2187/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/15c2c1dd988a27e45beccda8d0e82fc5f9e80a0d","head":{"label":"joeschmid:AIRFLOW-1042-docker-unit-testing","ref":"AIRFLOW-1042-docker-unit-testing","sha":"15c2c1dd988a27e45beccda8d0e82fc5f9e80a0d","user":{"login":"joeschmid","id":2823453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MjM0NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2823453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid","html_url":"https://github.com/joeschmid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":85882635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NTg4MjYzNQ==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"joeschmid/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"joeschmid","id":2823453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MjM0NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2823453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid","html_url":"https://github.com/joeschmid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/joeschmid/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1038\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes: We should specify the serializers explicitly as it causes an issue when different processes run different versions of celery, and not all types are supported by json.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: The issue is only observable across multiple hosts and is hard to test. Either way, the celery_executor tests should test whether this is sane and all this does it keep it the same as the defaults in <4.0\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n@bolkedebruin @plypaul @artwr @aoen

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1034\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the opportunity to specify a `host`-parameter in the `extra params`-section, which is necessary to be able to authenticate with \"Signature v4\"-only regions: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-2.html\r\n\r\n**Example connection string:**\r\n\r\n    {\"aws_access_key_id\": \"\",\r\n    \"aws_secret_access_key\": \"\",\r\n    \"host\": \"s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com\"}\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n* Any ideas of how to actually add meaningful unit tests for this is welcome \r\n* We have been using this patch in production for >3 months, but it'd be great if someone else could test it so that it's not breaking anything.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Travis\r\n\r\nBackfillJob._execute() checks that the next run date is less than\r\nor equal to the end date before creating a DAG run and task\r\ninstances. For SubDAGs, the next run date is not relevant,\r\ni.e. schedule_interval can be anything other than None\r\nor '@once' and should be ignored. However, current code calculates\r\nthe next run date for a SubDAG and the condition check mentioned\r\nabove always fails for a SubDAG triggered manually, hence the tasks\r\nin the SubDAG will never be executed.\r\n\r\nThis change adds a simple check to determine if this is a SubDAG\r\nand, if so, sets next run date to DAG run's start date.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-23T04:31:06Z","updated_at":"2017-04-04T06:28:24Z","closed_at":"2017-04-04T06:28:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c2bbbafea2dd5cdd0f404dc64832f5f96f789354","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2179/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2179/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2179/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/b40f52f9c5a9345a9e7eab16eddd1ee3ba619bcd","head":{"label":"joeschmid:AIRFLOW-1011-fix-bug-backfill-execute-for-subdags","ref":"AIRFLOW-1011-fix-bug-backfill-execute-for-subdags","sha":"b40f52f9c5a9345a9e7eab16eddd1ee3ba619bcd","user":{"login":"joeschmid","id":2823453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MjM0NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2823453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid","html_url":"https://github.com/joeschmid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":85882635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NTg4MjYzNQ==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"joeschmid/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"joeschmid","id":2823453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MjM0NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2823453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid","html_url":"https://github.com/joeschmid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeschmid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/joeschmid/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title:\r\n\r\n   https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1023\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR provides a work around in the S3 hook to a boto issue that results in `Connection reset by peer` errors when uploading files to S3 buckets that are located in non standard US locations (e.g. eu-west-1).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo unit test is provided, since the S3 related functionality in `S3_hook.py` is not covered with unit tests and this is inherent to S3 and will be hard (if not impossible) to mock.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1006\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n@bolkedebruin [pointed out](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/1da7450c96c631a75da96ba00f6d3ad116c9061b#commitcomment-21392365) that the new config templates are not included when Airflow is installed, something I didn't catch because I run Airflow out of the dev directory (and I guess unit tests do too?). The solution is to add them to Airflow's `MANIFEST`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  Airflow is already being installed in the test environment, but clearly with access to all files.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n@aoen @criccomini @jlowin (BTW suggestion: Target for 1.9.0, as 1.8.X will be bug fix

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA]\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1012\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIt would be great to extend jinja templating to sql parameter for SQL Operators so that it can generate multiple statements.\r\n\r\nWith this improvement, it's possible to have extended Jinja template like below that generates multiple SQL statements that can be passed as a single 'sql' parameter, separated by ';' separator:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    )\r\n    >> OracleOperator( task_id='give_owner_grants', oracle_conn_id=ora_conn1, run_as_script=True,\r\n        sql='''\r\n          {% for role in ['CONNECT', 'RESOURCE'] %}\r\n          GRANT {{ role }} TO {{ schema }};\r\n          {% endfor %}\r\n\r\n          {% for create_grant in ['PROCEDURE', 'SEQUENCE', 'SESSION', 'TABLE', 'VIEW'] %}\r\n          GRANT CREATE {{ create_grant }} TO {{ schema }};\r\n          {% endfor %}\r\n\r\n          {% for tbsp in ['DISCOVER_MART_IDX01', 'DISCOVER_MART_TBS01', 'STAGING_NOLOG'] %}\r\n          ALTER USER {{ schema }} QUOTA UNLIMITED ON {{ tbsp }};\r\n          {% endfor %}\r\n\r\n          GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE TO {{ schema }};\r\n          GRANT EXECUTE ON SYS.DBMS_SESSION TO {{ schema }};\r\n        '''\r\n    )\r\n    >> DummyOperator(task_id='stop')\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice there are three Jinja 'for' loops that generate multiple SQL DDL statements. \r\n\r\nWithout this change, sql has to be passed as an Python array, and Jinja templating can't be used.\r\n\r\nAlso this change should be quite useful to pass SQL scripts more natively - as a list of ;-separated SQL statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI've tested this change with OracleOperator and works as expected. \r\nNotice `run_as_script=True` parameter. run_as_script defaults to False so this is a backward-compatible change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\nMost of the change is in airflow/hooks/dbapi_hook.py (very straightforward as run() already supports running an array of statements) and a light change of airflow/operators/oracle_operator.py - so this change can be easily applied to other sql operators. Please let me know if you'd like to extend this to other (not only oracle) operators - that will be easier to do too.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-19T19:35:52Z","updated_at":"2018-04-28T19:11:57Z","closed_at":"2018-04-22T01:30:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c9972e59988233e5dfa101bab1996313847b8b8f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2170/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2170/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2170/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/3f170b6a8dd36b738752c85de5c3fa10d6ee8f3d","head":{"label":"Tagar:master","ref":"master","sha":"3f170b6a8dd36b738752c85de5c3fa10d6ee8f3d","user":{"login":"Tagar","id":3013418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTM0MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3013418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":85431937,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NTQzMTkzNw==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"Tagar/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Tagar","id":3013418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTM0MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3013418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Tagar/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1005\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1006\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n#### AIRFLOW-1005\r\nAirflow takes approximately 1 second to import. It turns out that more than half the time is spent doing two things: importing Cryptography to create Fernet keys and importing Alembic. This PR defers those actions until they are required, improving startup time 50%. Sorry @bolkedebruin, it doesn't really affect unit test times. \r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-17 at 6 04 23 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/153965/24064867/78724864-0b3d-11e7-9618-4a4da6622f8d.png)\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nThe first Cryptography import is in `configuration.py` and is only necessary if Airflow is generating a new airflow.cfg file (but currently gets run every time). Therefore it can be easily deferred.\r\n\r\nThe second is in `models.py` to check if encryption is turned on. This can also be deferred until encryption checks are actually needed.\r\n\r\nAlembic is always imported even though it is only needed for running `initdb()` and `upgradedb()`. It can be lazily imported inside those functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### AIRFLOW-1006\r\nIn addition, I applied AIRFLOW-1006 which takes the current config templates (just giant strings inside configuration.py) and makes them standalone files. This makes them much easier to work with.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  This adds no new functionality, just reorganizes existing code so it is more lazily executed\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue (though see above note!). In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] Add new feature\"\r\n- [x] Multiple commits addressing the same JIRA issue have been squashed\r\n- [x] My commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n  3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-17T00:03:07Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T19:56:29Z","closed_at":"2017-03-17T19:56:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aff46a62fad856a2ba362bf20359c53d2291cab0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2163/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2163/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2163/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/e79fbabf0b26b3386f2b16651cd3b7d5e13d4906","head":{"label":"jlowin:pr-template-2","ref":"pr-template-2","sha":"e79fbabf0b26b3386f2b16651cd3b7d5e13d4906","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54388220,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDM4ODIyMA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"jlowin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin/airflow","description":"Airflow

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### Opened PR\r\n- [x] Opened a PR on Github\r\n\r\n\r\n### [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/)\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Airflow JIRA issues:\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-995\r\n- [x] The PR title references the JIRA issues. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Airflow PR\"\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds unit tests\r\n- [X] __OR__ my PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- It's a lowly template adjustment, not new functionality\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n\r\nThe current PR template looks great when previewed but is harder to parse in \"edit\" mode, which is how all PR authors see it initially. My goal with this template is to make one that is very clear in both edit and preview and also includes explicit action (checking boxes) to engage authors with each required step\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are screenshots of any UI changes, if appropriate:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] Each commit subject references a JIRA issue. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-1] Add new feature\"\r\n- [x] Multiple commits addressing the same JIRA issue have been squashed\r\n- [x] My commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n  3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-825 (automate passing data between operators)\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-915 (allow task to modify context in pre_execute())\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- New unit tests for `Pipeline` and `FileSystemPipeline`\r\n\r\n#### Overview\r\n\r\nPipelines (formerly \"dataflow\") are a \"high level\" interface that allow data generated by one Operator to be easily accessed by another. \r\n\r\nIt has always been possible to do this manually (and indeed, most users do) by writing and alternatively reading data from parameterized locations in local or remote storage or through the XCom system. Pipelines automate that cumbersome work by introducing a customizable API for \"piping\" data through storage automatically.\r\n\r\n(Note: this supersedes #2046 and is intended to address concerns with that implementation, chiefly the need to modify Airflow core. This version [and the fact that it is in contrib] should alleviate those worries.)\r\n\r\n#### Implementation\r\n\r\nPipelines are implemented entirely through `pre_execute()` and `post_execute()` hooks as well as the `XCom` protocol. The files live in `contrib` so they are clearly \"outside\" Airflow proper, though it is my hope that they will prove useful to many people. \r\n\r\nDifferent Pipeline classes use different storage: the default (`Pipeline`) uses XComs. Once #2048 is merged, this will only work for small data. I have also included a `FileSystemPipeline` that writes data to the local filesystem (and should only be used on single-machine Airflow installs) and `GCSPipeline` that writes to Google Cloud Storage.\r\n\r\nUsers can extend Pipelines easily to use their preferred storage locations; the implementations of `GCSPipeline` and `FileSystemPipeline` show how lightweight extensions can be.\r\n\r\nAll Pipeline classes accept `serialize` and `deserialize` parameters -- these are functions that tell the Pipeline how to convert data to its remote representation. The default is JSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Sample use:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nwith dag:\r\n\r\n    # ----\r\n    # create a task that generates data\r\n    upstream_task = PythonOperator(\r\n        task_id='upstream_task',\r\n        python_callable=lambda: {'output_1': 1, 'output_2': [2, 3]})\r\n\r\n    # ----\r\n    # create a task to work with that data\r\n    downstream_task = PythonOperator(\r\n        task_id='downstream_task',\r\n        python_callable=lambda x: x + 1)\r\n\r\n    # ----\r\n    # create a pipeline to automatically move data from the upstream task to the downstream task\r\n    Pipeline(\r\n        # identify the downstream task\r\n        downstream_task=downstream_task,\r\n\r\n        # the pipelined data will be available in the context under this key.\r\n        # since the task is a PythonOperator, it will also be passed as a kwarg.\r\n        downstream_key='x',\r\n\r\n        # specify the upstream task\r\n        upstream_task=upstream_task,\r\n\r\n        # the upstream task's result will be indexed by this optional key\r\n        upstream_key='output_1'\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    # ----\r\n    # or use the add_pipeline convenience function (this is equivalent to the above command)\r\n    add_pipeline(\r\n        downstream_task=downstream_task,\r\n        pipelines={\r\n            'x': {'task': upstream_task, 'key': output_1}\r\n        }\r\n    )\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing `FileSystemPipeline` or `GCSPipeline` is identical, just dropping the class in appropriately (or passing the `pipeline_class` argument to

   The refactor to use dag runs in backfills caused a regression\r\n    in task execution performance as dag runs were executed\r\n    sequentially. Next to that, the backfills were non deterministic\r\n    due to the random execution of tasks, causing root tasks\r\n    being added to the non ready list too soon.\r\n\r\n    This updates the backfill logic as follows:\r\n    * Parallelize execution of tasks\r\n    * Use a leave first execution model; Breadth-first algorithm by Jerermiah\r\n    * Replace state updates from the executor by task based only\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- *(MANDATORY - replace with a link to JIRA - e.g. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX)*\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\r\nspecify why you think this is not required.

Please open a new issue if required!\r\n\r\n* For all PRs with UI changes, you must provide screenshots. If the UI changes are not obvious, either annotate the images or provide before/after screenshots.\r\n\r\n* Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \r\nSummarized as follows:\r\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\r\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\r\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\r\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\r\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\r\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-11T17:47:05Z","updated_at":"2017-03-11T21:15:20Z","closed_at":"2017-03-11T17:48:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7401989b835017620115b593d19eb42e805d5a34","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2145/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2145/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2145/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/5e262b798aa83964df9ef248b9fc00e4a42aaae9","head":{"label":"bolkedebruin:AIRFLOW-910","ref":"AIRFLOW-910","sha":"5e262b798aa83964df9ef248b9fc00e4a42aaae9","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38505714,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODUwNTcxNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"bolkedebruin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin/airflow","description":"AirFlow

accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-956\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Built on readthedocs at http://incubator-airflow.readthedocs.io/en/airflow-956-configparser/ off my fork and spot checked pages, notably the contrib/3rd party stuff. Using changes in this branch plus addition of configparser as dependency (see https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2130)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, older releases will be broken still unless we patch them. But at least moving forward, we should have versioned docs.\r\n\r\nWe also have a number of warnings in the doc building right now (non-existing attributes mentioned, indents/spacing, etc) that I'll see if I can cleanup in a separate pull. QuboleOperator also has an odd error that I need to look into, but it doesn't seem to show up in current/local docs either so I left it for now.\r\n\r\nAfter merging, http://airflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ should build properly (existing RTD project by @mistercrunch). Whoever has maintainer access to it, I'd suggest:\r\n\r\n* Disable 'stable' version until we have a stable version. When we do have a stable version, I think that'd be the more appropriate default version (rather than 'latest').\r\n* Remember to set versions as active once we have older versions that build.\r\n* Set email notifications for build failures to...probably not dev list, maybe a committers list if that exists?\r\n* There are some domain settings as well if we want to update https://airflow.incubator.apache.org/\r\n* Also http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/webhooks.html#github would be good to enable (on github repo side)","created_at":"2017-03-09T04:01:28Z","updated_at":"2017-03-09T21:53:47Z","closed_at":"2017-03-09T04:57:14Z","merged_at":"2017-03-09T04:57:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"f4be54f2535ca13819e20e742a8ed6ae522d1a17","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2133/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2133/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2133/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/f4be54f2535ca13819e20e742a8ed6ae522d1a17","head":{"label":"dhuang:AIRFLOW-956","ref":"AIRFLOW-956","sha":"f4be54f2535ca13819e20e742a8ed6ae522d1a17","user":{"login":"dhuang","id":1597448,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc0NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1597448?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/dhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":80047105,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MDA0NzEwNQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"dhuang/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dhuang","id":1597448,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc0NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1597448?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/dhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dhuang/airflow","description":"Apache

accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n - [AIRFLOW-860](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-860)\r\n - [AIRFLOW-935](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-935)\r\n\r\n\r\n## ISSUE 1 ([AIRFLOW-860](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-860)):\r\nWhen a plugin is made with a custom Operator and executor, an import cycle occurs when the executor is chosen in airflow.cfg because the executors/__init__.py starts loading plugins too early when a non standard executor is chosen.\r\n\r\n### To reproduce:\r\nMake a plugin with both a custom operator (derived from BaseOperator) and a custom executor. Then use the custom executor in airflow.cfg to trigger the import loop. It will fail to resolve BaseOperator, since the plugin contains \"import airflow.models\" and models.py will trigger a plugin load again because it imports executors.DEFAULT_EXECUTOR. \r\nexecutors/__init__.py loads the plugins when an unknown executor is specified in airflow.cfg.\r\nSpitting the plugin executor and operator into separate modules or even plugins does not resolve the problem\r\n\r\n### fix:\r\nchanged DEFAULT_EXECUTOR use to a function call which returns the default executor. This lazy approach fixes the import cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n## ISSUE 2 [AIRFLOW-935](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-935):\r\n\r\nrevision eb5982d4aac135051666d2977bbf6adfc8b9e2a7 (included in 1.8) breaks plugin executors altogether. It makes a new module for every plugin, so import statements need to be adapted, but the executor selection is left unchanged, so it ends up passing the plugin module as the executor (instead of the actual executor class).\r\n\r\n### fix:\r\nfixed executor selection to work with the new plugin modules system. in Airflow.cfg a executor can now be specified as {pugin_name}.{executor_name}\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing Done:\r\nThe current tests do not cover these issues at all. Tested with custom plugins in v1-8-stable and master.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-02T13:41:56Z","updated_at":"2017-06-21T08:21:33Z","closed_at":"2017-05-13T10:57:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0ff8c2e956d7d581d76f0079eeb43e6c8a989b78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2120/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2120/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2120/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/d8faabb26d1eb71de7db31167435d3965a0b79fc","head":{"label":"stverhae:master","ref":"master","sha":"d8faabb26d1eb71de7db31167435d3965a0b79fc","user":{"login":"stverhae","id":14187177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTg3MTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14187177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae","html_url":"https://github.com/stverhae","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83673080,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzY3MzA4MA==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"stverhae/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stverhae","id":14187177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTg3MTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14187177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae","html_url":"https://github.com/stverhae","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stverhae/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stverhae/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n-  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-931\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- I added a test, but the problem is only found when using LocalExecutor. The test passes with SequentialExecutor (trivially, as the race condition doesn't happen there). I tried manually setting things up to run the unit tests with LocalExecutor but couldn't get it working.  However when installing from master and running the `test_queued_with_concurrency_dag` I added it would always get stuck with two of the tasks as enqueued but never running.  My branch stops that from happening.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/ef6dd1b29b794c5e0fd4f2bc8422a386395950f5 breaks things on python 2.7.10. I had to manually revert that in order to test all of this.
