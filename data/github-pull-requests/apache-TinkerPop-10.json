PR removes the old jcabi manifest system to pass the project version from maven into java. The new system uses `com.google.code.maven-replacer-plugin` to directly inject the project version into the source code of gremlin-core and the GLV's. This system will inject the current project version into the source code during the `generate-sources` phase in maven anytime something such as `mvn clean install` is run. It can also be triggered manually by running `mvn replacer:replace`\r\n\r\nVOTE

JanusGraph we would like to make some optimizations to `LabelStep` (https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/issues/3813).\r\n\r\nWe need to extend `LabelStep` with additional logic. Even so it's quite simple to implement our own `LabelStep`, it's a little bit dangerous because TinkerPop's `LabelStep` may be used in some optimization strategies (including user-provided optimization strategies). If we replace `LabelStep` with something which doesn't extend `LabelStep` then we may risk breaking some strategies.\r\n\r\nFor example, here are the places in TinkerPop where `step instanceof LabelStep` is checked:\r\n1) https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/f00cfe5592ef45e64fb45737a16ec5877a824958/gremlin-core/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/process/traversal/strategy/optimization/ByModulatorOptimizationStrategy.java#L98\r\n2)

I propose to remove `final` class declaration for `LabelStep`, so that graph providers could extend this step.\r\nThe step looks fairly stable.\r\n\r\nRelated issue:

adds functionality similar to `GremlinGroovyScriptEngine` where bindings can be applied to a script as in `g.V(x)` where `x` is a variable that can be bound to a value external to the script. This functionality doesn't offer any particular performance enhancement for the grammar the way that it does for groovy but it does better allow one engine to be swapped for the other which is crucial for a migration away from the groovy engine. This change also opens up better opportunities for translator and gherkin improvements as well.\r\n\r\nPurposefully did not add upgrade docs as I still don't think this functionality is completely ready for general usage.\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly large diff because it essentially rewrites the core of the antlr grammar and that force a rewrite of much of the parser. It might be best to focus on what's being tested and to try to determine if anything further should be tested in relation to this functionality. \r\n\r\nPerformance testing showed that somehow, these changes actually made the parser a tiny bit faster. I basically ran all the Gremlin (minus a few troublemakers) in the documentation (about 600 queries) through the parser 10000 times. My runs with these changes tended to finish in about 65~ seconds typically. Runs on `master` prior to these changes typically ran around 72~ seconds. Here's the script which I just pasted into Gremlin Console (if you want to run be sure to replace `TINKERPOP_HOME_PATH` with the path to your TinkerPop git repo home:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\nimport

noticed extreme memory usage in recent versions of TinkerPop. After some investigation I found that this was because the task that is scheduled to cancel the query if it doesn't complete in time is not cancelled when the query completes.\r\n\r\nThis means that if the timeout is large and you have high throughput on the graph, memory starts adding up. On my laptop with Aerospike Graph, I was seeing ~1 GB per second growth in memory until it hit about 10 GB and then my system would slow down and eventually OOME.\r\n\r\nI added a cancel for this in this PR to fix this issue and tested it and the memory growth does not happen.

href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/releases\">Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v17.6.2</h2>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<p>This patch addresses the problems that were introduced in 17.6.0 that happen when running on AzDo with the default <em>test</em>.dll filter, which includes additional TestPlatform dlls into the run and fails it.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this issue we solved the bug in 17.6.1, and added additional exclusions for known assemblies that are coming from TestPlatform and commonly used test adapters, to avoid trying to run tests from those assemblies.</p>\n<p>Description and workarounds for this issue are available here: <a

Portable or .NET Standard dlls are provided to the run, the run crashes with &quot;No suitable test runtime provider was found&quot;, which is a regression introduced in 17.6.0.\n<img

latest issues,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fix no-suitable provider found by <a href=\"https://github.com/nohwnd\"><code>@​nohwnd</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/vstest/pull/4474\">microsoft/vstest#4474</a> which fixes <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/vstest/issues/4467\">#4467</a></p>\n<p>When .NET Portable or .NET Standard dlls are provided to the run, the run crashes with &quot;No suitable test runtime provider was found&quot;, which is a regression introduced in 17.6.0.\n<img

href=\"https://github.com/nohwnd\"><code>@​nohwnd</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/vstest/pull/4480\">microsoft/vstest#4480</a> which fixes <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/vstest/issues/4378\">#4378</a></p>\n<p>Running --blame-hang and --blame-crash at the same time, can result in --blame-hang cancelling --blame-crash, and killing the testhost in the process, resulting in no dumps being created. This fix waits for --blame-crash to finish dumping the process, and then it creates hang dump.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Update Nuget.Frameworks by <a href=\"https://github.com/nohwnd\"><code>@​nohwnd</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/vstest/pull/4500\">microsoft/vstest#4500</a> which fixes <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/vstest/issues/4409\">#4409</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Internal updates:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Update dependencies from devdiv/DevDiv/vs-code-coverage by <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet-maestro\"><code>@​dotnet-maestro</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/vstest/pull/4479\">microsoft/vstest#4479</a></li>\n<li>Disable internal build on new pipeline by <a href=\"https://github.com/nohwnd\"><code>@​nohwnd</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/vstest/pull/4476\">microsoft/vstest#4476</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/compare/v17.6.0...v17.6.1\">https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/compare/v17.6.0...v17.6.1</a></p>\n<h3>Artifacts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>TestPlatform vsix: <a href=\"https://vsdrop.corp.microsoft.com/file/v1/Products/DevDiv/microsoft/vstest/17.6/v17.6.1;/TestPlatform.vsix\">17.6.1</a></li>\n<li>Microsoft.TestPlatform.ObjectModel : <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.TestPlatform.ObjectModel/17.6.1\">17.6.1</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/blob/main/docs/releases.md\">Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>17.6.1 and newer</h2>\n<p>Please see release notes directly in the release page: <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/releases\">https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/releases</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/commit/5121d9feaef6811adc92efb56e1cffc494c8dfb5\"><code>5121d9f</code></a> [rel/17.6] Update Nuget.Frameworks (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/vstest/issues/4500\">#4500</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/commit/00967c5d2d42e9485fe1726376ded79491a4e973\"><code>00967c5</code></a> [rel/17.6] Fix hangdump running into crashdump (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/vstest/issues/4480\">#4480</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/commit/90efc14193228735cd6849ed6641b6b5c6d9b5af\"><code>90efc14</code></a> Disable internal build on new pipeline (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/vstest/issues/4476\">#4476</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/commit/0e34e21ef919eac5904a20b8862bc273350a0c46\"><code>0e34e21</code></a> Merge branch 'rel/17.6' of <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vstest\">https://github.com/microsoft/vstest</a> into rel/17.6</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/commit/1db7dc07ac94db3648e1aafed49d810e534f3650\"><code>1db7dc0</code></a> Bump to 17.6.1 in targets</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/commit/7f3dc2208ea3cd7d3aebe91b48090b063d110a5a\"><code>7f3dc22</code></a> [rel/17.6] Update dependencies from devdiv/DevDiv/vs-code-coverage (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/vstest/issues/4479\">#4479</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/commit/a6e34a16ee0ecb4bdf010614c85d6fcc2253867e\"><code>a6e34a1</code></a> Revert &quot;Bump Microsoft.VisualStudio.Telemetry to 16.6.13&quot;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/commit/6115490c4925f60b008465205efd936756f7bd27\"><code>6115490</code></a> Bump Microsoft.VisualStudio.Telemetry to 16.6.13</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/commit/68649f267286d46d05f21cdca91ae5374ac1beaa\"><code>68649f2</code></a> Re-order sources to restore signed packages</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/commit/0d079b412745daad3edbdc1d4a359084525fdf13\"><code>0d079b4</code></a> Update branding to 17.6.1</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/compare/v17.6.0...v17.6.1\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk&package-manager=nuget&previous-version=17.6.0&new-version=17.6.1)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

think many of us have observed many random CI failures stemming from Java CodeQL. In my observations these failures have always been during the autobuild phase (typically when trying to load the antlr runtime as part of gremlin-language). This PR switches Java codeQL to use a manual build instruction instead and restricts it to only building gremlin-core, gremlin-groovy, gremlin-driver, gremlin-server, and tinkergraph-gremlin.\r\n\r\nI believe this will resolve the unreliable build failures while retaining the existing vulnerability scanning.","created_at":"2023-04-20T21:26:42Z","updated_at":"2023-05-19T16:58:35Z","closed_at":"2023-04-21T01:08:25Z","merged_at":"2023-04-21T01:08:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"d31fdfbb19b891a52dd061924696e9a7bacae01a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/2035/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/2035/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2035/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/fbedcad98623fd32b893bcdfb57ad99f8afd5265","head":{"label":"Bit-Quill:cole/javaCodeQl","ref":"cole/javaCodeQl","sha":"fbedcad98623fd32b893bcdfb57ad99f8afd5265","user":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506343924,"node_id":"R_kgDOHi4x9A","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

in gremlin-javascript arose due to Direction aliases `from_` and `to` not properly returning `Direction.OUT` and `Direction.IN`.\r\n\r\nAlso found similar issue in gremlin-python, where `Direction.from_` and `Direction.to` were not added to the `Direction` enum. They can now be used directly without the need to declare `from_ = Direction.OUT` and `to = Direction.IN`.\r\n\r\nThe existing Gherkin test as `g_mergeEXlabel_knows_out_marko_in_vadasX_aliased_direction` covers the case, although customized alias maps in feature-steps masked the issue in python and javascript, which are now removed.\r\n\r\nThis issue doesn't seem to appear in gremlin-go and gremlin-dotnet.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2893\r\n\r\nPredicates that contain negative numbers aren't handled correctly by the current CountStrategy implementation. In particular, the use of the highRange to determine when to use not() or to remove the count().is() doesn't account for these cases. This leads to the optimization being applied when it shouldn't be. This commit temporarily solves this by disabling the optimization in these cases. Further work could be done to selectively apply the optimization as there are some cases even with predicates that contain negative numbers where it could be applied.","created_at":"2023-04-19T22:57:52Z","updated_at":"2023-04-21T23:12:55Z","closed_at":"2023-04-21T23:12:55Z","merged_at":"2023-04-21T23:12:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"ad09d1de84dff91969a819c229e52e04621a68db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/2033/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/2033/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2033/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/1e65523d4fa92d51d1e676d9a64d77595667f715","head":{"label":"Bit-Quill:ken/TINKERPOP-2893","ref":"ken/TINKERPOP-2893","sha":"1e65523d4fa92d51d1e676d9a64d77595667f715","user":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506343924,"node_id":"R_kgDOHi4x9A","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","description":"Apache
