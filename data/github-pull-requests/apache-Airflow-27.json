three eslint rules that proved to be too prescriptive. Based on discussion over at https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/42711#discussion_r1787630877\r\n\r\n- `jsx-no-bind` forces premature use of `useCallback`, which itself can lead to performance issues. Maintainers should still try to encourage defining functions outside of the component.\r\n- `complexity` quite subjective. Maintainers should use discretion.\r\n- `max-lines-per-function` also very subjective. Maintainers should use direction.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n- make sure that `coverage` reports are ignored by eslint and prettier\r\n- Add eslint-ignore for the test mocks that use null.

PR is based on a previous PR that was approved but not merged, because not all unit tests were passing: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/39897 \r\nWhich was in its turn based on another PR proposition: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/27581 \r\n\r\nI fixed a few unit tests that were not passing last time, and I think it should be good this time.\r\n\r\nTo quote the previous description from the first PR: \r\n\r\n> Minor fix, which allows to use the schema which are specified in the schema rather than http as default. In the same time it doesn't change the logic as any conn_type can be selected. Intuitevely it's expected that anything specified in schema field will actually take precedence in building the desired url.\r\n\r\nLet me know if any improvement are required.

Instead of being directly executed as inline command.\r\n\r\n![Pasted image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46e5dbc6-1d21-417c-b9b6-ee3440dca052)\r\n\r\n*Note*: No changes / side-effect when executing a inline command or a script without Jinja templating ( `.sh ` with space).\r\n\r\n### Why ?\r\nWhen using templated bash command, the rendered string can be longer than the maximum argument length. This causes [`\"Argument list too long\"`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57251024/exact-limit-to-avoid-argument-list-too-long) error.\r\n\r\nWithout this PR, currently, the bash command is passed as argument into `[\"bash\", \"-c\", command]`. The `command` cannot be longer than the max length of the system.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the user can write his command into a bash file. The file is jinja-rendered and executed as a file, which bypass the maximum argument length limit.\r\n\r\n### Breaking change\r\nThe BashOperator writes the rendered file to the disk. By default, it's in a temporary directory (`/tmp`) where Airflow has *write* access (in a common Linux system). However, if the user specify a `cwd` directory where Airflow cannot write, task will fail.\r\n\r\nBackport #43191 warns the user when permissions are missing, and fallback to executing the script as inline command.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

method uses Backfill internally.  Before we can remove BackfillJobRunner, we need to remove DAG.run.  But before we can remove DAG.run, we need to update some old tests that use it.  So this is the first step towards removing BackflilJobRunner.\r\n\r\nThere were some very old tests that came from airflow github issue 1225.  These appeared to test the scheduler but really they tested the backfill job runner.  Just to be cautious, I kept most of them rather than remove (which probably would have been fine since they essentially tested code that we'll be removing).  As appropriate I either changed them to run on dag.test or scheduler.

TEST_UTILS CI selection has been using \"tests/utils\" as a trigger to trigger full tests, but it turned out that there is another shared test folder \"tests/test_utils\" that also should do it (i.e.

things do no quite make sense today in auth managers:\r\n\r\n- `is_authorized_dag(\"GET\")` means \"is the user authorized to access all DAGs\". After discussion with Ash [here](https://apache-airflow.slack.com/archives/C06K9Q5G2UA/p1728054131890969), I realized it should mean \"is the user authorized to list DAGs\". We should not care whether the user has access to all DAGs.\r\n\r\n- `get_permitted_dag_ids` takes a list of methods as parameter. Example: `auth_manager.get_permitted_dag_ids(methods=[\"GET\", \"PUT\"])` would return the list of DAGs the user can read or edit. We need either one of the other but not both.\r\n\r\nThis PR creates breaking change in the auth manage interface.\r\n\r\nThis is a draft PR for now to confirm the direction, if agreed, I'll create a news fragment, update tests and handle the backward compatibility between core Airflow and providers.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Added method `extract_queue_info` to fetch detailed information of all jobs in Jenkins queue.\r\n- It extracts task, stuck, why, blocked and build info from the Jenkins queue.\r\n- Enhanced logging to detect and warn if a job is stuck in the queue.\r\n- Included a verbose option to log detailed job information.\r\n- Added a new unit test `test_poll_job_in_queue_stuck_job` to validate the behavior when a job is stuck in the Jenkins queue.\r\n- The TODO was: Use get_queue_info once it will be available in python-jenkins (v > 0.4.15)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation

this looks like a ticket, but it's an edit with explanation...\r\n\r\nAfter spinning up Airflow using docker, a reference to the \"example_dags\" folder doesn't make sense.  It's not clear how to create your first dag.  The docker docs reference the web UI, but there's no way in the UI to create or edit a dag.  At least there's no docs on that.\r\n\r\nDocumentation on docker shows that \"dags\" is volume mounted.  So does this mean I should create \"airflow/dags/example_dags/tutorial.py\" or just \"airflow/dags/tutorial.py\".\r\n\r\nThe folder names are not lining up.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to create \"dags/example/tutorial.py\"?  I'm new to Airflow, but I'm guessing over some time there will be dozens of python scripts and some folder structure makes sense.  If so, the tutorial should tell the user to create a folder in the dags folder and put the tutorial.py file there.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
