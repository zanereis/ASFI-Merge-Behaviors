For example, \"[AIRFLOW-1213] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1213\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis commit will add additional parameters to specify a hive table instead of a hdfs directory. This will also source the schema from the hive metastore.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-17T09:38:31Z","updated_at":"2017-09-09T21:19:25Z","closed_at":"2017-05-17T18:49:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e80789a60eb309f6259b7dedb268d1559d2e2dea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2305/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2305/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2305/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/14e5358130b61958f1f49fd79c20b4afc9efde93","head":{"label":"Fokko:AIRFLOW-1213-add-hcatalog-parameters","ref":"AIRFLOW-1213-add-hcatalog-parameters","sha":"14e5358130b61958f1f49fd79c20b4afc9efde93","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60533353,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDUzMzM1Mw==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"Fokko/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) \r\nEnable delete and list function for Google Cloud Storage Hook\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1181\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\ncurrent `GoogleCloudStorageHook` does not support delete of a file, nor does it support listing of files based on prefix. We would like to have these features available for our use-case.\r\nThe delete function should be able to return true if successfully deleted the object, based on generation etc.\r\nThe list function should be able to list all objects with the given prefix, able to page through large result pages and return a list of all file names satisfying the given prefix criteria\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nI have tested these new features locally on a running airflow instance, with python operators calling

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1160\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nXi Wang pointed out that `--total-executor-cores` isn't supported by SparkSubmitOperator.\r\nI added the parameter `total_executor_cores` to all relevant Hooks & Operators in order to support  setting the number of executor cores with Mesos. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUpdated `test_spark_submit_hook.py` and `test_spark_submit_operator.py` to reflect this change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-1158] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1158\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWhen I try to upload a file of say 104MBs, using multipart uploads of 10MB chunks, I get 10 chunks of 10MBs and that's it. The 4MBs left over do not get uploaded.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nDoes not add new functionality.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-27T23:57:24Z","updated_at":"2017-04-28T17:27:21Z","closed_at":"2017-04-28T17:27:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"91d475ed4cc8dcd6f6548970bbfd4eaccbe051b9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2263/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2263/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2263/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/cd57a027cd70714cf5e56ed6009b0cfaaa1a4e2a","head":{"label":"MrMaksimize:fix-s3-multipart","ref":"fix-s3-multipart","sha":"cd57a027cd70714cf5e56ed6009b0cfaaa1a4e2a","user":{"login":"MrMaksimize","id":399694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/399694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize","html_url":"https://github.com/MrMaksimize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77629504,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzYyOTUwNA==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"MrMaksimize/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MrMaksimize","id":399694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/399694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize","html_url":"https://github.com/MrMaksimize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaksimize/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MrMaksimize/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1149) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1149\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nI've added a user_defined_filters argument to the DAG() constructor to be able to add custom filters to the Jinja2 templating engine. See http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/api/#writing-filters for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nI've added some new Jinja2 unit-tests, I couldn't find any existing ones.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

we're looking for the closest date before, we should take the latest date in the list of date before (instead of min asof now)\r\n\r\nDear Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issue and references it in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1145\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\nWhen using the closest_date_partition with the parameter \"before\" set to True, the function always returns the oldest date for this partition. It was caused by returning the `datetime.timedelta.min` instead of `max`. Also, `fa` and `fb` where switched.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - closest_date with before = True\r\n  - closest_date with before = False\r\n  - closest_date with before = None when answer is obvious and when there is an equality  between the target date and the dates before and after.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-492\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPreviously a failed commit into the db for the statistics\r\ncould also fail a task. Secondly, the ui could display\r\nout of date statistics.\r\n\r\nThis patch reworks DagStat so that failure to update the\r\nstatistics does not propagate. Next to that, it\r\nmake sure the ui always displays the latest statistics.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- more comprehensive unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-957\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n`DagRunOrder` now has an `execution_date` property that can be changed.\r\nAlso, by default, this `execution_date` is no longer `datetime.now()`,\r\nas it is using `execution_date` from `TriggerDagRunOperator`'s\r\ntask instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n`test_trigger_dagrun` now checks that `execution_date` is kept, and\r\nnew `test_trigger_dagrun_order_modified` checks `DagRunOrder` modifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-12T11:40:03Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T08:14:37Z","closed_at":"2018-11-06T08:14:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a00add9457e0f8503464561dc4f015159369513","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2238/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2238/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2238/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/3da73192691c593224343192faadbc9703f4bfbb","head":{"label":"calidae:master","ref":"master","sha":"3da73192691c593224343192faadbc9703f4bfbb","user":{"login":"calidae","id":19554566,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE5NTU0NTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19554566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae","html_url":"https://github.com/calidae","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":88025918,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4ODAyNTkxOA==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"calidae/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"calidae","id":19554566,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE5NTU0NTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19554566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae","html_url":"https://github.com/calidae","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calidae/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/calidae/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1094\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nRun unit tests under contrib in Travis\r\n\r\nRename all unit tests under tests/contrib to start with test_* and fix\r\nbroken unit tests so that they run for the Python 2 and 3 builds.\r\n\r\nGeneral:\r\n- Rename all tests to start with `test_*`\r\n- Remove imports in `tests/*/__init__.py`'s\r\n- Add missing packages to `requirements.txt` of CI\r\n\r\n`BigQueryHook`:\r\n- Check for JSON and not json\r\n\r\n`DataDogSensor`:\r\n- Add connection before starting unit tests\r\n\r\n`DataFlowPythonOperator`:\r\n- Use GoogleCloudBucketHelper instead of GoogleCloudStorageHook\r\n- Fix broken assert\r\n\r\n`ECSOperator`:\r\n- Replace `sys.maxint` by `sys.maxsize` for Python 3 support\r\n- Allow `startedBy` to be any argument as CI seems to run it as `'airflow'` and not `'Airflow'`\r\n- Fix checking of exceptions\r\n\r\n`SparkSubmitHook`:\r\n- Skip tests if Python 3\r\n\r\n`SqoopHook`:\r\n- Remove unneeded `OSError` (breaking in Python 3)\r\n\r\n`SSHExecuteOperator`:\r\n- Add proper mocks\r\n\r\n`Zendesk`:\r\n- Add under hooks import\r\n- Update import path of `BaseHook`\r\n- Rewrite `pytest` unit tests in `unittest`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo extra tests are added, some tests already present are fixed.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-11T18:45:08Z","updated_at":"2017-04-17T08:05:37Z","closed_at":"2017-04-17T08:05:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"30422efb8a56358c349962f05917600215cc3dfe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2234/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2234/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2234/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/4c42c4971a4d93dba6b197ddcdeac8b7259915c1","head":{"label":"hgrif:AIRFLOW-1094","ref":"AIRFLOW-1094","sha":"4c42c4971a4d93dba6b197ddcdeac8b7259915c1","user":{"login":"hgrif","id":4320866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjA4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4320866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/hgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86416041,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjQxNjA0MQ==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"hgrif/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hgrif","id":4320866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjA4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4320866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/hgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hgrif/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-351\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIf `python_callable` cannot be dumped by pickle, it causes `TypeError` by running `airflow clear DAG_ID -t TASK_ID`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport threading\r\n\r\nclass MyTask(object):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self.lock = threading.Lock()\r\n    def run(self):\r\n        pass\r\n\r\nPythonOperator(\r\n    task_id='t1',\r\n    python_callable=MyTask().run,\r\n    dag=dag)\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\n$ airflow clear mydag -t t1\r\n...\r\nTypeError: can't pickle thread.lock objects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this PR, passing a non-pickleable `python_callable` raises `AirflowException`.\r\nNote: this is an incompatible change.  A warning might be a better choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- tests.operators.python_operator.PythonOperatorTest\r\n  - test_python_operator_python_callable_is_pickleable\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-07T15:34:33Z","updated_at":"2018-12-18T04:21:34Z","closed_at":"2018-12-18T04:21:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"727c7b7299830209bbc3d7ecd0150741d7d976ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1078\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes: see http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/security/\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: Unit tests exist for the homepage. Tested this by downgrading flask and verifying that it worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

hate to do this, but I changed my mind on counting queued tasks. \r\n\r\n1. Queued tasks that are actually queued generally get set to running pretty quickly.\r\n2. Because of the worker-side check, we won't actually pass concurrency.\r\n\r\nI don't think the queued thing is a big deal because of this, I'm more worried about orphaned tasks that are in QUEUED state but not in a running dag_run (so they wont get reset) interfering with concurrency.\r\n\r\nThere may be orphaned tasks queued but not in a running dag run that\r\nwill not cleared. We should not count these as they will interfere.\r\n\r\nDear Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1074\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes: See above\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: Tests amended\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n@bolkedebruin @plypaul @artwr

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a hook to interface with Azure storage over wasb://\r\nvia azure-storage; adds sensors to check for blobs or prefixes; and\r\nadds an operator to transfer a local file to the Blob Storage.\r\n\r\nDesign is similar to that of the S3Hook in airflow.operators.S3_hook.\r\n\r\nAdded functionality for Azure Blob Storage:\r\n\r\n- `airflow.contrib.hooks.wasb_hook.WasbHook`: Interface with Azure Blob Storage.\r\n- `airflow.contrib.operators.file_to_wasb.FileToWasbOperator`: Upload a file to Azure Blob Storage.\r\n- `airflow.contrib.sensors.wasb_sensor.WasbBlobSensor`: Check if a blob is has landed.\r\n- `airflow.contrib.sensors.wasb_sensor.WasbPrefixSensor`: Check if any blobs matching a prefix have landed.\r\n\r\nThe design for the hook airflow.contrib.hooks.WasbsHook mimics airflow.operators.S3_hook.S3Hook.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- `airflow/tests/contrib/hooks/wasb_hook.py`\r\n- `airflow/tests/contrib/operators/file_to_wasb.py`\r\n- `airflow/tests/contrib/sensors/wasb_sensor.py`\r\n\r\nNote that the tests mock the `BlockBlobService` of `azure-storage`. For full automated testing the [Azure Storage Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-use-emulator) should be set up.\r\n\r\nTo test manually: \r\n\r\n- Create a Virtual Machine and Blob Block Storage on Azure.\r\n- Install and set up airflow on the Virtual Machine.\r\n- Test DAGs with a login & key (Storage Account -> Access keys).\r\n- Test DAGs with a login & SAS token (Storage Account -> Shared access signature).\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1064\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes: This changes the default sort.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: This is a UI change. Change can be verified by visiting UI. There's no real reason for a test as this behavior (old or new) doesn't really affect much.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n@amaliujia @plypaul @bolkedebruin @artwr
