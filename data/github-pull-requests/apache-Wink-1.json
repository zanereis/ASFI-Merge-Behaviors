href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf-java's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protobuf Release v3.16.3</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.16.1</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve performance characteristics of UnknownFieldSet parsing (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9371\">#9371</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.16.0</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix compiler warnings issue found in conformance_test_runner <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8189\">#8189</a> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8190\">#8190</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix MinGW-w64 build issues.
