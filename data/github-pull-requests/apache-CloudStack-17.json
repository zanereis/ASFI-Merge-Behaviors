Description\r\n\r\nUsing the VMware hypervisor with the Veeam plugin active, when restoring a VM that has been unmanaged from ACS and reimported, an error occurs because ACS duplicates the register in the database of this VM. This PR aims to fix this behavior.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a local lab:\r\n\r\n1. I created one new VM via ACS, unmanaged this VM, and then reimported this VM again to ACS;\r\n2. I added this VM to one backup offering and made one manual backup;\r\n3. I tried to restore this VM backup;\r\n4. Before ACS failed to restore the VM and duplicate the VM in the UI and database;\r\n5. ACS now completes the restore successfully, and there is no VM duplication.

This behavior has been fixed, so operations that modify the VM cannot be applied when restoring VMs.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a local lab:\r\n\r\n1. I created one VM, added this VM to one backup offering, and made one manual backup;\r\n2. I tested restoring this backup and tried to destroy the VM during this process;\r\n3. Previously, I could easily destroy the VM;\r\n4. Now, the ACS does not allow me to modify the VM.","created_at":"2023-02-15T16:39:30Z","updated_at":"2024-01-08T08:35:33Z","closed_at":"2023-04-04T06:49:21Z","merged_at":"2023-04-04T06:49:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"1e253401b0cb316764173da80164270f09570f2b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":592559219,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTI1NTkyMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:networking","name":"component:networking","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1092869943,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDkyODY5OTQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:agent","name":"component:agent","color":"80e5e2","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1152978013,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTUyOTc4MDEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:build","name":"component:build","color":"6e1ec9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3036072822,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDM2MDcyODIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:backup","name":"component:backup","color":"30F036","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4006883948,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAJTq2M7u1DJs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:storage","name":"component:storage","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/24","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/24","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/24/labels","id":7742093,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AdiKN","number":24,"title":"4.19.0.0","description":null,"creator":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":317,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-07T09:30:18Z","updated_at":"2024-06-10T07:59:27Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2024-02-02T12:49:11Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/7238/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/7238/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/7238/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/68078597f9378c9c89a81ecb045ca475bf156f1b","head":{"label":"scclouds:veeam-block-operations-in-restoring-vms","ref":"veeam-block-operations-in-restoring-vms","sha":"68078597f9378c9c89a81ecb045ca475bf156f1b","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://

Description\r\n\r\nThe usage of networks is not captured and saved by the Usage plugin, which makes it impossible to charge via the Quota plugin. The Usage plugin has been updated to record network events in the database. When a network is created, the event `EVENT_NETWORK_CREATE` is used; when a network is removed, the event `EVENT_NETWORK_DELETE` is used; and when a network is updated, the event `EVENT_NETWORK_UPDATE` is used. Also, this new type has the attributes `value.state`, `value.id` and `value.name` injected in the Quota plugin.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a local lab:\r\n\r\n1.

The Usage plugin has extended, to save the VPC events in database. When a VPC is created, the event `EVENT_VPC_CREATE` is used; when a VPC is removed, the event `EVENT_VPC_DELETE` is used.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen deploying a new VR, using a network offering with CPU cap, this limitation is not respected in the VR, because in the definition and persistence of VR in database, the configuration of CPU cap of the network offering is not considered, and always uses the value `false`. This PR aims to fix this behavior, to respect the CPU cap of the network offering.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a local lab:\r\n\r\n1.

normalized.","created_at":"2023-02-14T21:54:16Z","updated_at":"2023-03-03T13:00:01Z","closed_at":"2023-03-03T12:10:38Z","merged_at":"2023-03-03T12:10:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"ad64ee3090b3c14d7a7017bfe31ba9c90f17f48b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":589135275,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODkxMzUyNzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:usage-server","name":"component:usage-server","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2238703193,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjM4NzAzMTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/status:needs-testing","name":"status:needs-testing","color":"fc2d98","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/23/labels","id":7233557,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AbmAV","number":23,"title":"4.18.0.0","description":"released","creator":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":323,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-08T08:55:48Z","updated_at":"2024-06-10T07:59:31Z","due_on":"2023-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2023-03-15T18:50:04Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/7229/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/7229/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/7229/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/42e8800981cd146360206764a23883251e418e37","head":{"label":"scclouds:fix-wrong-usage-type-in-io-write","ref":"fix-wrong-usage-type-in-io-write","sha":"42e8800981cd146360206764a23883251e418e37","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","

Description\r\n\r\nACS has one method `(LogUtils#logGsonWithoutException)` which tries to transform one object to JSON, to write this object in the logs. If this tranformation fails, the message `error to decode` is written in DEBUG, which in some scenarios can cause a lot of useless messages. This method was refactored, and this message was changed to write only in TRACE.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a local lab:\r\n\r\n1. I performed some basic operations in VMs, like creating new VMs, destroying these VMs, migrating volumes, and so on;\r\n2.

Description\r\n\r\nUsing the VMware hypervisor, when migrating/resizing one volume, with or without IOPS limitation, and changing the disk offering, this volume keeps the configurations of IOPS of the original offering, only applying the new configurations when detaching and attaching the volume. This PR aims to fix this behavior, to apply the new IOPS configuration when migration/resizing a volume changing the disk offering.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a local lab:\r\n\r\n1. I created a new VM, and three new disk offerings, one without IOPS limitation, the second with 3000 IOPS limitation, and the third with 5000 IOPS limitation;\r\n2. I tested migrate/resize this VM volume, using all the three new disk offerings;\r\n3. Before the changes, the VM definition in vCenter did not have its IOPS configuration changed;\r\n4.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen ACS  is synchronizing the Veeam backups, if one backup fails in this process, all the other backups are skipped and ignored. This behavior is fixed by this PR; if one backup fails in syncronization, only this backup is skipped, and the others continue the process.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a local lab:\r\n\r\n1. I created two VMs, added these VMs to one backup offering, and made two manual backups;\r\n2. I renamed the backup in Veeam of one of then;\r\n3.

Description\r\n\r\nUsing the VMware hypervisor with the Veeam plugin active, when restoring a backup, ACS only verifies if the restore has finished successfully, ignoring any failure and making the user wait the timeout defined in `backup.plugin.veeam.restore.timeout`. This behavior has been fixed by this PR.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a local lab:\r\n\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen deploying a new VR, using a network offering with CPU cap, this limitation is not respected in the VR, because in the definition and persistence of VR in database, the configuration of CPU cap of the network offering is not considered, and always uses the value `false`. This PR aims to fix this behavior, to respect the CPU cap of the network offering.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a local lab:\r\n\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nUsing VMWare with Veeam on ACS, when restoring a volume from a backup, ACS creates a new VM from the backup, detaches all volumes, and attaches the selected volume to the original VM. \r\n\r\nVeeam allows restoring only the selected volume, which is faster and more performant than the current approach. This PR aims to improve the volume restore process using this native option of Veeam.\r\n\r\nAlso, when restoring and attaching one volume to one VM, the target VM needs to be stopped and then started. However, the entire process is manual; even Veeam allows the VM to be started automatically if the restore is successful. A new parameter, `startvm`, has been added to the API `restoreVolumeFromBackupAndAttachToVM`, allowing operators to specify whether or not the VM should be started automatically when volume restoration is complete.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a local lab:\r\n\r\n1. I created a new VM and attached this VM to a Backup Offering;\r\n2. I made some manual backups;\r\n3. I restore some volume of this backups, without using the parameter `startvm`, and check if, in Veeam and vCenter, only the selected volume are restored, which results in success,  but i had to start the VM manually;\r\n4.

Description\r\n\r\nThe process executed by ACS when deploying a new VM is complex, and without enough logs to identify why one component is added to avoid set. Thus, new logs were added in the process of adding a component to avoid set, and also some methods were split to sub methods, aiming to facilitate future troubleshootings, and increase legibility.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [x] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a local lab:\r\n\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nThe Quota usage value for monthly usage types uses the cost per hour to calculate the total tariff value in a particular period. In order to define the cost per hour, it takes into account the total number of hours in each month. However, this value is currently fixed at 720 hours for every month. \r\n\r\nThis causes incorrect values when calculating the cost per hour, resulting in costs being higher than expected. Therefore, this PR aims to calculate the number of hours in each month based on the actual number of days of each month.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the tariff value is 100 per month, the current cost per hour is 0.138888889 for every month. For 1 hour per month the total cost in a year would be 1.666666668.\r\nWith the adjustments to the cost per hour of this PR, the costs per hour would be: 0.134408602 (January, March, May, July, August, October, December), 0.148809524 (February of a non-leap year), 0.143678161 (February of a leap year), and 0.138888889 (April, June, September, November). This results in 1.645225294 for a non-leap year and 1.640093931 for a leap year at 1 hour per month, which is a difference of about 1.3% in costs to the current method.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn a local lab I applied the changes, and

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows CloudStack to auto-disable and auto-enable KVM hosts resource state based on customisable host/hypervisor health checks.\r\n\r\n#### Management server changes\r\n\r\nA new cluster configuration 'enable.kvm.host.auto.enable.disable' is added, disabled by default.\r\n\r\nThis PR extends the AgentManager to process StartupRoutingCommand and PingRoutingCommand with the host health check result:\r\n - If the host health check result is null, do nothing.\r\n - If the host health check result is true, enable the host resource state if it is Disabled.\r\n - If the host health check result is false, disable the host resource state if it is Enabled.\r\n\r\nOn every automatic enable or disable event, the management server will send an alert to the admin and add/update an automatic annotation (comment) on the specific host.\r\n\r\n- If a host gets auto-disabled by a health check failure, then it can be auto-enabled when the health check succeeds. But if the host gets disabled by the admin, then it must not be auto-enabled when the health check succeeds (manual host disabling takes precedence over the auto-enabling of a host).\r\n- If a host gets auto-disabled by a health check failure, the admin could enable the host but unless they also disable the health check on the host then it will just get disabled again when the health check fails\r\n\r\nCloudStack controls when a host can/cannot be auto-enabled or auto-disabled by a host detail record (on the host_details table) with key ‘autoenablekvmhost’, in the following way:\r\n- If a host is auto-enabled or auto-disabled and there is no host detail with key ‘autoenablekvmhost’ for that host, then a new host detail record is created with the key ‘autoenablekvmhost’ and is set to ‘true’. (indicating that the host can be auto-enabled/auto-disabled)\r\n- If the administrator manually disables a host and there is a host detail with key ‘autoenablekvmhost’ for that host, then the host detail ‘autoenablekvmhost’ is set to ‘false’ (indicating that the host cannot be auto-enabled if the health check succeeds)\r\n- If the administrator manually enables a host and there is a host detail with key ‘autoenablekvmhost’ for that host, then the host detail ‘autoenablekvmhost’ is set to ‘true’ (indicating that the host can be auto-disabled if the health check fails)\r\n- If the cluster setting is disabled, and the administrator enables/disables hosts in the cluster, then the host detail with key ‘autoenablekvmhost’ is not created for the hosts. (preserving the usual behavior)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### KVM host Health Check\r\n\r\nSet the path of an executable file/script for host health check on the property 'agent.health.check.script.path' on `agent.properties` \r\n\r\n- The health check result is true, if the script is executed successfully and the exit code is 0\r\n- The health check result is false, if the script is executed successfully and the exit code is 1\r\n- The health check result is null, if \r\n   - Script file is not specified, or\r\n   - Script file does not exist, or \r\n   - Script file is not accessible by the user of the cloudstack-agent process, or\r\n   - Script file is not executable\r\n   - There are errors when the script is executed (exit codes other than 0 or 1)\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n2xRocky8 KVM hosts in 1 cluster -> put host1 into maintenance, test host2\r\n- Enable the cluster setting wihout providing a health script to the host -> no automatic enable/disable\r\n- Enable the cluster setting, set a script that doesn't have permission rights -> no automatic enable/disable\r\n- Enable the cluster setting, set a script that succeeds (ping the management server) -> observe the health check result is successful, but since the host is Enabled is not transitioned to any state\r\n- Enable the cluster setting, set a script that fails (ping an unreacheable host) -> observe the health check result is false, the host2 is put into Disabled state\r\n- Enable the host2 manually -> the host2 is set to Enabled state\r\n- The next failure sets the hosts2 into Disabled state again\r\n- Modify the script again so it succeeds, the host2 goes into Enabled state, then disable manually the host2 -> the future successful health checks do not put the host into Disabled state\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-04T02:37:50Z","updated_at":"2023-04-04T11:33:38Z","closed_at":"2023-04-04T11:33:37Z","merged_at":"2023-04-04T11:33:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"be66eb2a35bd6a5aae74f97a9140a9ec01f2a838","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"GutoVeronezi","id":38945620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTQ1NjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38945620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi","html_url":"https://github.com/GutoVeronezi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584072971,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzI5NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:kvm","name":"component:kvm","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""},{"id":904051781,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MDQwNTE3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"a9b50e","default":false,"description":"Warning...

ACS the creation of tiers of a VPC is restricted to the same account that owns the VPC; therefore, each account needs to have its own VPC and it is not possible to group tiers owned by different accounts in the same VPC. These tiers cannot share the same VR that is used to implement the VPC, for instance.\r\n\r\nHowever, in private cloud scenarios to reduce the number of VRs, it might be interesting to have VPCs, where its tiers are owned by different accounts; thus, they (the accounts) share the same VR/VPC, but each one has their own broadcast domain and features implemented by the VPC, such as DHCP, NAT, and so on.\r\n\r\nTo address this situation, the concept of Domain VPCs has been created (only available on the API so far), where a VPC can be managed by a domain and its tiers can be created to accounts inside the domain. In the `createNetwork` API it will be possible to create networks (tiers) to a VPC from a different account; however, the target account must be accessible for the account that owns the VPC. The tiers will be isolated from the broadcast domain and will consume the same VR, in accordance with the current behavior. Also, if a VPN is setup in the VPC, the user will have access to all networks, in accordance with the current behavior.\r\n\r\nDocumentation:

accounts and tried creating tiers in these VPCs for the other accounts (should only be able to create if the VPC account has access to the account that owns the network). \r\n| # | VPC owner account | Network Owner account | Same Domain | Could Create | Expected Result\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |------ | ------ |\r\n| 1 | Root Admin | Any | Any | Y | Y |\r\n| 2 | Domain Admin |Any | N

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, ACS allows the creation of ACLs for VPCs; however, it is required to create an ACL per VPC. Therefore, even if multiple VPCs had the same ACL rules, it would be required to create multiple ACLs. This PR aims to change this behavior as to be able to create global ACLs which will be available to all VPCs, similar to the default ones: `default_allow` and `default_deny`.\r\n\r\nThis PR removed the requirement of the parameter `vpcId` of the `createNetworkACLList`; therefore, if there is not a VPC ID in the parameter call, then it is a global ACL. It is important to note that only root admins can manipulate these global ACLs, but anyone can use them.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI performed the following tests in a local lab:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary><h3>T0 -

Description\r\n\r\nPR #5909 was created during the release 4.17.0.0 and the parameter `since` in APIs was written as `4.17.0.0`; however, #5909 was really introduced only in 4.18.0.0.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to adjust the `since` in the introduced APIs and parameters and also:\r\n- improve the parameters documentation;\r\n- adjust parameters length, according to the field in the database;\r\n- rename parameter `UUID` of `quotaTariffDelete` to `ID`, to follow the pattern we use along other APIs;\r\n- cleanup some unused/unnecessary code in the Cmd classes;\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [X] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n###

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR normalizes ACS's loggers and upgrades log4j 1.2 to log4j 2.19. Back in 2015, PR #714 tried to normalize the loggers but, because that normalization caused some issues with the VMware module, it ended up being reverted. This PR intends to follow that PR's footsteps and normalize all of the loggers in ACS. The objective of reducing unnecessary logger declarations, and reduce the area of impact to upgrade ACS's logger framework from log4j 1.2 to log4 2.19. \r\n\r\nThe log4j upgrade was done similarly to the proposed here https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2992#issuecomment-439132311, and is more detailed ahead.\r\n\r\nThe logger normalization includes:\r\n- Classes that could have their loggers inherited from their ancestors had their own loggers deleted;\r\n- Most loggers didn't have to be static, thus most of them were normalized so that they wouldn't be;\r\n- loggers are protected now;\r\n- Static logger's names are now 'LOGGER';\r\n- Non-static logger's names are now 'logger';\r\n- New class DbUpgradeAbstractImpl created so that all Upgraders extend it and inherit its logger;\r\n- The following classes now have loggers (so that all their children can inherit their loggers):\r\n`BaseElement`, `PipelineImpl`, `AbstractRect`, `AbstractSmartLifeCycle`, `ManagedContextRunnable`, `Command`, `RuleApplier`, `VmWork`, `ModelObjectBase`, `SnapshotStrategyBase`, `VifDriver`.\r\n\r\nTo normalize all the loggers in ACS, the following steps were performed:\r\n\r\n1. The DbUpgradeAbstractImpl class was created;\r\n2. This script https://pastebin.pl/view/6ff71b26 was used to make all the Upgraders extend the DbUpgradeAbstractImpl class (I manually had to correct some of them afterward);\r\n3. I ran this script https://pastebin.pl/view/89931790 for all ACS java classes; the, I checked if classes can inherit the logger from their ancestor*; if they can, then remove their current logger instantiation. If they cannot then leave the instantiation, but make it non-static. And in some cases, rename the logger references to `logger`;\r\n4. I tried to build ACS many times and manually fixed the errors, most of them were because some loggers did indeed have to be static.\r\n\r\n*The ancestor list I created came from a previous iteration of this process, where I tried to simply remove logger instantiation from any class that extended any other class, the list was created while manually fixing the errors.\r\n\r\nFor the log4j upgrade, the following steps were performed:\r\n\r\n1. The relevant pom.xml files were updated;\r\n2. This script https://pastebin.pl/view/0b6b77f9 was used to update all the logger imports;\r\n3. I tried to build ACS many times and manually fixed the errors.\r\n\r\n**If you need to fix conflicts because of this PR, you can try using this script to help you:**\r\n- https://pastebin.com/GzMP3PCA\r\n\r\nAbout the log4j upgrade:\r\n\r\n- The DOMConfigurator does not exist in log4j2, its functionality was moved to the Configurator class;\r\n- Both NDC and MDC were merged into the ThreadContext class;\r\n\r\nDisclaimers:   \r\n- The new log4j2 configuration file format is not backwards compatible with the old one, users must update their configuration files to match with the new format. I used the official apache documentation to upgrade the default configurations, available [here](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/migration.html#Log4j2ConfigurationFormat).\r\n\r\n- If you call EncryptorCLI manually, you must also pass the log4j2 jar path (which should be in the same directory as cloud-utils).\r\n\r\nThe are still some points to address/discuss in order to make this PR ready:\r\n\r\n- ~~Refactor the following classes so that they can be used in log4j2:`SnmpTrapAppender`, `AlertsSyslogAppender`, `TestAppender`, `SnmpEnhancedPatternLayout`~~;\r\n- ~~Convert CglibThrowableRenderer functionality to log4j2;~~\r\n- The log4j 1.2 dependency could not be completely removed because juniper contrail has log4j as a dependency.\r\n- ~~Test logging for management, agent, usage, SSVMs and CPVMs~~\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [X] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI tested if both the console and the file appenders were logging correctly in the management server, agents, and system VMs.

Description\r\n\r\nPR #6577 introduced a new mechanism of validation of console sessions, which makes the access tokens one time usable in order to avoid reply attacks and prevent access to the console in case of data leak. When generating the console token, the management server (MS) that processed the request saves it in memory for further validation. When using the token, a request is sent to the CPVM that will validate it (the token) against the MS. \r\n\r\nIn an environment that has more than one MS, the CPVM will establish communication with the first available MS that it founds. In this case, if the CPVM communicates with `MS A` and the console token is generated by `MS A`, the token will work; however, if the CPVM communicates with `MS A` and the console token is generated by `MS B`, the token will not work because the token is being validated against `MS A` and the information is in the memory of `MS B`.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to handle this situation by temporally saving the console token in the database instead of saving it in the memory of the MS that generated it. This way, independently of which MS generated the token or which MS the CPVM communicates with, the token will be validated. After using the token, it is removed from the database and also from the CPVM.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38945620/212327985-5d894e1e-a7ac-4127-8c14-d437a308c2fe.png)\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI created an environment with 2 MS (A and B) and started only A. I enabled the zone in order to create the CPVM. After that, guaranting that the CPVM was communicating with MS A, I started MS B. \r\nPrevious to the changes, I executed two test cases:\r\n- generated a new console access URL (with the API `createConsoleEndpoint`) through MS A and used it. As the CPVM was communicating with MS A, it worked.\r\n- generated a new console access URL (with the API `createConsoleEndpoint`) through MS B and used it. As the CPVM was communicating with MS A, it did not worked, presenting the message `Failed to connect to server / access token has expired`\r\n\r\nWith the changes, I executed again the two test cases:\r\n- generated a new console access URL (with the API `createConsoleEndpoint`) through MS A and used it. As the CPVM was communicating with MS A, it worked.\r\n- generated a new console access URL (with the API `createConsoleEndpoint`) through MS B and used it. As the CPVM was communicating with MS A, it worked too, because the session was being stored in the database.\r\n\r\nAfter using the URLs, I checked the database and verified that there were no

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #6716\r\n\r\nIf a KVM host has been added to cloudstack environment before, then we reset agent.properties to original file (./agent/conf/agent.properties), and add the host to cloudstack again, we will face the following error:\r\n\r\n2023-01-11 20:54:03,734 DEBUG [c.c.h.k.d.LibvirtServerDiscoverer] (qtp1647766367-13:ctx-17f9aff7 ctx-47c881cb) (logid:49819f17)  can't setup agent, due to com.cloud.utils.exception.CloudRuntimeException: Failed to setup keystore on the KVM host: 10.0.32.229 - Failed to setup keystore on the KVM host: 10.0.32.229 com.cloud.utils.exception.CloudRuntimeException: Failed to setup keystore on the KVM host: 10.0.32.229\r\n        at

com.cloud.hypervisor.kvm.discoverer.LibvirtServerDiscoverer.find(LibvirtServerDiscoverer.java:320)\r\n\r\nThis is because the libvirtd has been configured to listen on LTS port when the host was added to cloudstack before. When try to add host again, cloudstack will generate a new keystore passphrase which is not same as before, and wrong password for existing keystore.\r\n\r\nThe issue can be fixed by\r\n(1) revert libvirtd config to not use TLS\r\n(2) remove all existing keystore/certificate\r\n(3) generate new keystore/certificate\r\n(4) setup agent, etc\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how

Description\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/7483\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a guest network is created, ACS allows the configuration of the firewall and port forwarding, load balancing, and VPN rules for all IPs associated with the network (including the source NAT). However, when creating a VPC, firewall configurations are possible only via ACLs; port forwarding and load balancing rules are only possible for other public IPs assigned to the network. Thus, situations, where it is necessary to combine firewall rules and port forwarding/load balancing in VPCs,  are not possible.\r\n\r\nTo work around the situation, this PR implements an extension to allow the definition of source CIDR when creating port forwarding rules. If the `cidrlist` parameter is not informed, the current behavior is maintained. This attribute will only be used when creating port forwarding rules in VPCs, since in guest networks it is possible to combine firewall and port forwarding/load balancing rules directly on the public IPs allocated to that network.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(scc) > create portforwardingrule protocol=tcp privateport=22 publicport=22 openfirewall=false vmguestip=10.1.1.248 virtualmachineid=334d4279-a0e6-4c0a-a999-37aabda08acd ipaddressid=5cca136d-5425-44fa-b6af-aafc29df269e networkid=b61abc91-ee24-4578-bae6-fa2d06cf9370 cidrlist=192.168.200.170/32\r\n{\r\n  \"portforwardingrule\": {\r\n    \"cidrlist\": \"192.168.200.170/32\",\r\n    \"fordisplay\": true,\r\n    \"id\": \"210bab98-91f3-4911-8680-5189387a7135\",\r\n    \"ipaddress\": \"172.16.200.51\",\r\n    \"ipaddressid\": \"5cca136d-5425-44fa-b6af-aafc29df269e\",\r\n    \"networkid\": \"b61abc91-ee24-4578-bae6-fa2d06cf9370\",\r\n    \"privateendport\": \"22\",\r\n    \"privateport\": \"22\",\r\n    \"protocol\": \"tcp\",\r\n    \"publicendport\": \"22\",\r\n    \"publicport\": \"22\",\r\n    \"state\": \"Active\",\r\n    \"tags\": [],\r\n    \"virtualmachinedisplayname\": \"pf-01\",\r\n    \"virtualmachineid\": \"334d4279-a0e6-4c0a-a999-37aabda08acd\",\r\n    \"virtualmachinename\": \"pf-01\",\r\n    \"vmguestip\": \"10.1.1.248\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it was observed that when removing a port forwarding rule, even if the ACS confirmed the removal of said rule, it remained active in the VR. This behavior has changed so that the rule is removed properly.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nFor testing purposes, I created a VPC: `vpc-01` and a Tier: `vpc-01-tier-01`. Using this tier three instances `PF01`, `PF02`, `PF03` was created and the port forward and ACL rules described below were created.\r\n\r\n**Firewall Rules Applied (ACL)**\r\n| Origin           | Start Port    | End Port        | Protocolo      |\r\n|------------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|\r\n| 0.0.0.0/0        | 22            | 22              | TCP (Allow)    |\r\n| 172.16.200.170/32| 23            | 23              | TCP (Allow)    |\r\n| 172.16.200.170/32| 24            | 24              | TCP (Allow)    |\r\n| 0.0.0.0/0        | -----         | -----           | ALL (Deny)     |\r\n\r\n**Port forward rules**\r\n| Private port     | Public port   | Protocol      | Source CIDR   | VM             |\r\n|------------------|---------------|---------------|---            |----------------|\r\n| 22 - 22          | 22 - 22       | TCP           | ---           | PF01           |\r\n| 22 - 22          | 23 - 23       | TCP           | ---           | PF02           |\r\n| 22 - 22          | 24 - 24       | TCP           | ---           | PF03           |\r\n\r\nThis way, after applying the ACL rule that authorizes access to port `22` from any IP (`0.0.0.0/0`); access to other instances (`PF02` and `PF03`) turns out to be exposed. After applying the port forward rule limiting access to a list of CIDRs, the observed result was that access to the resources/services of instances `PF02` and `PF03` was limited to the CIDR informed when creating the port forward rule\r\n\r\n**Regras de port forward**\r\n| Private port     | Public port   | Protocol      | Source CIDR   | VM             |\r\n|------------------|---------------|---------------|---            |----------------|\r\n| 22 -

Description\r\n\r\nThe ACS default rules for read-only accounts (Read-Only Admin - Default and Read-Only User - Default) do not allow accounts created with these rules to execute the `quotaStatement`
