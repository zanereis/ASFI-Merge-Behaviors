to this PR, the return type for `CodeGenC` was hard-coded as part of `virtual CodeGenC::PrintFuncPrefix`, regardless of the return type specified in the `PrimFunc`.  This PR updates `CodeGenC` to use `PrimFuncNode::ret_type` for the return type in the generated C code.\r\n\r\nThis change should have no effect on observable behavior, while allowing the forward declaration of external functions to be improved.  The majority of codegen classes specified a `void` return type, which matches the default `DataType::Void()` for a `PrimFunc`.  The one exception is `CodeGenCHost::PrintFuncPrefix`, which specified an `int32_t` return type, matching the `DataType::Int(32)` used for the functions generated by `MakePackedAPI` and

PR improves the optimization of clip in simplify expr pass.\r\nPreviously, there is a SimplifyCastClip class, it deals with the pattern \"cast->clip\": it checks if the a_min/a_max values of clip equals the min/max values of the data type of cast OP.\r\nThis PR improve SimplifyCastClip in 2 aspects:\r\n\r\n1. In the original code, it is restricted that the OP before \"clip\" is a \"cast\" OP. This restriction is not necessary, and is relaxed.\r\n2. In the original code,  CheckDataTypeMaxMinValue checks if the a_min/a_max values of clip equals the min/max values of dtype. I relax this to check \"a_max >= dtype.max and a_min <= dtype.min\". Also, I add the case of bfloat16 in CheckDataTypeMaxMinValue.\r\n\r\nSince the new optimization of \"clip\" does not rely on \"cast\" op, the name is changed to

PR fixed two bugs in Conv2DTranspose and Conv3DTranspose. Both of them are caused by lacking the parsing of the `output_padding` attribute.\r\nIn addition, corresponding test cases were added to capture the bug.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n```\r\nimport tvm\r\nimport tvm.relay as relay\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom tensorflow import keras\r\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers, models\r\ninput_shape = (2, 33,33,128)\r\ninput_data = np.random.random(size=input_shape)\r\nx = layers.Input(shape=input_shape[1:], dtype='float32')\r\n\r\nkwargs={'filters':2,'kernel_size':[3, 3],'strides':[2, 2],'output_padding':[1, 1],}# 'data_format':\"channels_last\"} \r\n# output_padding lead to this bug\r\nlayer = keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose(**kwargs)\r\nlayer.set_weights(layer.get_weights())\r\n\r\ny = layer(x)\r\nmodel = models.Model(x, y)\r\nmodel.summary()\r\nres_keras = model(input_data)\r\n\r\nshape_dict = {'input_1': input_shape}\r\nmod, params = relay.frontend.from_keras(model, shape_dict,layout='NHWC')\r\nwith tvm.transform.PassContext(opt_level=3):\r\n    model = relay.build_module.create_executor(\"graph\", mod, tvm.cpu(0), 'llvm', params).evaluate()\r\n\r\ntest_x_tvm = input_data\r\nres_tvm = model(tvm.nd.array(test_x_tvm.astype('float32'))).numpy()\r\n\r\nnp.testing.assert_allclose(res_keras, res_tvm, atol=1e-3, rtol=1e-3)\r\n```\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/tvm/assets/29506758/4820cc33-98b5-4453-8667-6333153eaee4)\r\n\r\nBTW, The Conv3DTranspose has a similar bug. The following keras layer can trigger it:\r\n```\r\nkeras_mod.layers.Conv3DTranspose(\r\n                filters=2, kernel_size=(3, 3, 3), strides=(2, 2, 2), output_padding=(1, 1, 1)\r\n            ),\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @echuraev @Hzfengsy @masahi

form the fact that textures can be allocated over a clBuffer object and the size of backing clBuffer can be computed based on hardware image pitch alignment.\r\n\r\nThis optimizes the overall memory allocation on device and helps greately the models with large memory requirements.\r\n\r\nImprovised the graph memory planner to not differentiate buffer and texture storage tokens and reuse them across. The texture pool in OpenCL runtime is rebranded as memory pool that handles allocation for both buffer and image objects.\r\n\r\nNDArray to DeviceAPI interface is extended with AllocDataSpaceView and FreeDataSpaceView.

to this commit, the PrimFunc generated by `bb.call_te` had no struct info associated with it.

to this commit, use of `nn.Placeholder` or `nn.Parameter` outside of a `with block_builder.function('name'):` scope resulted in an error.  This commit updates the behavior to allow declaration prior to entering the `with` block.  This can be useful for declaring a model object, which is then used to define several related functions.\r\n\r\nThe scope was required so that `relax.BlockBuilder.current()` could de-duplicate variable names.  While two distinct variables in Relax may have identical names, for user readability it is convenient to have all names be unique within a Relax function.  This commit maintains the de-duplication of names if a `nn.Placeholder` or `nn.Parameter` is defined within an active `relax.BlockBuilder`, that context may be used to provide a unique name.","created_at":"2023-06-05T17:35:26Z","updated_at":"2023-06-09T13:06:35Z","closed_at":"2023-06-09T05:03:16Z","merged_at":"2023-06-09T05:03:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"0328e98b940adb970185ce97f015e924b640ba09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15025/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15025/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15025/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/e9c0ba9b2ff101be346bd7695eb2818d3faf8d95","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_nn_placeholder_before_bb_function","ref":"relax_nn_placeholder_before_bb_function","sha":"e9c0ba9b2ff101be346bd7695eb2818d3faf8d95","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

the number of output channels is less than 4, then we cannot pack such convolution to textures, although we can repack and extend tensors from 4d to 5d in runtime.\r\n\r\nIt is happened because function `PropBoundToInputs` is invoked for all stages in when InferBound pass or LowerSchedule function is called.\r\n\r\n`PropBoundToInputs` has a logic in it that helps to developer to avoid out of bound access. And based on the output shape, it propagates it to inputs.\r\n\r\nImagine that we want to transform a 4d tensor with 3 channels to 5d, extend its number of channels to 4 and then transform it back to 4d tensor with number of channels equal to 3. Example below:\r\n```\r\n[1, 3, 6, 6] -> [1, 1, 6, 6, 4] -> [1, 3, 6, 6]\r\n```\r\nIn this case, we might write a boundary check in the repacking and extending compute function to handle the case when the iterator by the channels is out of bounds for the intermediate tensor.\r\n\r\nTo avoid such problem, `PropBoundToInputs` has a logic which propagates a bounds from output tensor to input. In case when it is a possible situation that the compute has out of bounds access, then the range is decreased to value when such situation cannot be achieved. That means that for the example above the loop by channels which should filling intermediate tensor will iterate in range [0, 2] instead of [0, 3].\r\n\r\nAs it was mentioned, to avoid such problem we use buffers and cuda schedules instead of textures for cases when number of output channels is less than 4 and we cannot pack such tensor to texture. I evaluated performance of such approach and it doesn't introduce any performance degradation. For such small convolutions performance with buffers even a bit better than with textures.","created_at":"2023-05-31T12:47:01Z","updated_at":"2023-06-01T06:29:42Z","closed_at":"2023-06-01T05:45:39Z","merged_at":"2023-06-01T05:45:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"9da026194f3220a76c1e0be6ab53d477133fde0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14996/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14996/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14996/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/0f3a4232a3daadb5dcd53c7b97ca2b7d9be35b5d","head":{"label":"echuraev:echuraev/fix_adreno_conv2d_with_3_channels","ref":"echuraev/fix_adreno_conv2d_with_3_channels","sha":"0f3a4232a3daadb5dcd53c7b97ca2b7d9be35b5d","user":{"login":"echuraev","id":5525113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjUxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5525113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev","html_url":"https://github.com/echuraev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":317515420,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTc1MTU0MjA=","name":"tvm","full_name":"echuraev/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"echuraev","id":5525113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjUxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5525113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev","html_url":"https://github.com/echuraev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/echuraev/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the `RequiresPackedAPI` function checked whether a function needed the packed func API.  This was used both to generate a list of call-sites to update, and as part of the updates to `PrimFunc` signatures.  However, the function that updates the `PrimFunc` signature could still return the original function unmodified, breaking internal method calls.  This occurred for functions with a `kTarget` attribute without a host.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `MakePackedAPI` to first update all `PrimFunc` signatures that require the packed func API, then use the result to determine which call-sites must be updated.  This resolves the discrepancy for host-less target annotations, and removes the possibility of similar discrepancies in the future.","created_at":"2023-05-30T18:35:12Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T15:27:38Z","closed_at":"2024-09-11T15:27:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"44d188d91bbce2dcc78fc8ba839b19ef071ba242","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14989/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14989/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14989/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c5f095611f94df39dc7443210a2042c59ddfb924","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:make_packed_api_cleanup","ref":"make_packed_api_cleanup","sha":"c5f095611f94df39dc7443210a2042c59ddfb924","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, any caller that uses a different `Target` than its callee is lowered to a device-kernel launch.  However, if the caller and callee are on the same device, despite using a different target (e.g. `Target(\"llvm\")` and `Target(\"c\")` both use `kDLCPU`), then the kernel launch is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `LowerDeviceKernelLaunch` to produce a kernel launch only when the callee is on another device, and to produce `T.call_extern` for callees on the same device.","created_at":"2023-05-30T18:17:06Z","updated_at":"2023-06-04T13:32:25Z","closed_at":"2023-06-04T08:46:56Z","merged_at":"2023-06-04T08:46:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"9877db5ff3cd88f4320919eb0f07a3d02c2f4f6f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14988/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14988/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14988/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/922df815b441eb5cb08efee9bcacde2516da0ead","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:callee_on_same_device_different_codegen","ref":"callee_on_same_device_different_codegen","sha":"922df815b441eb5cb08efee9bcacde2516da0ead","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, a build that used multiple targets needed to provide `tvm::build` with a `Map<Target, IRModule>` specifying which target should be used to compile each `IRModule`.  As a result, lowering passes could not introduce new targets based on a PrimFunc's content (e.g. a `with T.target()` frame to delegate out to another device), nor simplify based on cross-device subroutines (e.g. simplify a host-side conditional based on the known output of a device-side internal subroutine).\r\n\r\nThis commit makes the `tvm::attr::kTarget` attribute (`\"target\"`) be the single source of truth for where a `PrimFunc` will be executed. Other existing methods for specifying the target (the `target` parameter for `tvm.build`, the keys in a `Map<Target,IRModule>`, the parameter to the pass `tir::transform::BindTarget`) are still

resolves an issue introduced by the combination of https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14918 and\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14945.  The bug occurred for targets that do not require device-side codegen, but do require a `device_type` other than `kDLCPU`.  It wasn't caught by CI, as the issue only occurred with the combination of both PRs.\r\n\r\n1. #14918 updated `SplitHostDevice` to only modify the `\"target\"` attribute when a device-side function has been extracted.\r\n\r\n2. For VTA, there is no device-side function, as everything is done through host-side API calls.\r\n\r\n3. From (1) and (2), the VTA examples kept the target `T.target(\"ext_dev\", host=\"llvm\")` after the `SplitHostDevice` pass, instead of being updated to `T.target(\"llvm\")`.\r\n\r\n4. #14945 restricted CombineContextCall to only apply to host-side passes.\r\n\r\n5. From (4) and (5), the `CombineContextCall` pass was no longer applied to the VTA context calls.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes `SplitHostDevice`, updating the target from `T.target(\"ext_dev\", host=\"llvm\")` to `T.target(\"llvm\")`, even if no device sections have been extracted from the function.","created_at":"2023-05-30T14:21:09Z","updated_at":"2023-05-30T20:43:25Z","closed_at":"2023-05-30T20:43:22Z","merged_at":"2023-05-30T20:43:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"7131411f0a212cbcf8c16547e4b633001cba469e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14982/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14982/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14982/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/4fdf1d157e30bfd36ae60d7be03cabba218cf3de","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:bugfix_split_host_device","ref":"bugfix_split_host_device","sha":"4fdf1d157e30bfd36ae60d7be03cabba218cf3de","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

`CombineParallelMatmul` eagerly combines all parallel branches it finds. Sometimes, it is desirable to ignore certain patterns based on, for example, the number of matmuls.  \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a user-defined \"check function\" to `CombineParallelMatmul` that is used like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nVar inp;\r\nArray<Var> rhs, bias;\r\nMap<Var, Expr> bindings; // Passed from DF rewriter\r\n\r\nif (!check(inp, rhs, bias, bindings)) {\r\n  continue;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt also modifies the signature of the DF binding rewrite function to additionally pass the current bindings (`Map<Var, Expr>`). This can be useful for querying the attributes of the matched `CallNode` expressions. Until now, only matched `Var`s (`Map<DFPattern, Var>`) are being passed, so there has been no way to retrieve the corresponding matched expressions. \r\n\r\n@vinx13 @yelite @jwfromm

python dependency missing problem has been reported in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14244, the same code was merged before, but strangely, the relevant changes were reverted in the latest commit. @areusch\r\n\r\nBut it can be confirmed that typing_extensions is still needed by tvmc at least: [source code of tvm.meta_shedule.builder.builder](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/python/tvm/meta_schedule/builder/builder.py#L21)\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that this problem affects the [tvm source code download page](https://tvm.apache.org/download), at least version 0.12.0. In fact, I encountered the **ModuleNotFoundError** error when installing tvm from source code and trying to **call tvmc**. You can reproduce this error with the following command:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# download, compile and install.\r\nwget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tvm/tvm-v0.12.0/apache-tvm-src-v0.12.0.tar.gz \\\r\n    && tar -zxvf apache-tvm-src-v0.12.0.tar.gz \\\r\n    && mkdir -p apache-tvm-src-v0.12.0/build \\\r\n    && cd apache-tvm-src-v0.12.0/build/ \\\r\n    && cp ../cmake/config.cmake ./ \\\r\n    && sed -i

non-void.","created_at":"2023-05-25T20:29:33Z","updated_at":"2023-05-30T02:15:31Z","closed_at":"2023-05-26T12:23:18Z","merged_at":"2023-05-26T12:23:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"1aeb34af33777a0fdb566c41c61e01d1871fa4b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14958/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14958/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14958/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/4641884f373b01af0509eb0bd418f0af3f608d5e","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:codegen_llvm_packedfunc_returning_void","ref":"codegen_llvm_packedfunc_returning_void","sha":"4641884f373b01af0509eb0bd418f0af3f608d5e","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open
