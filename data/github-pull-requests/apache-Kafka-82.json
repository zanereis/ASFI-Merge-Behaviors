PR adds the capability of users to create delegation token to other users.\r\n\r\nKIP-373: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-373%3A+Allow+users+to+create+delegation+tokens+for+other+users\r\n\r\nIn this use case, a superuser with username ‘superuser’ wants to run kafka clients on behalf of a user 'joe'. The 'superuser' has secure authentication credentials (kerberos, SSL, SCRAM) but user 'joe' doesn’t have any. The clients are required to run as user 'joe' and authorizations are required to be done as user 'joe.' In this case, 'superuser' can get a delegation token for user 'joe', and use the generated token to run the Kafka clients. This will mimic the impersonation functionality. This will help the stream processing frameworks/libs (Apache Spark, Storm, Kafka Streams) to run the jobs (Kafka clients) as submitted users.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10803 is opened to increase default session timeout to 45 seconds, I reverted my previous change to use default session timeout setting. Thanks.\r\n\r\n===============\r\nIncrease session timeout to 30 secs to make the test reliable.\r\n\r\nI had a PR, to duplicate multiple `KTableKTableForeignKeyInnerJoinMultiIntegrationTest` tests and duplicate another `KTableKTableForeignKeyInnerJoinMultiIntegrationTest` tests to increase the session timeout to 30 seconds as comparison. After 3 runs, I found all 30 seconds tests passed, but the original 20 seconds session timeout failed sometimes. That's why this PR to increase session timeout to 30 seconds is created.\r\n\r\nBut, there's also 1 more thing I noticed. Not sure if it's a bug or not. \r\n\r\nWe have this declared:\r\n```\r\ntable1.join(table2, tableOneKeyExtractor, joiner, materialized)\r\n            .join(table3, joinedTableKeyExtractor, joinerTwo, materializedTwo)\r\n            .toStream()\r\n            .to(OUTPUT,\r\n                Produced.with(serdeScope.decorateSerde(Serdes.Integer(), streamsConfig, true),\r\n                              serdeScope.decorateSerde(Serdes.String(), streamsConfig, false)));\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I think (and checked the code), we should run `tableOneKeyExtractor` first, then `joiner`, and then `joinedTableKeyExtractor` if we needed, then `joinerTwo`.\r\nBut in the failed case: \r\n```\r\nDid not receive all 1 records from topic output- within 60000 ms\r\n```\r\nI found we got all 4 data and entered `tableOneKeyExtractor`\r\n```\r\n<during rebalancing...>\r\ntableOneKeyExtractor:-1\r\ntableOneKeyExtractor:2\r\ntableOneKeyExtractor:-2\r\ntableOneKeyExtractor:1\r\n<all streams are running>\r\njoiner: value1 2.22,20\r\njoinedTableKeyExtractor:value1=2.22,value2=20\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected result (run from my local env)\r\n```\r\ntableOneKeyExtractor:1\r\ntableOneKeyExtractor:2\r\ntableOneKeyExtractor:-1\r\ntableOneKeyExtractor:-2\r\njoiner: value1 1.33,10\r\njoiner: value1 2.22,20\r\njoinedTableKeyExtractor:value1=1.33,value2=10\r\njoinedTableKeyExtractor:value1=2.22,value2=20\r\njoiner2: value1 value1=1.33,value2=10,waffle\r\n```\r\nYou can notice the `joiner: value1 1.33,10` doesn't get run in the failed case, and that's why the following `joinedTableKeyExtractor` and `joiner2` not run. Do you have any thought about that? I'm thinking it might because the 3 streams are still under rebalancing, so the streaming processing might get terminated if the stream drop suddenly. And that's why the data lost. Do you think it's possible? Any thought about it?\r\n\r\nYou can check this jenkins log [here](https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Kafka/job/kafka-pr/job/PR-10773/2/testReport/junit/org.apache.kafka.streams.integration/KTableKTableForeignKeyInnerJoinMultiIntegration132Test/Build___JDK_15_and_Scala_2_13___shouldInnerJoinMultiPartitionQueryable/) (search \"standard error\"). Some keywords are: \r\n`starting` is starting 3 streams\r\n`all running` is that 3 streams reach running state\r\n`tableOneKeyExtractor`, `joinedTableKeyExtractor`, `joiner2` should be clear\r\n`value1` is `joiner`\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

This wasn't really the intended point of that PR, so rather than do a retroactive KIP, let's just reverse the renaming.","created_at":"2021-05-17T16:40:20Z","updated_at":"2021-05-18T19:59:21Z","closed_at":"2021-05-18T19:59:21Z","merged_at":"2021-05-18T19:59:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"3a42baa260d4e39b82843d5458b56c1c4026abf7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10713/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10713/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10713/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/c79a60fd413c29e2a2a228c4421c2a76d67c3d32","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:HOTFIX-revert-TopologyDescription-Subtopology-renaming","ref":"HOTFIX-revert-TopologyDescription-Subtopology-renaming","sha":"c79a60fd413c29e2a2a228c4421c2a76d67c3d32","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

the network configuration of a source cluster which is taking part in a replication flow is changed (change of port number, if, for instance TLS is enabled or disabled) MirrorMaker2 won't update its internal configuration even after a reconfiguration followed by a restart.\r\n\r\nWhat happens in MirrorMaker2 after a cluster \"identity\" (i.e. connectivity config) changes:\r\n\r\n1. MM2 driver (MirrorMaker class) starts up with the new config.\r\n2. DistributedHerder joins a dedicated consumer group that decides which driver instance has control over the assignments and the configuration topic.\r\n3. The driver caches the consumer group assignment, which indicates that it is the leader of the group.\r\n4. The driver reads the configuration topic (which is still not containing the new config), and starts the mm connectors.\r\n5. Since the old config is invalid, the connectors cannot connect to the cluster anymore - MirrorSourceConnector tries to query the cluster through the admin client, but the queries time out after 2 minutes (it contains 2 tasks affecting the source cluster, the timeout is 1 minute for both).\r\nIn the meantime, the background heartbeat thread checks on the state of the herder consumer membership. There is a default rebalance timeout of 1 minute. Since the herder thread was blocked due to the connector query timeouts, it wasn't able to call poll on the consumer. Heartbeat thread invalidates the consumer membership and triggers a new consumer creation.\r\n6. The herder thread finishes the connector startup, and after realizing that the configuration has changed, tries to update the config topic.\r\n\r\nThe config topic can only be updated by the leader herder.\r\nThe driver checks the group assignment to see if it is the leader.\r\nIn the local cache, the old assignment is present, in which the leader is the previous consumer with its own ID.\r\nThe current consumer ID of the driver does not match the cached leader ID.\r\n\r\n7. The driver refuses to update the config topic.\r\n\r\n**The proposed fix for this:**\r\nThe rebalance issue can be fixed by decreasing the time that we wait for tasks that affects the source cluster at the start of MM2. By decreasing the timeout (from 1 minute to 15 seconds by default), if the kafka config is old, the tasks affecting the source cluster won't block for too long. With this the herder will be able to update the config topic. This timout is configurable now and defaults to 15 seconds.\r\n\r\nAlso needed to increase the number of threads in the scheduler so that other tasks won't be blocked.\r\n\r\n**Testing done:**\r\n\r\n-  configure replication between source->target\r\n-  checked that the replication is working\r\n-  change source kafka cluster broker port\r\n-  restart kafka/mirrormaker2, produced new messages in the replicated topic\r\n-  after the restart mm2 was trying to use the old kafka configs, and even after a long time, it couldn't replicate. After applying the fix, the issue was solved, replication worked.\r\n\r\nAlso tested with the same scenario, but instead of changing the port, ssl was turned on the source kafka cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-17T13:13:07Z","updated_at":"2025-01-02T03:36:12Z","closed_at":"2025-01-02T03:36:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

last two lines in the commit in that link.\r\n\r\nThis does not cause problems for the generator, because Jackson will ignore trailing input by default.\r\n\r\nHowever, some JSON parsers cannot be configured to ignore trailing characters, and so they fail on that file. This can cause problems for users wishing to use the official schema definitions to generate clients in other languages.\r\n\r\nThe fix here is pretty simple - just remove the trailing tokens, and optionally configure jackson to fail on trailing tokens. This patch is for the former, and I'll be happy to submit a patch that configures jackson so this won't happen again :).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

all brokers from the logic of the server side, just as followed\r\n\r\n>   def handleTopicMetadataRequest(request: RequestChannel.Request): Unit = {\r\n    ...\r\n    val brokers =

This comments was first introduced in KAFKA-642 (e11447650a). which means meta request only need brokers related to the topics we want.\r\n2. KAFKA-1535 (commitId: 4ebcdfd51f) changed the server side logic. which has the metadata response contain all alive brokers rather than just the ones needed for the given topics.\r\n3. However, this comments are retained till now.\r\nSo According to my understanding, this comments looks like a stale one and can be

patch adds support for running the ZooKeeper-based kafka.security.authorizer.AclAuthorizer with KRaft clusters. Set the authorizer.class.name config as well as the zookeeper.connect config while also setting the typical KRaft configs (node.id, process.roles, etc.), and the cluster will use KRaft for metadata and ZooKeeper for ACL storage. A system test that exercises the authorizer is included.\r\n\r\nThis patch also changes \"Raft\" to \"KRaft\" in several system test files. It also fixes a bug where system test admin clients were unable to connect to a cluster with broker credentials via the SSL security protocol when the broker was using that for inter-broker communication and SASL for client communication.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Ron Dagostino

than using multiple optional class members to determine if we are in ZK or KRaft mode, use inheritance. The factory method in AutoTopicCreationManager now makes the decision about which mode we're in and provides only the needed dependencies to the concrete classes (i.e., no optionals).\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nobject AutoTopicCreationManager {\r\n  def apply(\r\n    config: KafkaConfig,\r\n    channelManager: BrokerToControllerChannelManager,\r\n    metadataSupport: MetadataSupport,\r\n    groupCoordinator: GroupCoordinator,\r\n    txnCoordinator: TransactionCoordinator,\r\n  ): AutoTopicCreationManager = {\r\n    metadataSupport match {\r\n      case zk: ZkSupport => new ZkAutoTopicCreationManager(config, zk, groupCoordinator, txnCoordinator)\r\n      case _: RaftSupport => new DefaultAutoTopicCreationManager(config, channelManager, groupCoordinator, txnCoordinator)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also adds some error handling to the response handler when running in KRaft mode

for a Kafka cluster in a system test is cached due to https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8917, but we mutate the security config during some system tests, and those mutations were not being passed through after-the-fact.  These system tests were not testing what they were supposed to be testing.  This patch passes through the potential changes so that we again test what we are supposed to be testing.\r\n\r\nAlso, since we became very specific about what SASL mechanisms to enable when updating the system tests for KRaft, we need to explicitly indicate to the SecurityConfig any additional SASL mechanisms that we want to enable.  This was always necessary once we made the KRaft changes, but it was not apparent due to the above bug (where mutations were not being passed through).  This patch provides a way to pass additional SASL mechanisms to the SecurityConfig by adding an optional `sasl_mechanism` to KafkaListener -- this is what gets passed into the SecurityConfig when we enable a new security protocol in the middle of a system test.\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix.

PR moves the existing `TaskId` class to the `internals` package, and has it implement a new `TaskId` interface which just exposes the metadata fields.

Summary\r\n\r\n`ReassignPartitionsCommand` does _not_ check whether the replication factor of a partition is the same as the existing replication factor, which may result that different partitions of a topic have different numbers of replicas.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, I attempted a fix to `ReassignPartitionsCommand` within https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1779, but now I think it should be fixed on the broker side.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nBesides the integration test I have changed, I built a 3-node Kafka cluster on my laptop with Docker containers and ran a few shell scripts to test.\r\n\r\nCreate a topic\r\n```\r\nbin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:29092 --create --topic test-reassign-partitions --partitions 3 --replication-factor 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nreassignment-plan.json\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"version\":1,\r\n   \"partitions\":[\r\n      {\r\n         \"topic\": \"test-reassign-partitions\",\r\n         \"partition\": 0,\r\n         \"replicas\" :[1, 2]\r\n      }\r\n   ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute a partition reassignment\r\n```\r\nbin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:29092 --reassignment-json-file reassignment-plan.json --execute\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output is\r\n```\r\nCurrent partition replica assignment\r\n\r\n{\"version\":1,\"partitions\":[{\"topic\":\"test-reassign-partitions\",\"partition\":0,\"replicas\":[2,1,0],\"log_dirs\":[\"any\",\"any\",\"any\"]}]}\r\n\r\nSave this to use as the --reassignment-json-file option during rollback\r\nError reassigning partition(s):\r\ntest-reassign-partitions-0: Replica assignment on test-reassign-partitions-0: [1, 2] violates its replication factor\r\n```","created_at":"2021-05-13T08:21:27Z","updated_at":"2025-01-01T03:42:42Z","closed_at":"2025-01-01T03:42:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chia7712","id":6234750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzQ3NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6234750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712","html_url":"https://github.com/chia7712","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"huxihx","id":11549429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQ5NDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11549429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx","html_url":"https://github.com/huxihx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

In `Log.collectAbortedTransactions()` I've restored a previously used logic, such that it would handle the case where the starting segment could be null. This was the case [previously](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/8205051e90e3ea16165f8dc1f5c81af744bb1b9a/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/Log.scala#L1658-L1661), but the PR https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10401 accidentally [changed the behavior](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/Log.scala#L1240-L1243) causing the code to assume that the starting segment won't be null.\r\n2. In `Log.rebuildProducerState()` I've removed usage of the `allSegments` local variable. The logic looks a bit simpler after I removed it.\r\n3. I've introduced a new `LogSegments.higherSegments()` API. This is now used to make the logic a bit more readable in `Log. collectAbortedTransactions()` and `Log.deletableSegments()` APIs.\r\n4. I've removed the unnecessary use of `java.lang.Long` in `LogSegments` class' segments map definition.\r\n5. I've converted a few `LogSegments` API from public to private, as they need not be public.\r\n\r\n**Tests:**\r\nRelying on existing unit tests.","created_at":"2021-05-13T00:51:52Z","updated_at":"2021-05-27T15:56:01Z","closed_at":"2021-05-27T15:56:01Z","merged_at":"2021-05-27T15:56:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"3fb836f507d35e2a1ab39df57edca671ffc66073","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10684/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10684/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10684/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/7a84aa15a943d72ea5e100af4d7406fca4d23fc6","head":{"label":"kowshik:MINOR_improve_Log_layer_in_AK_a_bit","ref":"MINOR_improve_Log_layer_in_AK_a_bit","sha":"7a84aa15a943d72ea5e100af4d7406fca4d23fc6","user":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":239427959,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk0Mjc5NTk=","name":"kafka","full_name":"kowshik/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik/kafka","description":"Mirror

Conditions or full repetitions within a test method may produce a false test outcome. Once a condition is not met, and the code block inside the condition is not executed, a false 'passed' outcome can be produced without the test ever being executed.\r\n(2) A test method with many individual assertions stops being executed on the first failed assertion, which prevents the remaining ones' execution. The difference between these assertions lies in different arguments only.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nParameterized tests make it possible to run a test multiple times with different arguments. Using JUnit's parameterized tests feature instead of a repetition structure enables the repeated block to function as an independent test. This way, we could make the original tests become as many independent ones as there are versions to be tested. In this refactoring, no original assertion parameter was changed.\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-12T23:31:32Z","updated_at":"2025-01-01T03:42:40Z","closed_at":"2025-01-01T03:42:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

(reverted https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10405). https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10405 has several issues, for example:\r\n- It fails to create a topic with 9000 partitions.\r\n- It flushes in several unnecessary places.\r\n- If multiple segments of the same partition are flushed at roughly the same time, we may end up doing multiple unnecessary flushes: the logic of handling the flush in LogSegments.scala is weird.\r\n\r\nKafka does not call fsync() on the directory when a new log segment is created and flushed to disk.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that following sequence of calls doesn't guarantee file durability:\r\n\r\nfd = open(\"log\", O_RDWR | O_CREATE); // suppose open creates \"log\"\r\nwrite(fd);\r\nfsync(fd);\r\n\r\nIf the system crashes after fsync() but before the parent directory has been flushed to disk, the log file can disappear.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to flush the directory when flush() is called for the first time.\r\n\r\nDid performance test which shows this PR has a minimal performance impact on Kafka clusters.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-12T20:00:45Z","updated_at":"2021-05-14T16:25:25Z","closed_at":"2021-05-14T16:25:25Z","merged_at":"2021-05-14T16:25:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"db3e5e2c0de367ffcfe4078359d6d208ba722581","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10680/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10680/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10680/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/2b760a204c5846adc7138c0bf599efb4d9550b9b","head":{"label":"ccding:fsync-fix","ref":"fsync-fix","sha":"2b760a204c5846adc7138c0bf599efb4d9550b9b","user":{"login":"ccding","id":1221778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjE3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1221778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccding","html_url":"https://github.com/ccding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccding/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"13ffebe2f1012da473189c4fe86fd14b83809962","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":2211243,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjExMjQz","name":"kafka","full_name":"apache/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka","description":"Mirror

`Worker` class has an `executor` field that the public constructor initializes with a new cached thread pool

does not shutdown this executor. This is normally okay in the Connect runtime and MirrorMaker 2 runtimes, because the worker is stopped only when the JVM is stopped (via the shutdown hook in the herders).\r\n\r\nHowever, we instantiate and stop the herder many times in our integration tests, and this means we're not necessarily shutting down the herder's executor. Normally this won't hurt, as long as all of the runnables that the executor threads run actually do terminate. But it's possible those threads might not terminate in all tests.\r\n\r\n@kkonstantine can you review this? many thanks!\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

the existing `Subtopology` class + interface to `SubtopologyDescription`, since that more closely matches what it is/is used for. Then introduces a new `Subtopology` class which includes basic metadata such as the topic group id and the NamedTopology that this subtopology belongs to, if any.\r\n\r\nAlso adds an internal `NamedTaskId` class to expose the `namedTopology` of a TaskId outside the package. I realized TaskId is part of the public API, so we can't just add a public `namedTopology()` getter method. I made the `namedTopology` field protected and removed the getter/moved it to the NamedTaskId class.\r\n\r\nThere are no actual logical changes or features in this PR, it's just a refactoring.

 Not meant to be merged.  Related to https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/9957 \r\n\r\n@romani please note that I intentionally fine-grained this PR to a few commits (with appropriate messages, I hope you will find them useful). Rationale: my intention was to dissect important parts bit-by-bit (let me know in case you want me to change something). \r\n\r\n**_Notable temporary changes:_**\r\n- checkstyle gradle `maxError` property is introduced (just for counting error counting purposes)\r\n- module `Indentation` is disable via checkstyle.xml (in this contex those errors are not relevant)\r\n\r\n**_How to execute CheckStyle gradle tasks:_**  ` ./gradlew checkstyleMain checkstyleTest` \r\nhttps://github.com/dejan2609/kafka/blob/apache-kafka-with-checkstyle-8.42/README.md#running-code-quality-checks\r\n\r\n**_CheckStyle gradle configuration / config files:_** \r\n- https://github.com/dejan2609/kafka/blob/apache-kafka-with-checkstyle-8.42/build.gradle#L588\r\n- https://github.com/dejan2609/kafka/blob/apache-kafka-with-checkstyle-8.42/build.gradle#L712\r\n-

https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/blob/4.2.3/CHANGELOG.md~~\r\n\r\nRationale: \r\n* Checktyle 8.20 is two years old; also, both Gradle 6.8 and 7.0 are using recent Checkstyle version (8.37)\r\n* Checkstyle 8.36.2 is geared towards recent Java versions (see 8.36 release notes: https://checkstyle.org/releasenotes.html#Release_8.36)\r\n* Checkstyle version 8.42 should be skipped (lots of false positives, see here: https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/9957)\r\n* more recent Checkstyle versions (i.e. 8.37 and above) are imposing more strict indentation rules and hence we can opt to:\r\n  * relax Checkstyle indentation rules **_OR_**\r\n  *  comply with these new rules and change affected classes (note: total of 50 violations in 18 classes is recorded when compiled with Checkstyle 8.41.1)\r\n \r\n\r\n@ijuma Please review this. \r\nAlso, let me know what do you prefer: to merge this commit or wait for a full upgrade to a latest checkstyle version ? And in case that you opt for the latter: which strategy do you prefer (i.e. are we going to relax checkstyle rules or comply with them)

active/passive, one-way replication without renaming topics, similar to MM1. This implementation is described in KIP-382 (adopted), originally as \"LegacyReplicationPolicy\".\r\n\r\nThis enables operators to migrate from MM1 to MM2 without re-architecting their replication flows, and enables some additional use-cases for MM2. For example, operators may wish to \"upgrade\" their Kafka clusters by mirroring everything to a completely new cluster. Such a migration would have been difficult with either MM1 or MM2 previously.\r\n\r\nWhen using IdentityReplicationPolicy, operators should be aware that MM2 will not be able to detect cycles among replicated topics. A misconfigured topology may result in replicating the same records back-and-forth or in an infinite loop. However, we don't prevent this behavior, as some use-cases involve filtering records (via SMTs) to prevent cycles.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes major contributions from @mdedetrich and @ivanyu, so please include them in the commit

am taking over the PR of https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9395 which has been rebased to work with the latest `trunk` of Kafka. As stated in the original PR, it adds a `IdentityReplicationPolicy` for MirrorMaker2 (known as `LegacyReplicationPolicy`) which imitates the behavior of MirrorMaker1 (i.e. it doesn't rename the the topics apart from `heartbeat`). The behavior of this PR is exactly the same as the stated original.\r\n\r\nHere are some additional notes/changes that are different from the original PR.\r\n* An additional constructor for the `startClusters()` has been added which allows you to supply test specific MirrorMaker configs. This allows the `IdentityReplicationPolicy` tests to use as much more code from the base `MirrorConnectorsIntegrationBaseTest`, heavily reducing boilerplate when compared to the original PR. Although It can be argued that you can just do `.put` directly on the `mm2Props` `HashMap`, this method is cleaner and more importantly better handles the case where you need to override an existing key (since `super` needs to be called last in `startClusters` it will override any existing keys which you may have configured in your own test)\r\n* Certain methods/fields of `MirrorConnectorsIntegrationBaseTest` have been changed from `private` to `protected` so that `IdentityReplicationPolicy` specific tests can access them.\r\n\r\n@ryannedolan You reviewed the original PR and in that PR you stated that a KIP is needed since we are adding a public method to the `ReplicationPolicy` interface, is this still necessary? You also had issues with the `canTrackSource` method name, do you have a better alternative?\r\n\r\n## Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n* [ ] Verify design and implementation\r\n* [X] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n* [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n\r\nEDIT: Renamed `LegacyReplicationPolicy` to

Create a consumer that consumes from the topic\r\n```./kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server $SOURCE --group myConsumer --topic myTopic```\r\n3. Send 100 messages to the topic. These should get consumed by the consumer. Offset for this consumer on source cluster should be 100.\r\n```for i in $(seq 1 100); do echo $i; done | ./kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server $SOURCE --topic myTopic```\r\n4. Wait until the retention policy deletes the records\r\n5. Start MM2 with `source->target.sync.group.offsets.enabled = true`\r\n6. Observe on the target cluster that log-end-offset is 0, offset is 100, and lag is -100.\r\n```./kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server $TARGET --describe --group
