PR contains the following changes:\r\n* Changing `PAssert.java` code to use Metrics instead of Aggregators\r\n* Changing `TestSparkRunner.java` code to use Metrics. The change here also required adding up different Metrics counters because Metrics are per-step; while Aggregators in Spark seem to be adding accross steps.\r\n\r\nAdditional bug fixes/code improvements:\r\n* Fixing a bug in `MetricFiltering`\r\n* Changing the Spark runner to use `MetricFiltering` instead of its own filtering implementation - if that's okay : )\r\n\r\n* I ran `mvn clean verify` successfully.\r\n\r\nAre there other places where I should be porting Aggregators checks to Metrics?\r\n\r\n@aviemzur @tgroh

@aaltay @davorbonaci \r\n\r\nIn examples/java/README, I separated and created a section for each runner so it's easy for other runners to add their commands also. Please verify I didn't mess up the command lines when doing that, as I'm not familiar with the bundling. Long term, I am wondering if most of the README content would be better off in the Word Count walkthrough on the website? as it's similar to what's there already, and then we can use tabs for Java/Python and the different runners.

However, `BigtableIO` uses classes that are defined in the `Bigtable` libraries, so we would have to force our version on users. \r\n\r\n@davorbonaci @aviemzur

This PR was created to have a convenient environment for discussing this code. Here are the TODOS:**\r\n\r\n- windows after applying the transform do not contain the right number of elements. They only contain the elements that were output when batchSize was reached and not the ones that are left in the window if batchSize < windowSize. These remaining elements are supposed to be output when the window ends thanks to a timer that fires at window.maxTimestamp + allowedLateness. Elements are added to a bagState but this bagState turns out to be empty when the timer fires. Maybe, as the states are scoped per window, and the window is different (end of fixedWindow passing to GlobalWindow), then another bagState instance gets injected. Hence the empty bagState? \r\n\r\n- Test of the inner BatchingDoFn is ignored because DoFnTester is not supported by DirectRunner yet.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-09T10:21:43Z","updated_at":"2017-06-14T09:05:52Z","closed_at":"2017-04-04T16:30:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da4321ac6348306d972aa294b6a36a61d1bdbffb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/2211/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/2211/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2211/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/5fb6b0b641e792275e5c9ff95795631f7d7cb655","head":{"label":"echauchot:BEAM-135-BATCHING-PARDO","ref":"BEAM-135-BATCHING-PARDO","sha":"5fb6b0b641e792275e5c9ff95795631f7d7cb655","user":{"login":"echauchot","id":8821084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjEwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot","html_url":"https://github.com/echauchot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":68310413,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2ODMxMDQxMw==","name":"beam","full_name":"echauchot/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"echauchot","id":8821084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjEwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot","html_url":"https://github.com/echauchot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/echauchot/beam","description":"Mirror

None).\r\n```python:apache_beam/transforms/display.py\r\n    if self.key is None:\r\n      raise ValueError('Invalid DisplayDataItem.
