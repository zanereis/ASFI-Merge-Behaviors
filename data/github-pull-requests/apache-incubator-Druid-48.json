Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThis is a small but valuable change that augments the existing jetty logger instruction to present the HTTP response code.\r\nThis is extremely helpful to calculate the SR (Success Rate) based on the percentage of non-http-5xx requests, which powers SLO/SLA definitions and alerting (with a log indexing / metrics scrapping/exporting mechanism).\r\n\r\nPlease provide some handholding around testing: e.g., what is the best way to compile & dockerize this change so I can test this in my k8s cluster?\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n *

Description\r\n\r\nSeveral changes to better support extension services:\r\n\r\n* Use Guice to publish the list of known node roles so an extension can add to it.\r\n* Use the Guice list in for SQL servers system table so it will publish instances of the extension service.\r\n* Split out the index task client into a base class to allow the client to be used for an extension service.\r\n* Add a PrivateApi annotation to mark REST services primarily used internally to the server.\r\n* Misc. code cleanup.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n\r\n * `NodeRoles` - A Guice multi-binder to hold the list of Druid- and extension-defined node roles.\r\n * `PrivateAPI` - Annotation to use to mark a REST service which is private to a server rather than being public. Such private APIs should not be documented.\r\n * `TaskClient` - Holds most of what was in `IndexTaskClient`, but without the tight binding to the indexer. `IndexTaskClient` now extends `TaskClient` and adds the Indexer-specific assumptions.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] been tested via the Maven build and the tests run in Github.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-04T03:22:39Z","updated_at":"2022-02-02T02:13:03Z","closed_at":"2022-02-02T02:13:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b93e983557c0324f891df9d5324a9835a23d9649","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":698268891,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTgyNjg4OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Extension","name":"Area

the number of times a timestamp is parsed and read if the row is a transformed row.\r\n\r\nDuring ingestion the parsing and appending functionality requires repeated access to the timestamp information from the row. In the case of a TransformedInputRow, this could be an expensive step:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n  \"name\": \"__time\",\r\n  \"expression\": \"(point_seconds * 1000.0) + (point_nanos / 1000000.0)\"\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy caching this row, a significant reduction in CPU time can be achieved, in this example from 14% to 4% of CPU involved in reading Timestamps, a 10% reduction. This change converts the processing from lazy load of timestamp during Transform to an eager transform, and then keeps the result.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3196528/147988949-ed26c604-2c8a-478e-be13-9a476eff70b7.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3196528/147988927-922f14f5-2e97-4f0e-a105-8b0fe79e8912.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] N/A using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nFollowing from #12105 with 1-20% CPU in `DimensionDictionary`, there are some improvements to be made to the `add()` path on the `StringDimensionIndexer`.\r\n\r\nThere are three sub-changes:\r\n\r\n#### Introduce a new benchmark\r\n\r\n`StringDimensionIndexerProcessBenchmark` in cff7a6caaab2d28218ab01655c44d24e99c40e0c covers the `StringDimensionIndexer` `processRowValsToUnsortedEncodedKeyComponent` for throughput.\r\n\r\n#### Optimise `StringDimensionIndexer` -> `DimensionDictionary` boundary\r\n\r\nin 400f0a5137264d9c4f0a88dc346b6730458b1b09 introduce an `AddResult` class to combine the result of both (a) what is the index of the result, and (b) was the result a new addition or refers to a previous element.\r\n\r\nThis results in a ~30% improvement on this codepath single threaded, and ~70%  by bypassing multiple `size()` calls to determine whether the dictionary has changed.\r\n\r\n#### Switch lock implementation in `DimensionDictionary` to `StampedLock`\r\n\r\nIn aea89f5c502317b69957fbf592d84e4e9ee3f9a5 introduce improved concurrency under multiple-reader scenarios, and scenarios where `add()` of existing elements. Results in 3x improvement in contended situation.\r\n\r\n#### Refactor\r\n\r\nSlight refactor in 3e5c410047a74b3cae8044070260384803a2e1e5 to simplify flow in `StringDimensionIndexer`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the items which are not done or not relevant to the PR. None of the items from the checklist below are strictly necessary, but it would be very helpful if you at least self-review the PR. -->\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster. -> nb: partly, have not tested `StampedLock` in prod\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-31T02:59:53Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T16:46:42Z","closed_at":"2023-01-25T23:49:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"25a079828f9e2ffafede95141ed099b3972fd538","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":120288359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAyODgzNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":648734860,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NDg3MzQ4NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Segment%20Format%20and%20Ser/De","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nIf large number of values are required from `DimensionDictionary` during indexing, fetch them all in a single lock/unlock call instead of lock/unlock each individual item.\r\n\r\nDuring indexing there are repeated lock/unlock boundary crossing. In a sample application (57 fields to index), this consumes ~9% of the taskrunner CPU.\r\n\r\nDepending on indexing row configuration specifics, the indexer usage of `DimensionDictionary` can consume anywhere from 1-20% of the CPU time during processing. This PR addresses one aspect of the processing, specifically the getValues. (I'll introduce another PR on the add/size change).\r\n\r\n#### Introduce a `getValuesInto()` call to the `DimensionDictionary`, and use it\r\n\r\nThis introduces a `getValuesInto` call, which accepts an array of IDs to fetch, and performs the equivalent of many `getValue()` calls.\r\n\r\n#### Expand benchmarks to cover wider rows and some concurrency\r\n\r\n### Design option\r\n\r\nThere is one other design option, that is in fact much faster again, but is a bit less intuitive.\r\n\r\nHere are the benchmark results across all three:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsingle getValue()\r\nBenchmark                                                                  (cardinality)  (rowSize)  Mode  Cnt  Score    Error  Units\r\nStringDimensionIndexerBenchmark.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSize                    10000          8  avgt   10  0.046 ±  0.001  us/op\r\nStringDimensionIndexerBenchmark.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSize                    10000         40  avgt   10  0.215 ±  0.007  us/op\r\nStringDimensionIndexerBenchmark.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSizeTwoThreads          10000          8  avgt   10  3.484 ±  0.032  us/op\r\nStringDimensionIndexerBenchmark.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSizeTwoThreads          10000         40  avgt   10  8.638 ±  0.514  us/op\r\n\r\nbulk getValuesInto() <----- THIS SOLUTION\r\nBenchmark                                                                  (cardinality)  (rowSize)  Mode  Cnt  Score    Error  Units\r\nStringDimensionIndexerBenchmark.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSize                    10000          8  avgt   10  0.039 ±  0.001  us/op\r\nStringDimensionIndexerBenchmark.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSize                    10000         40  avgt   10  0.120 ±  0.002  us/op\r\nStringDimensionIndexerBenchmark.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSizeTwoThreads          10000          8  avgt   10  0.383 ±  0.052  us/op\r\nStringDimensionIndexerBenchmark.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSizeTwoThreads          10000         40  avgt   10  0.386 ±  0.018  us/op\r\n\r\nusing doInsideReadLock() <----- ALTERNATIVE, FASTER BUT LESS CLEAN\r\nBenchmark                                                                  (cardinality)  (rowSize)  Mode  Cnt  Score    Error  Units\r\nStringDimensionIndexerBenchmark.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSize                    10000          8  avgt   10  0.018 ±  0.001  us/op\r\nStringDimensionIndexerBenchmark.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSize                    10000         40  avgt   10  0.077 ±  0.002  us/op\r\nStringDimensionIndexerBenchmark.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSizeTwoThreads          10000          8  avgt   10  0.241 ±  0.004  us/op\r\nStringDimensionIndexerBenchmark.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSizeTwoThreads          10000         40  avgt   10  0.486 ±  0.002  us/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives (faster!)\r\n\r\nThe alternative, `doInsideReadLoop()` is to pass a lambda / closure into the `DimensionDictionary` boundary and have it perform locking and execute on the other side. This is likely to be faster for most cases, however, it's a bit less clear in the API (I'll leave an extra comment).\r\n\r\nThe solution involves similar changes, and passing a closure across the boundary. However, it does leak implementation concerns...\r\n\r\n```\r\n/************ DimensionDictionary.java **************/\r\npublic void doInsideReadLock(BiConsumer<List<T>, Integer> fn)\r\n{\r\n  lock.readLock().lock();\r\n  try {\r\n    fn.accept(idToValue, idForNull);\r\n  }\r\n  finally {\r\n    lock.readLock().unlock();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n/************ StringDimensionIndexer.java **************/\r\n@Override\r\npublic long estimateEncodedKeyComponentSize(int[] key)\r\n{\r\n  int[] estimatedSize = new int[]{key.length * Integer.BYTES};\r\n  dimLookup.doInsideReadLock((List<String> idToValue, Integer idForNull) -> {\r\n    for (int id : key) {\r\n      if (id != idForNull) {\r\n          String val = idToValue.get(id);\r\n          int sizeOfString = 28 + 16 + (2 * val.length());\r\n          estimatedSize[0] += sizeOfString;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n  return estimatedSize[0];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I think the changes are straightforward!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nIntroduce a back-off to the `HttpPostEmitter` `send()` thread loop to minimise the amount of log spamming and CPU.\r\n\r\nFixes #11279.\r\n\r\n#### Introduce HttpPostEmitterLoggerStressTest\r\n\r\nIntroduce a test to count how many logged events are triggered during a loop scenario. It confirms that no more than some maximum send timeout log events are written in duration of the test. Test runs typically for 6 seconds, and expects limit of 1000 send attempts in that 6 second period.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the HttpPostEmitter thread submits 150K events in the test window.\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR] org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.HttpPostEmitterLoggerStressTest.testBurstFollowedByQuietPeriod(org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.HttpPostEmitterLoggerStressTest)\r\n[ERROR]   Run 1: HttpPostEmitterLoggerStressTest.testBurstFollowedByQuietPeriod:98 too many timeouts (159620), expect less than (1000)\r\n[ERROR]   Run 2: HttpPostEmitterLoggerStressTest.testBurstFollowedByQuietPeriod:98 too many timeouts (166201), expect less than (1000)\r\n[ERROR]   Run 3: HttpPostEmitterLoggerStressTest.testBurstFollowedByQuietPeriod:98 too many timeouts (173177), expect less than (1000)\r\n[ERROR]   Run 4: HttpPostEmitterLoggerStressTest.testBurstFollowedByQuietPeriod:98 too many timeouts (175135), expect less than (1000)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Introduce a backoff to the send() loop when the specific timeout is experienced.\r\n\r\nA simple backoff is chosen at 1/5th the minimum time.\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution which might be better involves a larger rewrite of this class, as the class currently splits responsibilities for managing the batching and sending across multiple classes and threads. A simpler codebase might run a simpler submission loop with a more explicit throttle and batching mechanism instead of the current batching handoffs.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] N/A using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nImproves the stability of Overlord and all tasks in a cluster when there are large (1000+) task counts, by reducing contention between the management thread and the reception of status updates from the cluster.\r\n\r\n#### Introduce GuardedBy to TaskQueue\r\n\r\n.. and fix some existing missed spots.\r\n\r\n#### Introduce TaskQueueScaleTest\r\n\r\nTo test scalability of starting and stopping 1000 tasks (set with a 60sec timeout), that currently fails and is fixed in the next commit.\r\n\r\n#### Reduce TaskQueue contention\r\n\r\nReduce the duration of holding the `giant` critical lock, which increases responsiveness:\r\n- Break apart the TaskQueue-Manager manage loop to a critical (locked) section and a section that can be run concurrently with notifications (ie: sending any necessary shutdown requests).\r\n  - This is the most important part of the change, since in the existing code the blocking shutdown requests are performed inside the loop. By moving the blocking calls outside the loop we make it possible for status notifications to be promptly processed.\r\n- Minimise duration that notifyStatus calls take holding the giant lock.\r\n- Move other logging etc outside the critical section where possible.\r\n\r\n### Design decisions\r\n\r\nI chose a BlockingQueue implementation because it is easy to reason about the submission / poll / offer ordering. Other options would be Semaphore etc.\r\n\r\nThere is potential future work:\r\n- Current behaviour, if a task `shutdown()` call is slow it slows down submission of tasks across the whole loop - this is not improved by the PR.\r\n- This could be mitigated by introducing an Executor, or by applying a decision that shutdown() call implementations are non-blocking.\r\n- If recommended, I'd suggest we do this as a separate PR.\r\n\r\nThis follows the mailing list discussions here:\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread/9jgdwrodwsfcg98so6kzfhdmn95gzyrj\r\n\r\nh/t @gianm for the rebase + test case.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nImprove the performance of `TaskQueue::manage` on large installations by removing unnecessary String concat / construction.\r\n\r\nOnce the changes in #12096 are applied, the performance of the `TaskQueue` loop becomes much tighter, and is dominated by the logging calls.\r\n\r\nScreenshot of profiler showing `TaskQueue-Mana...` thread:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3196528/147293850-fce1bff4-9205-4a45-9f1f-44b09a1612f5.png)\r\n\r\nScreenshot of profile flamegraph for this thread, highlighting the `format` calls in the stack:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3196528/147293905-2ddeeede-4bf8-4619-be89-224c69c08ab4.png)\r\n\r\nDuring the task clean up loop, the `shutdown()` call is issued multiple times to the `RemoteTaskRunner` - note especially it uses the three-argument invocation of `shutdown()` method:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/476d0bf4be4199e97695bd568d165cda98523d37/indexing-service/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/indexing/overlord/TaskQueue.java#L328-L335\r\n\r\nThis hits the default implementation, which constructs a \"reason\" argument and passes it on to the two-argument `shutdown()`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/476d0bf4be4199e97695bd568d165cda98523d37/indexing-service/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/indexing/overlord/TaskRunner.java#L91-L94\r\n\r\nIn particular on large clusters with thousands of tasks, this `default void shutdown` call performs a `StringUtils.format` on a task set with thousands of task IDs, and it serialises all of them to a String.\r\n\r\nEven in the event this log line is turned off, the log is still constructed, and then discarded.\r\n\r\n### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n\r\nThis introduces an `@Override public void shutdown()` with arguments, and has it perform the log construction and issue only if the info level is enabled. This results in significantly lower CPU consumption in this loop.\r\n\r\nThis follows up the changes in #12096, and also follows the mailing list discussion here:\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread/9jgdwrodwsfcg98so6kzfhdmn95gzyrj\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster (as part of a larger block of

Description\r\n\r\nImprove the performance of `RemoteTaskRunner::tryAssignTask` which consumes long periods of CPU on the Overlord during a task restart operation.\r\n\r\nScreenshot of profiler

Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n\r\nThis change:\r\n1. eliminates triple nested call of `getRunningTasks()` in `ZkWorker::toImmutable`, and,\r\n2. reduces the work performed in `ZkWorker::isRunningTask` by parsing only the `id` field instead of the entire ZkWorker json.\r\n\r\nBy eliminating this extra work, the loop is much tighter.\r\n\r\nThis is a change coupled to this

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, our integration test uses maven to pull in dependencies for some extensions instead of Druid's extension loading system. The discrepancy in how Druid loads extension dependencies between in production and in integration tests makes our integration tests less trust-able especially when it comes to class loading. This PR fixes it to use Druid's extension system for every extension. \r\n\r\nThis PR also cleans up a bit how integration test configuration system works. \r\n\r\n- Before this PR, some integration tests use a fixed loadList that is set in `setupData` in `druid.sh`. This loadList is not overrideable which is confusing and also hard to debug. This PR removes the fixed loadList.\r\n- `docker-compose.override-env.yml` is deleted. Every docker-compose file should support override-configs now.\r\n- An empty `override.config.path` is allowed now. `environment-configs/empty-config` will be used in that case.\r\n- This PR also removes unnecessary docker compose settings for `custom-coordinator-duties` and `shuffle-deep-store` groups. The docker compose setting should be used only when the test group requires extra nodes besides the default nodes defined in `docker-compose.yml`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `copy_resources_template.sh`\r\n * `druid.sh`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

a bug because of which some SQL queries cannot be parsed using druid convention. Specifically, these queries translate to an inline datasource and have some null values. Calcite internally uses NULL as SQL type for these literals and that is not supported by the druid. ~In this PR, we are marking such null literals as the STRING column type.~\r\n\r\nUpdate - Instead of checking for null type, I am now allowing null column types to be returned while building RowSignature in `org.apache.druid.sql.calcite.table.RowSignatures#fromRelDataType`. RowSignature already allows null column type for any column. Doing so should also fix bindable queries such as `select (1,2)`. When such queries are run with `headers` set to true, we get an exception in `org.apache.druid.sql.http.ArrayWriter#writeHeader`. This is again a similar exception to the one addressed in this PR. Because SQL type for the result column is `RECORD` and that doesn't have a corresponding columnType. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

This PR also upgrades the [Ace editor](https://ace.c9.io/) (the main code editor for all the JSONs and SQLs). This is done by upgrading to the latest version or `react-ace` which in turn changes how the Ace editor itself is imported from using `brace` to using `ace-builds` (see the [readme of react-ace](https://github.com/securingsincity/react-ace) for more details on why).\r\n\r\nNew Diff

from `brace` to `ace-builds` which generates a large number of dependent package and license changes\r\n- Updated to new ReactAce and went everywhere updating the APIs (there are many changes on the JS and the CSS endpoints)\r\n- Normalized the capitalization and spelling of all the `describe` labels\r\n- Pulled out all the Ace editor styles into a single file `ace.scss`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n-

PR adjusts `SchemaRegistryBasedAvroBytesDecoder` to throw `ParseException` instead of `RE` when failure to retrieve a schema occurs. \r\n\r\nThrowing an `RE` can be problematic when this decoder is used in streaming ingestion: if a corrupt record enters the stream with an invalid schema ID, the user cannot easily recover from this as the streaming ingestion tasks will continue to fail and attempt to read the corrupt record.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

For eg:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"queryType\": \"groupBy\",\r\n  \"dataSource\": \"test\",\r\n  \"intervals\": [\r\n    \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z/3000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"granularity\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"all\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"virtualColumns\" : [ {\r\n    \"type\" : \"expression\",\r\n    \"name\" : \"v0\",\r\n    \"expression\" : \"mv_to_array(\\\"tags\\\")\",\r\n    \"outputType\" : \"ARRAY<STRING>\"\r\n  } ],\r\n  \"dimensions\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"default\",\r\n      \"dimension\": \"v0\",\r\n      \"outputName\": \"tags\"\r\n      \"outputType\":\"ARRAY<STRING>\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"aggregations\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"count\",\r\n      \"name\": \"count\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwill return with the following results \r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n {\r\n    \"timestamp\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\r\n    \"event\": {\r\n      \"count\": 1,\r\n      \"tags\": \"[]\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"timestamp\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\r\n    \"event\": {\r\n      \"count\": 1,\r\n      \"tags\": \"[\"t1\",\"t2\",\"t3\"]\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"timestamp\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\r\n    \"event\": {\r\n      \"count\": 1,\r\n      \"tags\": \"[t3\",\"t4\",\"t5\"]\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"timestamp\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\r\n    \"event\": {\r\n      \"count\": 2,\r\n      \"tags\": \"[\"t5\",\"t6\",\"t7\"]\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo activate this behavior in SQL we use a new `mv_to_array` which takes in a multiValue/String column. \r\n\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect mv_to_array[tags] , count(*) from inline_data group by 1\r\n```\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

With this PR, we have removed the coercion and arrays are being passed as arrays to the native layer.\r\n\r\nThe idea was to copy concepts from how `DictionaryBuildingStringGroupByColumnSelectorStrategy` generated int<-> List<T> on the fly. \r\nSome optimizations are done for Array[String] while generating the dictionary keeping in mind that we want to store each string only once on the heap and reference that with the integer. As we are dealing with arrays, we are referencing the indexed array with yet another int so that the least amount of heap is used when string cardinality is low. \r\nSo if we have 2 rows:\r\n```\r\n [a,b]\r\n [b,c]\r\n```\r\nthe global dictionary would look like this:\r\n```\r\n\"a\"<>1\r\n\"b\"<>2\r\n\"c\"<>3\r\n```\r\nand the corresponding arrays would look like\r\n``` \r\n[1,2]<>1\r\n[2,3]<>2 \r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso the inMemory structures needed to implement `comparable` and would be called per row. Hence `ComparableStringArrays`, `ComparableIntArrays` are coded in such a way that they don't have the overhead of `Lists` and `Integers`. \r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ComparableStringArray.java`\r\n * `ComparableIntArray.java`\r\n * `ResultRowDeserializer.java`\r\n * `RowBasedGrouperHelper.java`\r\n * `ArrayConstructorOperatorConversion.java`\r\n * `ArrayStringGroupByColumnSelectorStrategy.java`\r\n * `ListGroupByColumnSelectorStrategy.java`\r\n * `ComparableList.java`\r\n * `Calcites.java`\r\n * `Function.java`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nTo enable the legacy behavior, for whatever reason, one can set a runtime property  \r\n`-Ddruid.expressions.processArraysAsMultiValueStrings=true` while starting the broker. \r\n \r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

#12022  \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of memory estimation in `OnHeapIncrementalIndex`:\r\n- uses `guessAggregatorHeapFootprint()` to calculate the max memory an metric aggregator can use\r\n- multiplies the above value by the number of aggregators (same as number of aggregated rows or number of unique row keys)\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation of `StringDimensionIndexer`\r\n- encodes dimension values and calculates size of encoded values as well as original dimension values every time, irrespective of whether the dimension values are already added to the dictionary\r\n\r\nBecause of the above, the memory usage tends to be over-estimated which leads to more persistence cycles than necessary.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the max estimation mechanism with getting the actual incremental memory used by the aggregator or indexer at each invocation of `aggregate` or `encode` respectively.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Add new flag `useMaxMemoryEstimates` in the task context. This overrides the same flag in DefaultTaskConfig i.e. `druid.indexer.task.default.context` map\r\n- `useMaxMemoryEstimates = true`(default value) denotes the current method of estimation\r\n- Add method `AggregatorFactory.factorizeWithSize()` that returns an `AggregatorAndSize` which contains\r\n  - the `Aggregator` instance\r\n  - initial size in bytes of the aggregator\r\n- Add method `Aggregator.aggregateWithSize()`\r\n  - returns a long representing the incremental memory used by this aggregation\r\n  - default implementation calls `aggregate()` and returns 0\r\n- Remove method `DimensionIndexer.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSize()`\r\n- Update the method `DimensionIndexer.processRowValsToKeyComponent()` to return `EncodedKeyComponent<EncodedType>` which contains:\r\n    - `EncodedType keyComponent`: e.g. int[] for StringDimensionIndexer, Long for LongDimensionIndexer\r\n    - `long effectiveSizeBytes`: Effective size of the key component.\r\n- Update `OnHeapIncrementalIndex` to use the new estimations only if `useMaxMemoryEstimates = false`\r\n- Update `Aggregator` impls\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-15T15:45:51Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:34:50Z","closed_at":"2022-02-03T05:04:03Z","merged_at":"2022-02-03T05:04:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"e648b01afba52ee5b980d28b16b636e346a86819","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":222509152,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjI1MDkxNTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Operations","name":"Area

intermediate results pool for broker cannot be converted to a dummy pool and it is being used by group by queries and also by group by on lookups in the broker. We have introduced a separate BrokerProcessingModule for broker which initializes the intermediate results pool by default to 0.

Note that pool can create more buffers if necessary.\r\n\r\nThis decouples the pool usage by the broker for the intermediate results pool from the DruidProcessingModule which is used by historicals as well.\r\n\r\nThe checkin is verified on a local druid cluster and integration tests pass locally\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nFixes the problem mentioned in #10147 by @clintropolis that peon process's log is output to middle manager's log file.\r\n\r\nCurrently all Druid processes share the same log4j2 configuration file located in `_common` directory. Since peon processes are spawned by middle manager process, they derivate the environment variables from the middle manager. These variables include those in the `log4j2.xml` controlling to which file the logger writes the log.\r\n\r\nBut current task logging mechanism requires the peon processes to output the log to console so that the middle manager can redirect the console output to a file and upload this file to task log storage.\r\n\r\nSo, this PR imposes this requirement to peon processes, **whatever the configuration is in the shared log4j2.xml, peon processes always write the log to console**.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * added `ConsoleLoggingEnforcementConfigurationFactory.java`, to enfore `ConsoleAppender` is used\r\n * updated `ForkingTaskRunner.java`, to pass a `-Dlog4j2.configurationFactory` argument to peon\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nAfter applying this patch, we can see from the middle manager's log that under file appender configuration, the task long won't output to the middle manager's log file, and the middle manager starts the peon with the newly added jvm parameter `-Dlog4j2.configurationFactory`.\r\n\r\n```text\r\n2021-12-18T08:58:49,726 INFO [WorkerTaskManager-NoticeHandler] org.apache.druid.indexing.worker.WorkerTaskManager - Task[index_parallel_wikipedia_klcfmdop_2021-12-18T08:58:49.704Z] started.\r\n2021-12-18T08:58:49,727 INFO [forking-task-runner-1] org.apache.druid.indexing.overlord.ForkingTaskRunner - Running command: java -cp ... -Dlog4j2.configurationFactory=org.apache.druid.indexing.common.tasklogs.ConsoleLoggingEnforcementConfigurationFactory org.apache.druid.cli.Main internal peon var/druid/task/index_parallel_wikipedia_klcfmdop_2021-12-18T08:58:49.704Z/task.json var/druid/task/index_parallel_wikipedia_klcfmdop_2021-12-18T08:58:49.704Z/ff580551-d0f6-4da7-bdb9-c88cdc110d76/status.json var/druid/task/index_parallel_wikipedia_klcfmdop_2021-12-18T08:58:49.704Z/ff580551-d0f6-4da7-bdb9-c88cdc110d76/report.json\r\n2021-12-18T08:58:49,736 INFO [forking-task-runner-1] org.apache.druid.indexing.overlord.ForkingTaskRunner - Logging task index_parallel_wikipedia_klcfmdop_2021-12-18T08:58:49.704Z output to: var/druid/task/index_parallel_wikipedia_klcfmdop_2021-12-18T08:58:49.704Z/log\r\n2021-12-18T08:58:59,417 INFO [forking-task-runner-1] org.apache.druid.indexing.common.tasklogs.FileTaskLogs - Wrote task log to: var/druid/indexing-logs/index_parallel_wikipedia_klcfmdop_2021-12-18T08:58:49.704Z.log\r\n2021-12-18T08:58:59,418 INFO [forking-task-runner-1] org.apache.druid.indexing.common.tasklogs.FileTaskLogs - Wrote task report to: var/druid/indexing-logs/index_parallel_wikipedia_klcfmdop_2021-12-18T08:58:49.704Z.report.json\r\n2021-12-18T08:58:59,418 INFO [forking-task-runner-1] org.apache.druid.indexing.overlord.ForkingTaskRunner - Process exited successfully for task: index_parallel_wikipedia_klcfmdop_2021-12-18T08:58:49.704Z\r\n2021-12-18T08:58:59,424 INFO [forking-task-runner-1] org.apache.druid.indexing.overlord.ForkingTaskRunner - Removing task directory: var/druid/task/index_parallel_wikipedia_klcfmdop_2021-12-18T08:58:49.704Z\r\n2021-12-18T08:58:59,427 INFO [WorkerTaskManager-NoticeHandler] org.apache.druid.indexing.worker.WorkerTaskManager - Task [index_parallel_wikipedia_klcfmdop_2021-12-18T08:58:49.704Z] completed with status [SUCCESS].\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nRelated to #11188 \r\n\r\nThe above mentioned PR allowed timeseries queries to return a default result, when queries of type: `select count(*) from table where dim1=\"_not_present_dim_\"` were executed. Before the PR, it returned no row, after the PR, it would return a row with value of `count(*)` as 0 (as expected by SQL standards of different dbs).\r\n\r\nIn `Grouping#applyProject`, we can sometimes perform optimization of a groupBy query to a timeseries query if possible (when the keys of the groupBy are constants, as generated by automated tools). For example, in `select count(*) from table where dim1=\"_present_dim_\" group by \"dummy_key\"`, the groupBy clause can be removed. However, in the case when the filter doesn't return anything, i.e. `select count(*) from table where dim1=\"_not_present_dim_\" group by \"dummy_key\"`, the behavior of general databases would be to return nothing, while druid (due to above change) returns an empty row. This PR aims to fix this divergence of behavior.\r\n\r\nExample cases:\r\n1. `select count(*) from table where dim1=\"_not_present_dim_\" group by \"dummy_key\"`.\r\n_CURRENT_: Returns a row with count(*) = 0\r\n_EXPECTED_: Return no row\r\n\r\n2. `select 'A', dim1 from foo where m1 = 123123 and dim1 = '_not_present_again_' group by dim1`\r\n_CURRENT_: Returns a row with ('A', 'wat')\r\n_EXPECTED_: Return no row\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo do this, a boolean `droppedDimensionsWhileApplyingProject` has been added to `Grouping` which is true whenever we make changes to the original shape with optimization. Hence if a timeseries query has a grouping with this set to true, we set `skipEmptyBuckets=true` in the query context (i.e. donot return any row).\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `Grouping.java`\r\n * `DruidQuery#toTimeseriesQuery`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

overlapping segment intervals in auto compaction\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes two problems when Druid compact overlapping segment intervals via auto compaction.\r\nImagine we have a segment with interval 2016-07-01T00:00:00.000Z/2016-08-01T00:00:00.000Z (MONTH segmentGranularity) and another segment with interval 2016-06-27T00:00:00.000Z/2016-07-04T00:00:00.000Z (WEEK segmentGranularity). \r\n- The first problem is that auto compaction's `CompactionSegmentIterator` only return segment from a single time chunk bucket. For example, NewestSegmentFirstIterator would return the interval 2016-07-01T00:00:00.000Z/2016-08-01T00:00:00.000Z and submit a compaction task with the interval 2016-07-01T00:00:00.000Z/2016-08-01T00:00:00.000Z. However, the segment return from the iterator would only contains the MONTH segment and hence the sha256OfSortedSegmentIds calculated by auto compaction only contains the MONTH segment (2016-07-01T00:00:00.000Z/2016-08-01T00:00:00.000Z). This causes compaction task to fail when it starts running as the task would get all segments marked as used in the interval, which would be both the WEEK segment and MONTH segment, then compute the sha256 and compare it with the sha256 in the compaction spec. The sha256 would be different as the compaction task's sha256 only contains the MONTH segment. This issue is fixed by removing the sha256OfSortedSegmentIds from the compaction task spec created by auto compaction. sha256OfSortedSegmentIds was added in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8571 to enforce a limit on the number of segments in one compaction task. However, this is no longer necessary as compaction task can use parallel ingestion task. \r\n- The second issue arises when we do not set segmentGranularity in auto compaction config. When segmentGranularity in auto compaction config is not set, then the compaction task will determines the segmentGranularity from the segments marked used in the compaction task interval. In this case, the union interval of the used segments will be 2016-06-27T00:00:00.000Z/2016-08-01T00:00:00.000Z which will result in an invalid granularity. Compaction task should follow the same segmentGranularity as the bucketing in auto compaction's `CompactionSegmentIterator`. To fix this issue, the segmentGranularity to be used in compaction task is determined in auto compaction based on the segments returned by auto compaction's `CompactionSegmentIterator`, thus ensuring that we preserve the same bucketing/chunking of segments. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

a *response trailer* mechanism to include a map of values in the query response after the usual data results.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nDruid runs queries using a REST request/response protocol in which the response contains the query result set. There are several use cases where it would be useful to return additional performance data along with the result set. A concrete example is the [query profile](https://github.com/apache/drill/issues/2350) which can optionally return the profile when a query runs. Further, the query profile mechanism uses the response trailer to return a partial profile from each data node during execution.\r\n\r\nWhen not returning a full profile, it is still useful to return a small set of overall metrics. This PR includes only those summary metrics.\r\n\r\nSince query metrics are available, by definition, only at the completion of a query, it is necessary to return metrics and profile information *after* the data. Thus, the existing before-the-data header mechanism is not a good fit for this use case and we instead introduce a *response trailer* mechanism.\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\n\r\nThis PR and description are derived from a prototype which @gianm created.\r\n\r\n### Design\r\n\r\nWhen running a query with a JSON response format, the response is just the response set as an array of rows, where the rows can be in various formats. When the response trailer is enabled, the JSON response format changes to an object which includes the result set as one of the fields.\r\n\r\nThis change is clearly highly visible to clients which may expect the JSON array format. To avoid breaking such clients, the client must specifically request the revised format.\r\n\r\n#### `ResponseContext` changes\r\n\r\nThe `ResponseContext` gains a new field, `metrics` to gather the summary metrics. The field contains the object that generates the metrics shown in the API below. On the Broker, the `ResponseContext` may contain metrics for multiple subqueries.\r\n\r\nA previous PR clearly identified those `ResponseContext` fields which are to appear in the response header. Those fields not in the header are considered internal fields. This PR extends the idea to tag keys that appear in the trailer. The result is that fields can appear in the header, trailer, both or neither. (\"Neither\" is useful for keys that are only used internally by query engines within one server, like `timeoutAt` and `count`.)  \r\n\r\nThe new `metrics` key is tagged as trailer-only.\r\n\r\n#### \"Starter\" metrics\r\n\r\nUntil the full query profile is available, this PR motivates the response trailer by providing some basic metrics within the `metrics` key:\r\n\r\n* `resultRows`: the number of rows returned\r\n* `queryStart`: Query start time\r\n* `queryMs`: Query duration (up until the trailer is written)\r\n\r\nIn addition, the trailer contains fields which may have been truncated in the header:\r\n\r\n* `uncoveredIntervals`\r\n* `missingSegments`\r\n\r\n#### `QueryLifecycle` and `SqlLifecycle` changes\r\n\r\nThe `QueryResource` and `SqlResource` classes process each query, return the results, log data, return the response trailer (in this PR) and, later, will assemble and return the profile.\r\n\r\nTo better organize this work, the lifecycle classes each gain a `LifecycleStats` that gathers and distributes the above statistics.\r\n\r\n#### `QueryResponse`\r\n\r\nThe SQL-related code to run a query consists of many layers of functions which take the query as input and returns a sequence. The response context is created several layers down in the stack. To return the trailer, we must return the response context up through those top layers that today return only a sequence. The existing `QueryResponse` is pressed into service to solve this issue by wrapping the output sequence and the query profile.\r\n\r\nThe profile is made available in the `QueryResponse`, but it is not fully populated until the root `Sequence` returns all its results.\r\n\r\n#### `Query` changes\r\n\r\nDruid queries return a variety of results. The objects returned by a `Sequence` may not represent rows, but rather query-specific batches of rows. To obtain a row count, we must know how to interpret those results. The new `Query.getRowCountOf()` method does this work.\r\n\r\n#### `DirectDruidClient` changes\r\n\r\nThe internal Druid client uses the new results-with-trailer format. It copies the trailer fields into the client-side response context. The Broker-side merge merges results from may clients into the final response context.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nThe design does not use HTTP trailers. In theory the response context could have been sent using HTTP trailers. However, client and proxy support for HTTP trailers is spotty, and it isn't clear how much data is safe to send in a trailer. For these reasons, we chose to include the trailer in the regular response.\r\n\r\n### API\r\n\r\n#### Request\r\n\r\nIn native, include `trailer` context field. The two supported values are:\r\n\r\n`metrics`: include the metrics as described below.\r\n`context`: include all fields from the `ResponseContext` marked as included in the trailer.\r\n\r\nThe `trailer` value can be a single string or an array of strings. To include both metrics and the full context:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nPOST /druid/v2/\r\n{ ... // other query fields\r\n  \"context\": { \"trailer\": [ \"metrics\", \"context\" ] }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe array form allows us to add additional trailer information in the future, such as the query profile mentioned above.\r\n\r\nUnsupported values are ignored. Since the presence of the `trailer` field changes the result format of the query, to be extra cautious, the trailer format is used any time the field is present, even if the value is null or invalid.\r\n\r\nIn SQL, use the result format arrayWithTrailer:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nPOST /druid/v2/sql/\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wikipedia\",\r\n  \"resultFormat\": \"arrayWithTrailer\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSQL also recognizes the `trailer` context field to select what appears in the context. However the `trailer` field has effect only if `arrayWithTrailer` is set as shown above. The default, if `trailer` is unset, or has only invalid values, is `metrics`.\r\n\r\n#### Response\r\n\r\nIn both native and SQL:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"results\": [ ... ], // normal results\r\n  \"context\": { // trailer\r\n    \"metrics\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"segments\": 37,\r\n        \"segmentsProcessed\": 37,\r\n        \"segmentsVectorProcessed\": 37,\r\n        \"segmentRows\": 266472,\r\n        \"preFilteredRows\": 159739,\r\n        \"nodeRows\": 1,\r\n        \"resultRows\": 1,\r\n        \"cpuNanos\": 5027000,\r\n        \"threads\": 5,\r\n        \"queryStart\": 1627010838439,\r\n        \"queryMs\": 40\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"subQueryId\": \"ef46510d-668b-45e8-a9ef-9de55949342a_0\",\r\n        \"segments\": 37,\r\n        \"segmentsProcessed\": 37,\r\n        \"segmentsVectorProcessed\": 37,\r\n        \"segmentRows\": 266472,\r\n        \"preFilteredRows\": 194618,\r\n        \"nodeRows\": 52,\r\n        \"resultRows\": 5,\r\n        \"cpuNanos\": 9541000,\r\n        \"threads\": 5,\r\n        \"queryStart\": 1627010838461,\r\n        \"queryMs\": 11\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Results\r\n\r\nThe results key contains the actual query results. In native, it is an array that is identical to what you would have received if you did not request the trailer. In SQL it is identical to what you would have received if you set the result format to array.\r\n\r\n##### Context\r\n\r\nThe context key contains the response trailer. Inside the context is a metrics key that contains an array of query metric objects. There is one for the main query (which will be listed first) and one for each subquery (which will be listed in the order that they began execution).\r\n\r\nThe specific metrics should be considered an Alpha release: they are subject to change and will be re-evaluated once the full query profile is available.\r\n\r\nKeys that can be present in a the current \"starter\" query metric object are:\r\n\r\n`subQueryId`: Present for subqueries, absent for the main query. Useful for differentiating subqueries from each other, and for differentiating subqueries from the main query.\r\n\r\n`segments`: The number of segments that were considered by data servers. Includes segments that were not processed because the data server ultimately decided to use the per-segment query cache. Does not include segments that were pruned by the Broker. Equivalent to the count of the query/segmentAndCache/time metric.\r\n\r\n`segmentsProcessed`: The number of segments that were actually processed by data servers. Does not include segments whose results were served out of the per-segment query cache, or segments that were pruned by the Broker. Equivalent to the count of the query/segment/time metric.\r\n\r\n`segmentsVectorProcessed`: The number of segments that was actually processed by data servers, and were processed using a vectorized engine. This is a subset of segmentsProcessed.\r\n\r\n`segmentRows`: The total number of rows across all segments processed by data servers. May include rows that were not actually processed because they were filtered out using the index. May include rows that were not actually processed due to pushed-down limits.\r\n\r\n`preFilteredRows`: The total number of rows across all segments processed by data servers, after applying index-based filters, but before applying cursor-based filters. Will not be larger than segmentRows. This is the generally the number of rows processed by the query engine, except in cases where the query engine does not process all rows (such as SELECT * FROM tbl LIMIT 5, where limit pushdown means that data servers only read the first few rows).\r\n\r\n`nodeRows`: The total number of rows received by the Broker from data servers. May be larger than segmentRows and preFilteredRows due to caching: nodeRows includes rows served from the per-segment query cache, but segmentRows and preFilteredRows do not. May also be larger than preFilteredRows due to queries that generate more than one output row per input row.\r\n\r\n`resultRows`: The total number of rows returned by this query after processing has completed on the Broker. This is how many rows a user would receive after issuing the query.\r\n\r\n`cpuNanos`: The total number of nanoseconds of CPU time used by this query, summed up across all servers. Equivalent to the sum of the query/cpu/time metric.\r\n\r\n`threads`: The total number of threads that participated in this query. Note that not all threads are necessarily active at the same time.\r\n\r\n`queryStart`: The time this query started, in milliseconds since the epoch.\r\n\r\n`queryMs`: The duration of this query, in milliseconds. This is similar to the query/time metric, but not quite equivalent, because it only measures the time until the response trailer starts being written. The query/time metric includes the time it takes to write the response trailer and fully flush the connection to the client.\r\n\r\n### Backward Compatibility\r\n\r\nThe trailer appears for client queries only if the client explicitly requests it via the `X-Druid-Include-Trailer` header. Since existing clients do not include this header, existing clients will see no functional difference.\r\n\r\nThe response trailer is always enabled for internal queries between the broker and data nodes, etc. This change is transparent to clients. If a client directly queries a data node, then the above rule applies: the `X-Druid-Include-Trailer` header must be set.\r\n\r\nThe addition of the trailer changes the format of internal query responses. The following ensures services can be upgraded in any order:\r\n\r\n* An old Broker won't request the trailer, so new data nodes will not return one.\r\n* A new Broker will request the trailer, but will accept the old array format.\r\n\r\nWhen running test cases, it appears that some tests may mock or otherwise simulate the data node response to the broker. In this case, the new Broker requests a header, but the mocking code returns an array format. The \"will accept the old array format\" ensures that these tests continue to run.\r\n\r\n### Minor Revisions\r\n\r\nThe PR includes a number of minor refactoring moves:\r\n\r\n#### `QueryResource`\r\n\r\nPull the `StreamingOutput` subclass out as a named class in `QueryResource` so it is easier to see which parts occur within the message handler, and which occur asynchronously to produce the output.\r\n\r\n#### Optional `druid.server.http.minThreads` config parameter\r\n\r\nAdd a `minThreads` to the Jetty server configuration to optionally reduce the initial number of Jetty worker threads to make the IDE experience a bit easier. The default is to retain the current behavior. To change the minimum (and startup) number of threads, add the following to the common config file:\r\n\r\n```text\r\ndruid.server.http.minThreads=2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe thread pool will expand the thread count on demand up to `maxThreads`, so this change affects only the *initial* thread count.\r\n\r\n### `SqlResource` error handling\r\n\r\nAdded a distinct error code, 409 CONFLICT, for the query cancellation case to differentiate cancellation from internal error.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nDeflaked several tests. Modified others to avoid timeout while debugging. Reduced copy/paste revisions for handling the new header field.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [X] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) \r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes a performance regression caused by #11853, where adding type information to the `RowBasedColumnSelectorFactory` of `IncrementalIndex` was done by using the `getColumnCapabilities` method the latter had, which built a hashmap of all the capabilities and then translated that into a `RowSignature`. This turned out to be very dramatically expensive.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, `IncrementalIndex` now just implements `ColumnInspector` so that it can cut out the middle-man and serve as the `ColumnInspector` for the `RowBasedColumnSelectorFactory`.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-12-09 at 2 27 38 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/145486999-7fe3e064-3779-424d-9c88-9a111617e2ec.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-12-09 at 2 27 28 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/145487077-b868e1b5-98f6-42f8-bd2f-86d002f0921e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nZoomed into sink.add:\r\nbefore:\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-12-09 at 2 28 40 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/145487072-33547634-06bc-4f04-9550-469e4cf3b9b2.png)\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-12-09 at 2 28 31 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/145487010-83f873a3-5856-4c5c-968d-823ee3cb84c9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nTask run times are shorter too:\r\nbefore:\r\n<img width=\"1640\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-09 at 2 24 21 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/145487240-9633c828-d300-44e4-bfa6-dd84eed30405.png\">\r\nafter:\r\n<img width=\"1639\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-09 at 2 27 00 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/145487244-6642a2aa-ccfb-456d-9078-9179fcd0be8e.png\">\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nIn [Grouping#applyProject](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/6ac4e2dbb8d2e390f0f4a9c0130ce2fb223c297b/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/sql/calcite/rel/Grouping.java#L188), their is an attempt made to reduce the dimensions on which group by is done, if they are not appearing in the final result/`Project`.\r\nHowever, this ends up removing all of the literal dimensions which are present in the group by. \r\nConsider the following query\r\n```\r\nSELECT dim1, 'dummy' FROM druid.foo GROUP BY dim1, 'dummy'\r\n```\r\nAccording to our intentions, the 'dummy' shouldn't be removed in the GROUP BY, since it is present in the projection, but it gets removed (Due to the implementation of the `RelOptUtil.InputFinder.bits(project.getChildExps(), null);` not setting bit corresponding to `dummy` to true. It is a `RexLiteral` as opposed to `RexInputRef`.\r\n\r\nIn a more obscure case like:\r\n```\r\nSELECT 'A', dim1 FROM druid.foo WHERE m1 = 10310313 AND dim1 = 'dummy' GROUP BY dim1\r\n```\r\nThe dim1 gets reduced to 'dummy' by Calcite (and is treated as a literal), which gets subsequently removed by the current implementation of the Groupings#applyProject, and it results a row of ('A', 'dummy') when it shouldn't have returned anything. \r\n\r\nThis fix changes the visitor which is used to find  the literals in the input expression, and directly compares the DruidExpression of the literal in the input expression, with the dimensions in the group by. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

But there is a bug which early stop is applied to the first task only, when the number of tasks are two or more. `earlyStopTime` variable is not null, it means all the tasks need to be stopped early. But `earlyStopTime` variable is changed to null at the fist iteration, and then the other iterations of tasks can not recognize the condition of early stop.\r\nThe fix is trivial. I just modified not to change `earlyStopTime` variable to null in the loop. And I added `earlyStopRequested` variable to reset `earlyStopTime` varibale outside the loop.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen we use druid for various query operations, there may be some query requests that take a long time. These query requests may be some bad query requests. If there are many such requests, it will cause a lot of pressure on druid, so we hope A metric can be added to count the number of occurrences of these query requests, and to mark these requests in the request log. So that we can analyze these queries and can make it a little easier for cluster operators to diagnose query issues better.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new query metric query/long/count  that represents the number of long queries during the emission period and request logging will mark if this request is a long query request\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x]  been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x]  added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x]  added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x]  added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for code coverage is

Description\r\n\r\nAdd a config parameter for appending tasks to allow them to\r\nuse a SHARED lock.  This will allow multiple appending tasks\r\nto add segments to the same datasource at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis config should actually be the default, but it is added\r\nas a config to enable a smooth transition/validation in\r\nproduction settings before forcing it as the default\r\nbehavior going forward.\r\n\r\nThis change leverages the TaskLockType.SHARED that existed\r\npreviously, this used to carry the semantics of a READ lock,\r\nwhich was \"escalated\" when the task wanted to actually\r\npersist the segment.  As of many moons before this diff, the\r\nSHARED lock had stopped being used but was still piped into\r\nthe code.  It turns out that with a few tweaks, it can be\r\nadjusted to be a shared lock for append tasks to allow them\r\nall to write to the same datasource, so that is what this does.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * New task context on append tasks: `useSharedLock`.  Defaults to false.  Exists to validate functionality in production environments before shared locks are made the default and only type of lock for appending tasks to use.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

Description\r\nWhen we use druid for various query operations, there may be some query requests that take a long time. These query requests may be some bad query requests. If there are many such requests, it will cause a lot of pressure on druid, so we hope A metric can be added to count the number of occurrences of these query requests, and to mark these requests in the request log. So that we can analyze these queries and can make it a little easier for cluster operators to diagnose query issues better.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new query metric query/long/count  that represents the number of long queries during the emission period and request logging will mark if this request is a long query request\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for code coverage is

now there is a bug that can lead to parts of queries typed into the query view being lost:\r\n\r\nTo repro:\r\n\r\n1. Run some query e.g:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n  channel,\r\n  COUNT(*) AS \"Count\"\r\nFROM wikipedia\r\nGROUP BY 1\r\nORDER BY 2 DESC\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Edit the query somehow, say change \"Count\" to \"CountBlah\"\r\n\r\n3. Use the table actions to modify the query:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/145162336-0fe6fd8b-579e-49aa-978a-be1534e1c8c6.png)\r\n\r\nNotice the query edit of \"Blah\" is lost as the table action overwrites the query completely.\r\n\r\nInstead it should now provide an action (a function that takes a query and manipulates it) instead so the action is simply applied to the edited query.\r\n\r\nThis PR also:\r\n- Skips the java check in the helper script to make JDK11 dev easier\r\n- Simplifies the format guesser\r\n- Adds and improves react hooks\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-08T06:56:20Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:37:11Z","closed_at":"2021-12-08T21:01:29Z","merged_at":"2021-12-08T21:01:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"6ac4e2dbb8d2e390f0f4a9c0130ce2fb223c297b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1251906357,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUxOTA2MzU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Web%20Console","name":"Area

This is a similar issue to what I had seen in the past when the job went into a graceful shutdown of a hadoop ingestion job (https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9785). I'm suspicious that moving the file deletes into their own static JobHelper method introduced this experience I am seeing (https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11194). The call to authenticate is idempotent. If the authentication is already done, no action will be taken. ~I added a debug log to help people trouble shooting potential issues in the future.~\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrent HTTP APIs return different formats of response. In most cases, if the status code is 200, a JSON object is returned. If the status code is not 200, there're several formats, some return a JSON object, some return text. For those APIs that return text, there might be vulnerabilities that allows hackers to launch an XSS attack.\r\n\r\nIn order to make code safe, this PR unifies the API that construct a safe Response object. \r\n\r\nAfter this PR, for those HTTP responses whose Status Code is not 200:\r\n1. there's alway a Content-Type in the response header which is set to 'application/json'\r\n2. and the HTTP body is a JSON object which currently has one field named as \"error\".\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"error\" : \"xxxx\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to make sure the new API is always used in the future code, the raw `javax.ws.rs.core.Response#status` API is forbidden.\r\n\r\n### API Description\r\n\r\nThe New API is defined as `HttpResponses`. Here's an example that compares how we construct a Response object in old and new API.\r\n\r\n#### Old ways\r\n\r\n```java\r\nreturn Response.status(Response.Status.BAD_REQUEST)\r\n                     .entity(ImmutableMap.<String, Object>of(\r\n                         \"error\",\r\n                         StringUtils.format(UNKNOWN_AUTHENTICATOR_MSG_FORMAT, authenticatorName)\r\n                     ))\r\n                     .build();\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### New API\r\n\r\nWith the New API, above code can be simplified as \r\n\r\n```java\r\nreturn HttpResponses.BAD_REQUEST.error(UNKNOWN_AUTHENTICATOR_MSG_FORMAT, authenticatorName);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### API lists\r\n\r\nBelow are the APIs that are provided by `HttpResponses`\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// returns a WebApplicationException that wraps a Response object\r\npublic RuntimeException exception(String message);\r\n\r\n// returns a HTTP Response whose Content-Type is text/plain\r\npublic Response text(String message);\r\n\r\n// returns an HTTP Response in error format. And the Content-Type is application/json\r\npublic Response error(String message);\r\n\r\n// returns an HTTP Response in error format. And the Content-Type is application/json\r\npublic Response error(@Nullable Throwable t);\r\n\r\n// returns an HTTP Response in JSON format with given object\r\npublic Response entity(@Nonnull Object entity)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Incompatibility\r\n\r\nSince this PR changes all current code to use the new API, there're some compatibility problems. Some HTTP endpoints now returns a JSON instead of returning a text-based response if the Response's status code is not 200. If clients have code to check the returned message for error processing, they need to change their code to adapt to the new returned format.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What's not done in this PR\r\n\r\n`Response.ok()` can be replaced by the new API `HttpResponses.OK.json()` so that we don't mix the old `Response` and new `HttpResponses` in the code. \r\n\r\nBut it's not forbidden in this PR because the new one is just a replacement which won't introduce any compatibility problems. Since there're lots of reference of such API, and changes in this PR is already too large,  I think we can do that replacement in a following PR once this is merged.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ResponseStatusException` is added to wrap any exceptions that want to return specific HTTP status code\r\n *  `ResponseStatusExceptionMapper` is provided to map any `ResponseStatusException` to a HTTP response which contains the error message in json format\r\n * `HttpResponses` defines a set of common used HTTP status codes and APIs to return a Response object.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes two issues with multi-value string handling in SQL, both involving constant expressions on string columns which produce array types.\r\n\r\nThe first issue is at the SQL layer, where an array producing expression such as `STRING_TO_MV` in an SQL that could be reduced to a constant would cause a casting exception because the `ARRAY<STRING>` typed output of the constant can not be cast to a string for the `VARCHAR` literal it is trying to create.\r\n\r\nFixing this issue uncovered a second problem, this one down in the native engine, where dim selectors on constant expressions would end up using `ConstantDimensionSelector` which converts the expression result into a single string value, which is incorrect for an array typed expression. To handle this, a new `ConstantMultiValueDimensionSelector` has been added that accepts a `List<String>` as input and makes a constant selector on that, allowing array expression constants to work with dimension selectors.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an

Description\r\nThe documentation specifies that using a `timeout` of `0`, however this was actually a lie and specifying a timeout of 0 would cause a query to timeout and fail immediately.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue, but also doesn't completely allow infinite timeout to be totally within the users control (with no way for the server-side to mitigate) so instead allows 0 to use the maximum server-side timeout `druid.server.http.maxQueryTimeout`, which defaults to `Long.MAX_VALUE` so is effectively unlimited unless explicitly configured by operators.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue in which if a lookup is configured incorreclty; does not serialize properly when being pulled by peon node, it causes the task to fail. The failure occurs because the peon and other leaf nodes (broker, historical), have retry logic that continues to retry the lookup loading for 3 minutes by default. The http listener thread on the peon task is not started until lookup loading completes, by default, the overlord waits 1 minute by default, to communicate with the peon task to get the task status, after which is orders the task to shut down, causing the ingestion task to fail.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, we catch the exception serialization error, and do not retry. Also fixed an issue in which a bad lookup config interferes with any other good lookup configs from being loaded.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis is a follow up to the PR #11908. This fixes the bug in top level union all queries when there are more than 2 SQL subqueries are present. For example, if the following query was passed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT channel FROM wikipedia\r\nUNION ALL SELECT channel FROM wikipedia WHERE channel = '#en.wikipedia'\r\nUNION ALL SELECT channel FROM wikipedia WHERE channel = '#de.wikipedia'\r\n```\r\nit would fail to be explained in the newer format, and would revert to the original plan. \r\nReason for the bug: In the original PR, I assumed that `DruidUnionRel` can only be the top level DruidRel node after parsing, according to the comment [here](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/1f95a42bb8b32c314934e8e2ecdeb6569c7e8db3/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/sql/calcite/rel/DruidUnionRel.java#L48), and all the three queries would be children to that top level parent node.\r\n\r\nWhen there are more than 2 queries connected by a top level UNION ALL, then the DruidRel structure looks like this:\r\n```\r\nDruidUnionRel\r\n  DruidRel (query 1)\r\n  DruidUnionRel\r\n    DruidRel (query 2)\r\n    DruidRel (query 3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a recursive method which flattens this structure, and produces the native queries as expected.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DruidPlanner`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis PR adds a fallback mechanism to `DruidSchema` to use the legacy 'type' string field of segment metadata results, after #11895 changed `DruidSchema` to use a new, richer, `typeSignature` field instead. This fixes an issue where the SQL schema for a datasource can be marked entirely as `COMPLEX` typed columns if a broker is updated to 0.23 before historical servers are, and will remain in this state until restarted or all segments have been moved to new servers after all historicals are upgraded. See https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11713#issuecomment-983269047 for details.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

#10606.\r\n(This is a rework of previous PR #10699 by @capistrant , which was closed without merging)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPlease reference the proposal for detailed information. I will provide a summary here:\r\n\r\nI am proposing an optional new DutiesRunnable in the DruidCoordinator. Operators can choose whether or not to break primary replicant loading out into its own DutiesRunnable. If they choose not to enable the dedicated primary replicant loading, their coordinator will function just as it always has. If they choose to enable the dedicated primary replicant loading, their coordinator will add a scheduled DutiesRunnable dedicated to executing matching LoadRule for segments and only doing the primary replicant load for that LoadRule when run. The HistoricalManagement DutiesRunnable will continue all other HistoricalManagement duties including performing non-primary replicant loading and replicant dropping while executing a matched LoadRule for a segment.\r\n\r\nMy implementation for the proposal exposes two new Coordinator runtime configurations for operators: `druid.coordinator.loadPrimaryReplicantSeparately` and `druid.coordinator.period.primaryReplicantLoaderPeriod`. If they choose to enable the first, then a scheduled executor with a configurable backoff period is configured for loading primary replicants.\r\n\r\nImportantly, this PR also **introduces concurrency to the Coordinator**, via the configuration `druid.coordinator.dutiesRunnableExecutor.threadPoolSize`.  This thread poll was previously hard-coded to contain only 1 thread.\r\n\r\nI am marking this with Design Review label because the proposal never got the traction I wanted to confirm the design. Thus, this will require 2 +1's from committers before merge.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DruidCoordinator`\r\n * `LoadRule`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR has 2 changes as noted in the title.\r\n\r\n#### Making `NodeRole` available during binding\r\n\r\nSometimes we want to load some modules or even bind some objects on only certain node types. For example, deep storage extension modules don't have to be loaded in the coordinator, it isn't harm to do though. We are using `NodeRole`s to represent node types which are injected through our regular injection process. As a result, nodeRoles are only available after binding is done but is not available during binding. This PR fills in this gap by adding a new phase between the startup phase and the binding phase that binds nodeRoles first before others and provide them for binding rest of modules. There are 2 ways to use the nodeRole information.\r\n\r\n1) Using `LoadScope` annotation. This example shows how to load a module only in brokers and historicals using this annotation.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@LoadScope({\"broker\", \"historical\"})\r\npublic class MyModule implements Module\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n`LoadScope` annotations are added for materialized view extensions as an example (and also to fix the problem that they have to be loaded in only broker or coordinator).\r\n\r\nModules without this annotation will be loaded in every node.\r\n\r\n2) Injecting nodeRoles in the module. This example shows how to bind objects only in brokers.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class MyModule implements Module\r\n{\r\n    private Set<NodeRole> nodeRoles;\r\n\r\n    @Inject\r\n    public void init(@Self Set<NodeRole> nodeRoles)\r\n    {\r\n      this.nodeRoles = nodeRoles;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void configure(Binder binder)\r\n    {\r\n      if (nodeRoles.contains(NodeRole.BROKER) {\r\n        // do something\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Dynamic registration of `DruidServices`\r\n\r\n`DruidService` represents the service type served by each node and is announced along with node information together. Currently, each node has a fixed set of `DruidServices` which are hard-coded in each `Cli*` class. This PR makes it customizable, so that extensions can register their own custom `DruidServices` when they are loaded. Here is an example for how to do it.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class MyDruidServiceModule extends AbstractDruidServiceModule\r\n{\r\n  @ProvidesIntoSet\r\n  @Named(\"broker\")\r\n  public Class<? extends DruidService> getMyService()\r\n  {\r\n    return MyService.class;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  protected NodeRole getNodeRoleKey()\r\n  {\r\n    return NodeRole.BROKER;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, `MyService` will be announced as one of the broker services if the extension is loaded.\r\n\r\nIntegration tests are not added in this PR. I could add some as a follow-up.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `GuiceRunnable`\r\n * `ServerRunnable`\r\n * `Initialization`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

\"Aggregators\", about the lgK setting, it said \"Must be a power of 2 from 4 to 21 inclusively.\"  21 is not a power of 2, nor is 12, the given default.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

The metric value is the milliseconds waited. The new dimension is a boolean that states if the wait was successful or not. The value of this metric is that it tells operators how long the coordinator is taking to distribute segments to historicals after indexing completes. As an operator myself, I track this value to make sure our coordinator performance is up to the expectation of users when it comes to how long after indexing completes their data is available.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Description\r\n\r\n`DruidSchema` consists of a concurrent HashMap of `DataSource` -> `Segement` -> `AvailableSegmentMetadata`. `AvailableSegmentMetadata` contains `RowSignature` of the segment, and for each segment, a new object is getting created. RowSignature is an immutable class, and hence it can be interned, and this can lead to huge savings of memory being used in broker, since a lot of the segments of a table would potentially have same RowSignature.\r\n\r\nFollowing are some heap dumps of the broker attached for some experiments. The data being ingested is the quickstart `wikipedia` data, but the secondary partition is dynamic with 1 max row per segment, to generate a lot of segments which the `DruidSchema` would have to cache. Also, the configuration used is `start-single-server-small`. \r\nFor the normal testing `apache-druid-0.22.0` was used while the patch was tested on top of the `master` branch (shouldn't cause much difference).\r\n\r\n1.\r\nNo additional columns were appended to the existing columns of the wiki data.\r\n#### Non Interned\r\n![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 1 19 07 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30999375/143933629-63366e17-1288-4ba7-8ba7-8eab811443c2.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 1 19 45 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30999375/143933700-c4a88d0e-64f5-4c2b-b970-b355378c3569.png)\r\n\r\n#### Interned\r\n![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 1 20 04 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30999375/143933765-b888b5fa-92ba-4dea-a9c0-850e5dab914a.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 1 20 19 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30999375/143933804-26b362d8-a091-4f71-a2d6-4e914355e01b.png)\r\n\r\n2.\r\n51 addititonal columns were appended to the original columns with names \"random-#\" to increase the memory footprint of the RowSignature.\r\n#### Non Interned\r\n![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 1 20 42 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30999375/143933860-78c483d5-7aef-44ba-959c-93162c2f8f00.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 1 20 54 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30999375/143933892-035c6023-5365-465f-afcc-500061c3bedb.png)\r\n \r\n#### Interned\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 1 21 15 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30999375/143933921-4b14e2c3-abbc-497b-9b13-9031d5ed26ba.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 1 21 33 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30999375/143933941-986d69c4-2e0b-40a9-8763-b06ec2cd767a.png)\r\n\r\nThis change precomputes the hash of the RowSignature, since its an immutable object, as well as uses an interner in the DruidSchema to generate the AvailableSegmentMetadata objects.\r\n\r\nBenchmark was added to see the effect of interning on the time required to create the DruidSchema object. It can be removed in the end, if not required. Also, a couple of methods had to be moved from package-private to protected for use in the benchmark, which might be an argument for punting it in the final changes.\r\n\r\nSynthetic test scenario used to measure the impact, so it might differ in a real use case, but I think the memory savings should still be present in real use cases. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DruidSchema` - Intern the RowSignature\r\n * `RowSignature` - Precompute the hash function\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Fixing the usage of the factory by promoting it to the instance level.  From the javadocs \r\n\r\n`Default constructor used to create factory instances. Creation of a factory instance is a light-weight operation, but it is still a good idea to reuse limited number of factory instances (and quite often just a single instance): factories are used as context for storing some reused processing objects (such as symbol tables parsers use) and this reuse only works within context of a single factory instance.`\r\n\r\nThanks, @cheddar for pointing it out. \r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\nThis PR adds a new cache feature for broker.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nCurrently, the broker can't provide a caching capability for relatively fixed queries need to scan both historical and realtime segments and with time range filter, like the day so far or this week/month/year so far.\r\nIt would be useful to have a cache feature to cache merged results of historical segments on Broker. It could be expected as a better cache option on Broker for the following use cases.\r\n|                      | Case 1: can work when using group by v2 engine | Case 2: can work when scanning historical segments only | Case 3: can work when scanning both historical and realtime segments | Case 4: be efficient to cache large number of segments |\r\n| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |\r\n| Segment Level cache  | &cross;                                        | &check;                                                 | &check;                                                      | &cross;                                                |\r\n| Result level cache   | &cross;                                        | &check;                                                 | &cross;                                                      | &check;                                                |\r\n| **New segment merged cache** | &check;                                        | &check;                                                 | &check;                                                      | &check;                                                |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed changes\r\n|Property|Possible Values|Description|Default|\r\n|--------|---------------|-----------|-------|\r\n|`druid.broker.cache.useSegmentMergedResultCache`|true, false|Enable segment merged result cache on the Broker. This cache option can be useful for queries need to scan both historical and realtime segments and with time range filter, like the day so far or this week/month/year so far. It can't work together with segment level cache(see `druid.broker.cache.useCache` and `druid.broker.cache.populateCache`) on Broker. If both segment merged result cache and segment level cache are enabled at the same time, then only segment merged result cache will work.|false|\r\n|`druid.broker.cache.populateSegmentMergedResultCache`|true, false|Populate segment merged result cache on the Broker. See also `druid.broker.cache.useSegmentMergedResultCache`.|false|\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\nAs we know that the segment level cache on broker can't work for group by v2 engine and is not very efficient for large number of segments. And the result level cache also can't work for queries need to scan realtime segments. The segment merged result cache tries to solve the limitation of the existing two cache options on Broker. The segment merged result caching feature works like\r\n<img width=\"995\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44718283/144346105-09d9691c-3cc5-44f2-a227-3f714c41c43c.png\">\r\n\r\n### Operational impact\r\n\r\n1. recommend to increase the `cache.maxEntrySize` on broker\r\n2. the `*/hits` and `*/hitRate` metrics might seem incorrect from query caching hitting view as we need to check extra info from the cache entry to determine whether to accept the entry. The result level cache has same issue. \r\n\r\n### Test plan\r\nBelow is the benchmark result(`useParallelMergePool=true` by default)  or view [graph of benchmark

Description\r\nThis PR adds two new array functions to Druid.\r\n| function | description |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| array_contains_contiguous_subarray(arr,expr) | returns 1 if the array contains the element specified by expr, or contains contiguous subarray(see [substring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substring)) specified by expr if expr is an array, else 0 |\r\n| array_contains_subsequence(arr,expr) | returns 1 if the array contains the element specified by expr, or contains [subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence) specified by expr if expr is an array, else 0 |\r\n\r\nThe two array functions can be typically used as filters on [multi-value dimensions](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/multi-value-dimensions.html) to do funnel analysis for user behaviour analytics.\r\nBelow is a simple example of user behaviour data\r\n```json\r\n{\"timestamp\": \"2011-01-12T00:00:00.000Z\", \"user\": \"id1\", \"events\": [\"login\",\"home\",\"search\"]} \r\n{\"timestamp\": \"2011-01-13T00:00:00.000Z\", \"user\": \"id2\", \"events\": [\"home\",\"search\",\"shop\"]} \r\n{\"timestamp\": \"2011-01-14T00:00:00.000Z\", \"user\": \"id3\", \"events\": [\"home\",\"product\",\"cart\"]}\r\n```\r\nWe can query how many users get through a series of steps\r\n```sql\r\nselect APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(user) from ds_name where MV_CONTAINS_SUBSEQUENCE(events, ARRAY['home', 'product'])\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `Function`\r\n * `ArrayContainsSubsequenceOperatorConversion`\r\n *
