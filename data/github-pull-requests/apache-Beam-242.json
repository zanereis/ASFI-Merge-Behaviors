PR replaces the `gsutil cp` call with a GCS API call when staging resources.\r\n\r\nI was unsure how to unit test this feature, and given that the existing functionality was not under test already, I just tested this with the following script:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom apache_beam.runners.dataflow.internal import dependency\r\ndependency._dependency_file_copy('/home/david/myfile.txt', 'gs://mybucket/myfile.txt')\r\ndependency._dependency_file_copy('gs://mybucket/myfile.txt', 'gs://mybucket/myfile2.txt')\r\ndependency._dependency_file_copy('gs://mybucket/myfile2.txt', '/home/david/myfile2.txt')\r\n```\r\nAll three operations are successful.\r\n\r\nI've set up travis-ci for the build, and it is successful for the python tests but not the Java tests (it looks like this is a general issue at the moment).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBe sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\r\nquickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure the PR title is

This is uniform with other IO such as HDFS.\r\n- Moved `CoderBasedKafkaSerializer` out, and added `CoderBaseKafkaDeserializer`. These are used for `toAvro/fromAvro`, and can be useful to port existing code that relies on coder.\r\n- Added `InstantSerializer` and `InstantDeserializer`, as `Instant` is used in some of the tests.\r\n \r\nWriter lets Kafka handle serialization itself. Reader uses Kafka byte deserializers, and calls the user-provided Kafka deserializer from `advance`. Note that Kafka serializers and deserializers are not themselves `Serializable`. Hence, I've used a `Class<..>` in the `spec` both for read and write.\r\n\r\nThere is still an issue, though. `Read` still takes **both a deserializer and a coder**. This is because the source must implement `getDefaultOutputCoder`, and I am not sure how to infer it. Having to provide the two is heavy, but I am not sure how to infer the coders in this context. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\ncc @rangadi
