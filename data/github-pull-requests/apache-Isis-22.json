previously deprecated methods and classes (including org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist; use\norg.jsoup.safety.Safelist instead).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when converting jsoup Documents to W3C Documents in W3CDom, preserve HTML valid attribute names if the\ninput document is using the HTML syntax. (Previously, would always coerce using the more restrictive XML syntax.)\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1648\">jhy/jsoup#1648</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the :containsWholeText(text) selector, to match against non-normalized Element text. That can be\nuseful when elements can only be distinguished by e.g. specific case, or leading whitespace, etc.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636\">jhy/jsoup#1636</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when evaluating an XPath query against a context element, the complete document is now visible to the\nquery, vs only the context element's sub-tree. This enables support for queries outside (parent or sibling) the\nelement, e.g. ancestor-or-self::*.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1652\">jhy/jsoup#1652</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: allow a maxPaddingWidth on the indent level in OutputSettings when pretty printing.

encapsulate multi select toggles\r\n- [x] `DataTableModel` to encapsulate sorting (`SortedByFacet`)\r\n- [x] `DataTableModel` to encapsulate filtering via search argument (just prepare the model)\r\n- [x] Memento for `DataTableModel` \r\n- [ ] ... that on recreation (from action or coll) does not trigger domain events\r\n- [x] Parented Collection Panel to use `DataTableModel`\r\n- [x] Standalone Collection Panel to use `DataTableModel`\r\n- [x] Wire up associated _Actions_ with choices from a _Collection_ to use `DataTableModel` selection model as choice provider\r\n- [x] Convert all implementations of `ValueFacetUsingSemanticsProviderFactory` to Spring managed components\r\n- [x] ... with the exception of ValueSemantics for _enums_, which are managed by _Isis_\r\n- [x] remove
