patch adds checks before reading the first record of a control batch. If the batch is empty, it is treated as having already been cleaned. In the case of LogCleaner this means it is safe to discard. In the case of ProducerStateManager it means it shouldn't cause state to be stored because the relevant transaction has already been cleaned. In the case of Fetcher, it just preempts the check for an abort. In the case of GroupMetadataManager, it doesn't process the offset as a commit. The patch also adds isControl to the output of DumpLogSegments. Changes were tested with unit tests, except the DumpLogSegments change which was tested manually.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

PR has the changes required to implement KIP-372.\r\n\r\n1. Name repartition topics for Joins\r\n2. Name repartition topics for Grouping operations\r\n3. For optimizations where repartition nodes are reduced or merged the topic name of the **_first_** repartition node to be merged is used as the topic name for the new optimized repartition node.\r\n4. Added the `Grouped` class\r\n5. Deprecated the `Serialized` class\r\n6. Updated Joined to accept a `name` parameter for naming repartition topics if required.\r\n6. Updated KStream.groupBy, KStream.groupByKey, KTable.groupBy methods to accept a `Grouped` instance and deprecated methods taking a `Serialized` parameter.\r\n\r\nAlso, our approach when optimizing repartition topic is to **_always_** use the first repartition topic to get merged even if the user has elected to not name any repartition topics.  This approach should make the new topology compatible with existing applications.  However, an application reset may be required as all data may not have been consumed from existing repartition topics.\r\n\r\nI've added tests for the following:\r\n\r\n1. Verify that named repartition topics stay unchanged when topology changes.\r\n2. Verify that user-specified repartition topic names are used over Streams generated names.\r\n2. Verify that when optimization occurs, the new optimized repartition topic is the same name as the **_first_** replaced/merged repartition node.\r\n3. The existing tests validate that when names for repartition topics are not provided the Streams generated names are used. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

of EasyMock and PowerMock has stagnated while Mockito\r\ncontinues to be actively developed. With the new Java release cadence,\r\nit's a problem to depend on libraries that do bytecode manipulation\r\nand are not actively maintained. In addition, Mockito is also\r\neasier to use.\r\n\r\nWhile updating the tests, I attempted to go from failing test to\r\npassing test. In cases where the updated test passed on the first\r\nattempt, I artificially broke it to ensure the test was still doing its\r\njob.\r\n\r\nI included a few improvements that were helpful while making these\r\nchanges:\r\n\r\n1. Better exception if there are no nodes in `leastLoadedNodes`\r\n2. Always close the producer in `KafkaProducerTest`\r\n3. requestsInFlight producer metric should not hold a reference to\r\n`Sender`\r\n\r\nFinally, `Metadata` is no longer final so that we don't need\r\n`PowerMock` to mock it. It's an internal class, so it's OK.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-25T15:41:02Z","updated_at":"2018-10-10T18:05:52Z","closed_at":"2018-10-09T22:57:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9c2014df2ff0ee0b6c64f244795b9bf809c3ff4e","assignee":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5691/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5691/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5691/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/f6a7beb90f75ee23d856bb1d76f288d5e8330e4f","head":{"label":"ijuma:kafka-7438-mockito","ref":"kafka-7438-mockito","sha":"f6a7beb90f75ee23d856bb1d76f288d5e8330e4f","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32646946,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjY0Njk0Ng==","name":"kafka","full_name":"ijuma/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma/kafka","description":"Mirror

patch ensures that the leader epoch cache is updated when a broker becomes leader with the latest epoch and the log end offset as its starting offset. This guarantees that the leader will be able to provide the right truncation point even if the follower has data from leader epochs which the leader itself does not have. This situation can occur when there are back to back leader elections.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have made the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. The leader epoch cache enforces monotonically increase epochs and starting offsets among its entry. Whenever a new entry is appended which violates requirement, we remove the conflicting entries from the cache.\r\n2. Previously we returned an unknown epoch and offset if an epoch is queried which comes before the first entry in the cache. Now we return the smallest . For example, if the earliest entry in the cache is (epoch=5, startOffset=10), then a query for epoch 4 will return (epoch=4, endOffset=10). This ensures that followers (and consumers in KIP-320) can always determine where the correct starting point is for the active log range on the leader.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

I was writing [an example project on testing Kafka Streams](https://github.com/dongjinleekr/kafka-streams-example), I found that there are several problems with the documentation of `IntegrationTestUtils.`\r\n\r\n- The documentation of `Time` parameter in `produceKeyValuesSynchronously` methods is missing. This parameter was added in commit de1b853, but documentation was omitted then.\r\n- Change parameter `enableTransactions` in `produceKeyValuesSynchronouslyWithTimestamp(String, Collection, Properties, Headers headers, Long, boolean)` into `enableTransactions`: for consistency with the other overloads.\r\n- Add Javadoc to undocumented methods, like `produceKeyValuesSynchronouslyWithTimestamp`, `waitUntilMinRecordsReceived`, etc.\r\n- Fix ordering: `waitUntilMinRecordsReceived`\r\n- Upper bound in ... -> Upper bound of ...\r\n\r\n### Committer

patch contains the broker-side support for the fencing improvements from KIP-320. This includes the leader epoch validation in the ListOffsets, OffsetsForLeaderEpoch, and Fetch APIs as well as the changes needed in the fetcher threads to maintain and use the current leader epoch. The client changes from KIP-320 will be left for a follow-up.\r\n\r\nOne notable change worth mentioning is that we now require the read lock in `Partition` in order to read from the log or to query offsets. This is necessary to ensure the safety of the leader epoch validation. Additionally, we forward all leader epoch changes to the replica fetcher thread and go through the truncation phase. This is needed to ensure the fetcher always has the latest epoch and to guarantee that we cannot miss needed truncation if we missed an epoch change.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

change adds some basic system tests for delegation token based authentication:\r\n- basic delegation token creation\r\n- producing with a delegation token\r\n- consuming with a delegation token\r\n- expiring a delegation token \r\n- producing with an expired delegation token\r\n\r\nNew files:\r\n- delegation_tokens.py: a wrapper around kafka-delegation-tokens.sh  - executed in container where a secure Broker is running (taking advantage of automatic cleanup)\r\n- delegation_tokens_test.py: basic test to validate the lifecycle of a delegation token\r\n\r\nChanges were made in the following file to extend their functionality:\r\n- config_property was updated to be able to configure Kafka brokers with delegation token related settings\r\n- jaas.conf template because a broker needs to support multiple login modules when delegation tokens are used\r\n- consule-consumer and verifiable_producer to override KAFKA_OPTS (to specify custom jaas.conf) and the client properties (to authenticate with delegation token).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-18T14:42:41Z","updated_at":"2022-10-19T21:06:26Z","closed_at":"2018-12-03T06:00:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"47154ece83f14a2a5dfdb3f8cc946484eddb0194","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5660/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5660/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5660/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/a8105337ddab757f03a88b04cccf1b30db4bee32","head":{"label":"asasvari:KAFKA-4544","ref":"KAFKA-4544","sha":"a8105337ddab757f03a88b04cccf1b30db4bee32","user":{"login":"asasvari","id":18190331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkwMzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18190331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari","html_url":"https://github.com/asasvari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121440999,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjE0NDA5OTk=","name":"kafka","full_name":"asasvari/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"asasvari","id":18190331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkwMzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18190331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari","html_url":"https://github.com/asasvari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asasvari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/asasvari/kafka","description":"Mirror

patch fixes the inconsistent handling of out of range errors in the replica fetcher. Previously we would raise a fatal error if the follower's offset is ahead of the leader's and unclean leader election is not enabled. The behavior was inconsistent depending on the message format. With KIP-101/KIP-279 and the new message format, upon becoming a follower, the replica would use leader epoch information to reconcile the end of the log with the leader and simply truncate. Additionally, with the old format, the check is not really bulletproof for detecting data loss since the unclean leader's end offset might have already caught up to the follower's offset at the time of its initial fetch or when it queries for the current log end offset.\r\n\r\nWith this patch, we simply skip the unclean leader election check and allow the needed truncation to occur. When the truncation offset is below the high watermark, a warning will be logged.
