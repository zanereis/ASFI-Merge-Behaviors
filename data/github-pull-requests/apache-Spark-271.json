What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n*From Spark [JIRA ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25678):*  \r\n  \r\n[PBS (Portable Batch System) Professional](https://github.com/pbspro/pbspro) is an open sourced workload management system for HPC clusters. Many organizations using PBS for managing their cluster also use Spark for Big Data but they are forced to divide the cluster into Spark cluster and PBS cluster either physically dividing the cluster nodes into two groups or starting Spark Standalone cluster manager's Master and Slaves as PBS jobs, leading to underutilization of resources.\r\n\r\nI am trying to add support in Spark to use PBS as a pluggable cluster manager. Going through the Spark codebase and looking at Mesos and Kubernetes integration, I found that we can get this working as follows:\r\n\r\n- Extend `ExternalClusterManager`.\r\n- Extend `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend`\r\n  - This class can start `Executors` as PBS jobs.\r\n  - The initial number of `Executors` are started `onStart`.\r\n  - More `Executors` can be started as and when required using `doRequestTotalExecutors`.\r\n  - `Executors` can be killed using `doKillExecutors`.\r\n- Extend `SparkApplication` to start `Driver` as a PBS job in cluster deploy mode.\r\n  - This extended class can submit the Spark application again as a PBS job with deploy mode = client, so that the application driver is started on a node in the cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n- Compiled with PBS support by sending `-Ppbs` flag to `build/mvn`.\r\n- I was able to run a basic `SparkPi`Java application with client and cluster deploy modes using `bin/spark-submit`:\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/spark-submit --master pbs --deploy-mode cluster --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi spark-examples.jar 1000000\r\n```\r\n- The TravisCI build seems to fail because of code lint/license comments\r\n\r\n\r\n## I have a couple of questions:\r\n\r\n- Does this seem like a good idea to do this or should we look at other options?\r\n- What are the expectations from the initial prototype?\r\n- Would Spark maintainers look forward to merging this or would they want it to be maintained as a fork?\r\n\r\nCC:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExtractors are made of 2 expressions, one of them defines the the value to be extract from (called `child`) and the other defines the way of extraction (called `extraction`). In this term extractors have 2 children so they shouldn't be `UnaryExpression`s.\r\n\r\n`ResolveReferences` was changed in this commit: https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/36b826f5d17ae7be89135cb2c43ff797f9e7fe48 which resulted a regression with nested extractors. An extractor need to define its children as the set of both `child` and `extraction`; and should try to resolve both in `ResolveReferences`.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `UnresolvedExtractValue` to a `BinaryExpression`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere is a race condition when releasing a Python worker. If `ReaderIterator.handleEndOfDataSection` is not running in the task thread, when a task is early terminated (such as `take(N)`), the task completion listener may close the worker but \"handleEndOfDataSection\" can still put the worker into the worker pool to reuse.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zsxwing/spark/commit/0e07b483d2e7c68f3b5c3c118d0bf58c501041b7 is a patch to reproduce this issue.\r\n\r\nI also found a user reported this in the mail list: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/spark-user/201610.mbox/%3CCAAUq=H+YLUEpd23nwvq13Ms5hOStkhX3ao4f4zQV6sgO5zM-xA@mail.gmail.com%3E\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by using `compareAndSet` to make sure we will never return a closed worker to the work pool.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins.\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-24T17:23:38Z","updated_at":"2018-10-26T05:25:51Z","closed_at":"2018-10-26T04:58:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9bed9f0ce1463f0e70f4a34b9c2b9fa6615563bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22816/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22816/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22816/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2b0257ec79d7d45f0f1df24aab6a6ffa307a4bf2","head":{"label":"zsxwing:fix-socket-closed","ref":"fix-socket-closed","sha":"2b0257ec79d7d45f0f1df24aab6a6ffa307a4bf2","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":88661206,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4ODY2MTIwNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"zsxwing/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrent the function `from_avro` throws exception on reading corrupt records.\r\nIn practice, there could be various reasons of data corruption. It would be good to support `PERMISSIVE` mode and allow the function from_avro to process all the input file/streaming, which is consistent with from_json and from_csv. There is no obvious down side for supporting `PERMISSIVE` mode.\r\n\r\nDifferent from `from_csv` and `from_json`, the default parse mode is `FAILFAST` for the following reasons:\r\n1. Since Avro is structured data format, input data is usually able to be parsed by certain schema.  In such case, exposing the problems of input data to users is better than hiding it.\r\n2. For `PERMISSIVE` mode, we have to force the data schema as fully nullable. This seems quite unnecessary for Avro. Reversing non-null schema might archive more perf optimizations in Spark.\r\n3.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe cleanup mechanism will clear all the eligible directories under SPARK_WORK_DIR. If the other configured paths are the same as the SPARK_WORK_DIR configuration, this will cause the file directories of other configuration items to be deleted by mistake. For example, the SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS and SPARK_WORK_DIR settings are the same.\r\n\r\nWe should add an another condition which start with 'app-'  when removing the expired app-* directories  in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22745 , Dataset encoder supports the combination of java bean and map type. This PR is to fix the Scala side.\r\n\r\nThe reason why it didn't work before is, `CatalystToExternalMap` tries to get the data type of the input map expression, while it can be unresolved and its data type is known. To fix it, we can follow `UnresolvedMapObjects`, to create a `UnresolvedCatalystToExternalMap`, and only create `CatalystToExternalMap` when the input map expression is resolved and the data type is known.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nenable a old test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSince 0.11.0, PyArrow supports to raise an error for unsafe cast ([PR](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/2504)). We should use it to raise a proper error for pandas udf users when such cast is detected.\r\n\r\nAdded a SQL config `spark.sql.execution.pandas.arrowSafeTypeConversion` to disable Arrow safe type check.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test and manually

recently had a scenario where a race condition occurred when a task from previous stage attempt just finished before new attempt for the same stage was created due to fetch failure, so the new task created in the second attempt on the same partition id was retrying multiple times due to TaskCommitDenied Exception without realizing that the task in earlier attempt was already successful.  \r\n\r\nFor example, consider a task with partition id 9000 and index 9000 running in stage 4.0. We see a fetch failure so thus, we spawn a new stage attempt 4.1. Just within this timespan, the above task completes successfully, thus, marking the partition id 9000 as complete for 4.0. However, as stage 4.1 has not yet been created, the taskset info for that stage is not available to the TaskScheduler so, naturally, the partition id 9000 has not been marked completed for 4.1. Stage 4.1 now spawns task with index 2000 on the same partition id 9000. This task fails due to CommitDeniedException and since, it does not see the corresponding partition id as been marked successful, it keeps retrying multiple times until the job finally succeeds. It doesn't cause any job failures because the DAG scheduler is tracking the partitions separate from the task set managers.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-23433 tried to ensure that late task completions from a zombie taskset were properly updated in all tasksets for the stage (zombie or not). However, because it did this outside of the DAGScheduler event loop, the DAGScheduler could launch another taskset for the stage at the same time, before it had updated the set of tasks left to run. The new active taskset would never learn about the old completion from the zombie taskset. This could lead to multiple active tasksets (as described in SPARK-23433) or resultstage failure from repeated TaskCommitDenied exceptions for the task which the final stage attemps to re-run.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes it by duplicating that logic into the DAGScheduler event loop. So now, on completion of a task, we maintain a map of completed partitions to stage id's which we update from the DAGScheduler event loop. When any task fails in TSM, the TSM checks whether the corresponding partition is already complete by looking in the map and based on that, marks the corresponding partition as complete.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe screenshot for the bug is attached below:\r\n<img width=\"1412\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-10-23 at 2 49 29 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22228190/47386741-0ed3b880-d6d3-11e8-94f4-525516b553f8.png\">\r\n\r\nIn the above screenshot, you can see that for the partition id 17352, one of the task attempts in the previous stage succeeded so, for the current stage attempt, we get a TaskCommitDenied Exception each time and instead of killing the task, Spark keeps on retrying multiple times till the application exits.\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-23T14:35:18Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T18:56:32Z","closed_at":"2019-03-06T18:56:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"85b0f27d0914f505115efb4928c0c7078cff73b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22806/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22806/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22806/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/28017ed0e336fea9a9685a50d0db9c893c603c55","head":{"label":"pgandhi999:SPARK-25250","ref":"SPARK-25250","sha":"28017ed0e336fea9a9685a50d0db9c893c603c55","user":{"login":"pgandhi999","id":22228190,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjI4MTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22228190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999","html_url":"https://github.com/pgandhi999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":97985305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5Nzk4NTMwNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"pgandhi999/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pgandhi999","id":22228190,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjI4MTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22228190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999","html_url":"https://github.com/pgandhi999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgandhi999/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pgandhi999/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently K8S integration tests are hardcoded to use a `minikube` based backend.  `minikube` is VM based so can be resource hungry and also doesn't cope well with certain networking setups (for example using Cisco AnyConnect software VPN `minikube` is unusable as it detects its own IP incorrectly).\r\n\r\nThis PR Adds a new K8S integration testing backend that allows for using the Kubernetes support in [Docker for Desktop](https://blog.docker.com/2018/07/kubernetes-is-now-available-in-docker-desktop-stable-channel/).  It also generalises the framework to be able to run the integration tests against an arbitrary Kubernetes cluster.\r\n\r\nTo Do:\r\n\r\n- [x] General Kubernetes cluster backend\r\n- [x] Documentation on Kubernetes integration testing\r\n- [x] Testing of general K8S backend\r\n- [x] Check whether change from timestamps being `Time` to `String` in Fabric 8 upgrade needs additional fix up\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan integration tests with Docker for Desktop and all passed:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-23 at 14 19

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\ndocker-image-tool.sh uses getopts in which a colon signifies that an\r\noption takes an argument.  Since -n does not take an argument it\r\nshould not have a colon.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nFollowing the reproduction in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25803):-\r\n\r\n0. Created a custom Dockerfile to use for the spark-r container image.\r\nIn each of the steps below the path to this Dockerfile is passed with the '-R' option.\r\n(spark-r is used here simply as an example, the bug applies to all options)\r\n\r\n1. Built container images without '-n'.\r\nThe [result](https://gist.github.com/sel/59f0911bb1a6a485c2487cf7ca770f9d) is that the '-R' option is honoured and the hello-world image is built for spark-r, as expected.\r\n\r\n2. Built container images with '-n' to reproduce the issue\r\nThe [result](https://gist.github.com/sel/e5cabb9f3bdad5d087349e7fbed75141) is that the '-R' option is ignored and the default container image for spark-r is built\r\n\r\n3. Applied the patch and re-built container images with '-n' and did not reproduce the issue\r\nThe [result](https://gist.github.com/sel/6af14b95012ba8ff267a4fce6e3bd3bf) is that the '-R' option is honoured and the hello-world image is built for spark-r, as expected.\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-22T21:24:15Z","updated_at":"2018-10-25T20:49:45Z","closed_at":"2018-10-25T20:05:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dafaf659ee47d92c9f475e444a93d9cffff5345e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22798/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22798/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22798/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a07d105d27b7f73cf04af2c6711f8d64c3b5a843","head":{"label":"sel:fix-docker-image-tool-nocache","ref":"fix-docker-image-tool-nocache","sha":"a07d105d27b7f73cf04af2c6711f8d64c3b5a843","user":{"login":"sel","id":240965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel","html_url":"https://github.com/sel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":154197440,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTQxOTc0NDA=","name":"spark","full_name":"sel/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sel","id":240965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel","html_url":"https://github.com/sel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sel/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUsing `computeCost` for evaluating a model is a very poor approach. We should advice the users to a better approach which is available, ie. using the `ClusteringEvaluator` to evaluate their models.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe serializers of `RowEncoder` use few `If` Catalyst expression which inherits `ComplexTypeMergingExpression` that will check input data types.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to generate serializers which fail the check and can't to access the data type of serializers. When producing If expression, we should use the same data type at its input expressions.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark PCA supports maximum only ~65,535 columns matrix. This is due to the fact that, it computes the Covariance matrix first, then compute principle components. The main bottle neck was computing **covariance matrix.** The limit 65,500 came due to the integer size limit. Because we are passing an array of size n*(n+1)/2 to the breeze library and the size cannot be more than INT_MAX. so, the maximum column size we can give is 65,500.\r\n\r\nCurrently we don't have such limitation for computing SVD in spark.  So, we can make use of Spark SVD to compute the PCA, if the number of columns exceeds the limit.\r\n\r\nComputation of PCA can be done directly using SVD of matrix, instead of finding the covariance matrix.\r\nFollowing are the papers/links for the reference.\r\n\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.1100.pdf\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis#Singular_value_decomposition\r\nhttp://www.ifis.uni-luebeck.de/~moeller/Lectures/WS-16-17/Web-Mining-Agents/PCA-SVD.pdf\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nadded UT, also manually verified with the existing test for pca, by removing the limit condition in the fit method.\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-20T19:54:07Z","updated_at":"2018-10-30T14:36:19Z","closed_at":"2018-10-30T13:44:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"68499ceb1596f557ecb994072a259b0aa6dafa86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22784/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22784/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22784/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0effc85ccfc831bcc4c469b4a4c1d8db26fab72e","head":{"label":"shahidki31:PCA","ref":"PCA","sha":"0effc85ccfc831bcc4c469b4a4c1d8db26fab72e","user":{"login":"shahidki31","id":23054875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0ODc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23054875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31","html_url":"https://github.com/shahidki31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104183844,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxODM4NDQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"shahidki31/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shahidki31","id":23054875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0ODc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23054875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31","html_url":"https://github.com/shahidki31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahidki31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shahidki31/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen a job finishes, there may be some zombie tasks still running due to stage retry. Since a result stage will never be used by other jobs, running these tasks are just wasting the cluster resource. This PR just asks TaskScheduler to cancel the running tasks of a result stage when it's already finished. Credits go to @srinathshankar who suggested this idea to me.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes two minor issues while I'm touching DAGScheduler:\r\n- Invalid spark.job.interruptOnCancel should not crash DAGScheduler.\r\n- Non fatal errors should not crash DAGScheduler.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe new unit

Struct type of elements is inferred from java bean structure and ends up with mixed up field order.\r\nI used UnresolvedMapObjects instead of MapObjects, which allows to provide element type for MapObjects during analysis based on the resolved input data, not on the java bean.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test case.\r\nBuilt complete project on

PR is to backport #22708 to branch 2.3.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMapObjects expression is used to map array elements to java beans. Struct type of elements is inferred from java bean structure and ends up with mixed up field order.\r\nI used UnresolvedMapObjects instead of MapObjects, which allows to provide element type for MapObjects during analysis based on the resolved input data, not on the java bean.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test case.\r\nBuilt complete project on travis.\r\n\r\n@dongjoon-hyun

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWithout this PR some UDAFs like `GenericUDAFPercentileApprox` can throw an exception because expecting a constant parameter (object inspector) as a particular argument.\r\n\r\nThe exception is thrown because `toPrettySQL` call in `ResolveAliases` analyzer rule transforms a `Literal` parameter to a `PrettyAttribute` which is then transformed to an `ObjectInspector` instead of a `ConstantObjectInspector`.\r\nThe exception comes from `getEvaluator` method of `GenericUDAFPercentileApprox` that actually shouldn't be called during `toPrettySQL` transformation. The reason why it is called are the non lazy fields in `HiveUDAFFunction`.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes all fields of `HiveUDAFFunction` lazy.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpgrade netty dependency from 4.1.17 to 4.1.30.\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\nCurrently when sending a ChunkedByteBuffer with more than 16 chunks over the network will trigger a \"merge\" of all the blocks into one big transient array that is then sent over the network. This is problematic as the total memory for all chunks can be high (2GB) and this would then trigger an allocation of 2GB to merge everything, which will create OOM errors.\r\nAnd we can avoid this issue by upgrade the netty. https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8038\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual tests in some spark jobs.","created_at":"2018-10-18T11:21:04Z","updated_at":"2018-10-21T05:22:12Z","closed_at":"2018-10-21T05:22:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"32b2037e8c7f0696bd65fe6f51bad330d02768df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22765/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22765/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22765/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0753c0fe907070b50812b3fb40868dfcdb2bd969","head":{"label":"lipzhu:SPARK-25757","ref":"SPARK-25757","sha":"0753c0fe907070b50812b3fb40868dfcdb2bd969","user":{"login":"lipzhu","id":698621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5ODYyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/698621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu","html_url":"https://github.com/lipzhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":153439750,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTM0Mzk3NTA=","name":"spark","full_name":"lipzhu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lipzhu","id":698621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5ODYyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/698621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu","html_url":"https://github.com/lipzhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lipzhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lipzhu/spark","description":"Mirror

condition  \"if (table.stats.nonEmpty)\" in updateTableStats()  which will be executed as part of InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand command. since the CatalogTable stats never initialized, this condition never meets. so again if we fire same query in a new context/session the plan ll changed to SortMergeJoin.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12999161/47115820-58f50e00-d27d-11e8-97b0-ccee7c22bff5.png).\r\n\r\nSo as part of fix we initialized a default value for the CatalogTable stats if there is no cache of a particular LogicalRelation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs per this  statement after insert we are expecting the Hivestats shall get updated, please correct me if i am missing something. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested, attaching the snapshot.\r\n**After Fix**\r\nLogin to spark-shell => create 2 tables => Run insert commad => Explain the check the plan =>Plan contains Broadcast join => Exit\r\n\r\n![step-1-afterfix-spark-25332](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12999161/47113323-52af6380-d276-11e8-9eb9-71d1076d7e38.PNG)\r\n\r\nStep 2:\r\nRelaunch Spark-shell => Run explain command of particular select statement => verify the plan => Plan still contains Broadcast join since after fix Hivestats is available for the table.\r\n![step-2-afterfix-spark-25332](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12999161/47113407-94400e80-d276-11e8-99c1-66fa0c333beb.PNG)\r\n\r\nStep 3:\r\nAgain Run insert command => Run explain command of particular select statement => verify the plan\r\nwe can observer the plan still retains BroadcastJoin - Nowonwards the results are always consistent\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-17T20:49:38Z","updated_at":"2020-01-05T00:33:15Z","closed_at":"2020-01-05T00:33:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"10287bb217af99b502e53a2596cf6403767def0a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22758/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22758/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22758/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1d5902ec62918ec85ca7842fa2ef08dc94f42568","head":{"label":"sujith71955:master_statistics","ref":"master_statistics","sha":"1d5902ec62918ec85ca7842fa2ef08dc94f42568","user":{"login":"sujith71955","id":12999161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTk5MTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12999161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955","html_url":"https://github.com/sujith71955","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79292929,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3OTI5MjkyOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sujith71955/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sujith71955","id":12999161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTk5MTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12999161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955","html_url":"https://github.com/sujith71955","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sujith71955/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`hsync` has been added as part of SPARK-19531 to get the latest data in the history sever ui, but that is causing the performance overhead and also leading to drop many history log events. `hsync` uses the force `FileChannel.force` to sync the data to the disk and happens for the data pipeline, it is costly operation and making the application to face overhead and drop the events.\r\n\r\nI think getting the latest data in history server can be done in different way (no impact to application while writing events), there is an api `DFSInputStream.getFileLength()` which gives the file length including the `lastBlockBeingWrittenLength`(different from `FileStatus.getLen()`), this api can be used when the file status length and previously cached length are equal to verify whether any new data has been written or not, if there is any update in data length then the history server can update the in progress history log. And also I made this change as configurable with the default value false, and can be enabled for history server if users want to see the updated data in ui.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

test fix is to allocate a `Resource` object only after the resource\r\ntypes have been initialized.

for a null resource since that seems unnecessary\r\nand made the fix more complicated.\r\n\r\nAll the other changes are just cleanup; basically simplify the tests by\r\ndefining what is being tested

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`needsUnsafeRowConversion` is used in 2 places:\r\n1. `ColumnarBatchScan.produceRows`\r\n2. `FileSourceScanExec.doExecute`\r\n\r\nWhen we hit `ColumnarBatchScan.produceRows`, it means whole stage codegen is on but the vectorized reader is off. The vectorized reader can be off for several reasons:\r\n1. the file format doesn't have a vectorized reader(json, csv, etc.)\r\n2. the vectorized reader config is off\r\n3. the schema is not supported\r\n\r\nAnyway when the vectorized reader is off, file format reader will always return unsafe rows, and other `ColumnarBatchScan` implementations also always return unsafe rows, so `ColumnarBatchScan.needsUnsafeRowConversion` is not needed.\r\n\r\nWhen we hit `FileSourceScanExec.doExecute`, it means whole stage codegen is off. For this case, we need the `needsUnsafeRowConversion` to convert `ColumnarRow` to `UnsafeRow`, if the file format reader returns batch.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes `ColumnarBatchScan.needsUnsafeRowConversion`, and keep this flag only in `FileSourceScanExec`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting tests\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-16T16:05:47Z","updated_at":"2018-10-21T00:49:45Z","closed_at":"2018-10-21T00:49:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f9f6e6b5d861ba9dc32f565430dc09096bd716d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22750/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22750/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22750/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0dae5723e815bd8c49982530068aa3d45187bfde","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:minor","ref":"minor","sha":"0dae5723e815bd8c49982530068aa3d45187bfde","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is inspired during implementing #21732. For now `ScalaReflection` needs to consider how `ExpressionEncoder` uses generated serializers and deserializers. And `ExpressionEncoder` has a weird `flat` flag. After discussion with @cloud-fan, it seems to be better to refactor `ExpressionEncoder`. It should make SPARK-24762 easier to do.\r\n\r\nTo summarize the proposed changes:\r\n\r\n1. `serializerFor` and `deserializerFor` return expressions for serializing/deserializing an input expression for a given type. They are private and should not be called directly.\r\n2. `serializerForType` and `deserializerForType` returns an expression for serializing/deserializing for an object of type T to/from Spark SQL representation. It assumes the input object/Spark SQL representation is located at ordinal 0 of a row.\r\n\r\nSo in other words, `serializerForType` and `deserializerForType` return expressions for atomically serializing/deserializing JVM object to/from Spark SQL value.\r\n\r\nA serializer returned by `serializerForType` will serialize an object at `row(0)` to a corresponding Spark SQL representation, e.g. primitive type, array, map, struct.\r\n\r\nA deserializer returned by `deserializerForType` will deserialize an input field at `row(0)` to an object with given type.\r\n\r\n3. The construction of `ExpressionEncoder` takes a pair of serializer and deserializer for type `T`. It uses them to create serializer and deserializer for T <-> row serialization. Now `ExpressionEncoder` dones't need to remember if serializer is flat or not. When we need to construct new `ExpressionEncoder` based on existing ones, we only need to change input location in the atomic serializer and deserializer.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2018-10-16T15:30:10Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:22:02Z","closed_at":"2018-10-25T11:32:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1f1ad5b6c3fae91c8754a763ff8f9d6537830dd6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22749/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22749/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22749/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c00d5e44a21f8053a97db755f7a705872d4121eb","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-24762-refactor","ref":"SPARK-24762-refactor","sha":"c00d5e44a21f8053a97db755f7a705872d4121eb","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds error checking and handling to `docker` invocations ensuring the script terminates early in the event of any errors.  This avoids subtle errors that can occur e.g. if the base image fails to build the Python/R images can end up being built from outdated base images and makes it more explicit to the user that something went wrong.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the provided `Dockerfiles` assume that Spark was first built locally or is a runnable distribution however it didn't previously enforce this.  The script will now check the JARs folder to ensure that Spark JARs actually exist and if not aborts early reminding the user they need to build locally first.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Tested with a `mvn clean` working copy and verified that the script now terminates early\r\n- Tested with bad `Dockerfiles` that fail to build to see that early termination occurred","created_at":"2018-10-16T12:55:57Z","updated_at":"2018-10-31T11:15:55Z","closed_at":"2018-10-19T22:08:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a660f0ae9c01c433296defbb6af8955b23c89464","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22748/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22748/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22748/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a9516f03bb138be09734ef35fd934f41c16bbff5","head":{"label":"rvesse:SPARK-25745","ref":"SPARK-25745","sha":"a9516f03bb138be09734ef35fd934f41c16bbff5","user":{"login":"rvesse","id":2104864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDQ4NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2104864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse","html_url":"https://github.com/rvesse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29888493,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTg4ODQ5Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"rvesse/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rvesse","id":2104864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDQ4NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2104864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse","html_url":"https://github.com/rvesse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rvesse/spark","description":"Mirror

is a follow-up PR for #22708. It considers another case of java beans deserialization: java maps with struct keys/values.\r\n\r\nWhen deserializing values of MapType with struct keys/values in java beans, fields of structs get mixed up. I suggest using struct data types retrieved from resolved input data instead of inferring them from java beans.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nInvocations of \"keyArray\" and \"valueArray\" functions are used to extract arrays of keys and values. Struct type of keys or values is also inferred from java bean structure and ends up with mixed up field order.\r\nI created a new UnresolvedInvoke expression as a temporary substitution of Invoke expression while no actual data is available. It allows to provide the resulting data type during analysis based on the resolved input data, not on the java bean (similar to UnresolvedMapObjects).\r\n\r\nKey and value arrays are then fed to MapObjects expression which I replaced with UnresolvedMapObjects, just like in case of ArrayType.\r\n\r\nFinally I added resolution of UnresolvedInvoke expressions in Analyzer.resolveExpression method as an additional pattern matching case.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test case.\r\nBuilt complete project on travis.\r\n\r\n@viirya @kiszk @cloud-fan @michalsenkyr @marmbrus

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up PR for #22259. The extra field added in `ScalaUDF` with the original PR was declared optional, but should be indeed required, otherwise callers of `ScalaUDF`'s constructor could ignore this new field and cause the result to be incorrect. This PR makes the new field required and changes its name to `handleNullForInputs`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also restores the original behavior for null-handling of primitive-type input parameters, which was broken by #22259. For example, for `val f = udf({(x: Int, y: Any) => x})`, `f(null, \"str\")` should return `null` but would return `0` after #22259.\r\n\r\nIn addition, now that we have this extra field indicating if
