I am so sorry @LIU-WEI-git @jixuan1989 I have to initialize this **revert** due to our recent performance testing result.\r\n\r\nHere are the graphs of SkyWalking OAP server so11y(self-obsevability) result.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5441976/143798527-5e0f38a7-379b-4d03-8f38-38b901ad57d2.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5441976/143798529-6eb48e02-38f8-481e-a148-59c77eec26a6.png)\r\n\r\nBefore 9:45, the OAP includes the pull request of IoTDB storage implementation, you can see that, it provides much lower performance than it should be(after 9:45). The analysis capability drops from `30+k/s` to `< 10k/s`, which is hard to believe.\r\n\r\nBoth of these testing are running in new deployed environment, most importantly, IoTDB storage option is even **NEVER ACTIVATED**, which could only provide one possibility, the packages(jars) we introduced have clear conflicts and performance impact to SkyWalking server. \r\nThis is the first time I see this happened, which surprised me too. But tests verified this repeatedly. So I am submitting this pull request, and will ask @mrproliu to verify again according this branch.","created_at":"2021-11-29T02:21:32Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T09:18:49Z","closed_at":"2021-11-29T04:10:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"17c48bfda014e159f7df088b87b5f58d5f570ffa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mrproliu","id":3417650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTc2NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3417650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu","html_url":"https://github.com/mrproliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":830850453,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzA4NTA0NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/backend","name":"backend","color":"54ceff","default":false,"description":"OAP

am working on improving the performance of transparent message transmission for the [skywalking-satellite](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-satellite) project.\r\n\r\nThen I realize the  ALS protocol needed to operate the stream on each identity stream message. The satellite needs more resources and time. This is especially true when envoys are high in number. \r\n\r\nHere is a performance test, using `2300` envoy instances are used to transparently transmit ALS messages to OAP through satellite, at a rate of `2.3K+` QPS. Then the satellite memory is full and not stable.\r\n\r\nsatellite so11y:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3417650/143766374-75714a27-cfd1-4fb7-983a-b17e02e51e37.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3417650/143766386-9c6cc432-7256-41e3-9ffe-5c51ea88d196.png)\r\n\r\nOAP so11y(cluster):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3417650/143766407-854561ed-3ca8-41c8-a5df-460a10ecec5c.png)\r\n\r\nI have tried to cache the stream on the satellite side, but more resources are wasted due to resource preemption. So I think we could dependency on the gRPC streaming messages are order feature, using the same stream to send cross identity messages. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I did a test in this way, and the efficiency of sending ALS messages to OAP was improved, and the memory queue of the satellite was more stable.\r\n\r\nThis new protocol is copied from ALS and will only be called by the satellite.\r\n\r\nHere have some screenshots to see the effect after optimization. Here, `2300` envoy instances are used to transparently transmit ALS messages to OAP through satellite, at a rate of `120K+` QPS. The ALS message tab is read from the `oap`, `envoy_als_in_count` metric. \r\n\r\nsatellite

to the latest grpc-java 1.42.1 which is only compatible and [tested against](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/8551#discussion_r714182190) 3.17.2, but we can assume that 3.17.3 (which has osx-aarch_64 compatible maven artifacts) is save to use.\r\n\r\nWe could have also upgrade to the latest grpc-java 1.42.1 and latest protoc 3.19.1, but it can not be directly done, it needs to tweak the grpcs-java internal dependencies. So we choose the safest option and discarded this option because of the following reasons:\r\n - Protoc 3.19.1 generates code that relies on methods not available in protobuf-java 3.17.2 ([“issue”](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9236#issue-1059594027)) (which java-grpc relies on). So we need to tell grpc-java via dependency management to use 3.19.1 instead of 3.17.2.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    ⚠️ Please make sure to read this template first, pull requests that don't accord with this template\r\n    maybe closed without notice.\r\n    Texts surrounded by `<` and `>` are meant to be replaced by you, e.g. <framework name>, <issue number>.\r\n    Put an `x` in the `[ ]` to mark the item as CHECKED. `[x]`\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- ==== 🐛 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're fixing a bug, follow the checklist 👇 ====\r\n### Fix <bug description or the bug issue number or bug issue link>\r\n- [ ] Add a unit test to verify that the fix works.\r\n- [ ] Explain briefly why the bug exists and how to fix it.\r\n     ==== 🐛 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're fixing a bug, follow the checklist 👆 ==== -->\r\n\r\n<!-- ==== 📈 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're improving the performance, follow the checklist 👇 ====\r\n### Improve the performance of <class or module or ...>\r\n- [ ] Add a benchmark for the improvement, refer to [the existing ones](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/apm-commons/apm-datacarrier/src/test/java/org/apache/skywalking/apm/commons/datacarrier/LinkedArrayBenchmark.java)\r\n- [ ] The benchmark result.\r\n```text\r\n<Paste the benchmark results here>\r\n```\r\n- [ ] Links/URLs to the theory proof or discussion articles/blogs. <links/URLs here>\r\n     ==== 📈 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're improving the performance, follow the checklist 👆 ==== -->\r\n\r\n<!-- ==== 🆕 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're adding a new feature, follow the checklist 👇 ====\r\n### <Feature description>\r\n- [ ] If this is non-trivial feature, paste the links/URLs to the design doc.\r\n- [ ] Update the documentation to include this new feature.\r\n- [ ] Tests(including UT, IT, E2E) are added to verify the new feature.\r\n- [ ] If it's UI related, attach the screenshots below.\r\n     ==== 🆕 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're adding a new feature, follow the checklist 👆 ==== -->\r\n\r\n- [x] If this pull request closes/resolves/fixes an existing issue, replace the issue number.

found out the reason why there is no conflict between Istio and so11y in https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/8157#discussion_r753153239 is the `istio-controlplane.yaml` has already filter the metrics by tag `app == istiod`, and since we also have filter for so11y since https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/8157, I think we can safely remove the filter in `istio-controlplane.yaml` so that the users don't bother to check the job name in OTEL and the filter name in our file `istio-controlplane.yaml`, which reduce extra work and confusion if users found there is no data on UI, just because of the names' not matching.\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-21T11:26:14Z","updated_at":"2021-11-21T12:05:09Z","closed_at":"2021-11-21T12:04:54Z","merged_at":"2021-11-21T12:04:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"7b2d91a3d7e8925794573038f971472500f4ddc8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":830850453,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzA4NTA0NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/backend","name":"backend","color":"54ceff","default":false,"description":"OAP
