Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue with BeamFnLoggingClient is that we can't arriveAndDeregister during termination since\r\nthe onReadyHandler may also arrive at the same time which is why we swap to using forced termination.\r\nAlso, I added code that would guarantee that log messages produced by the thread which is shutting\r\ndown are guaranteed to make it (this was being caught occassionally by the testLogging test).\r\n\r\nThe BufferingStreamObserver was incorrectly shutting down since it may attempt to enqueue something\r\ninto a full queue with a reading thread that has already exitted for some reason so it would loop\r\nforever attempting to insert the poison pill.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-13T16:41:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-16T23:33:17Z","closed_at":"2017-10-16T23:33:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bed469e1cd3fc062d94fd44a201b220117aff787","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3992/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3992/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3992/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/9dd1c5be1c79de55a49e827e8cd9d2418a9a55b8","head":{"label":"lukecwik:master","ref":"master","sha":"9dd1c5be1c79de55a49e827e8cd9d2418a9a55b8","user":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52895685,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1Mjg5NTY4NQ==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"lukecwik/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-13T07:03:58Z","updated_at":"2017-11-03T22:26:10Z","closed_at":"2017-11-03T22:26:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ce809d7d8c482c0697ff9aae285326eabbb4ca8e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3991/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3991/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3991/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/efb8f8176fbd68716d0edc35d79b87ee212ff237","head":{"label":"arnaudfnr:HyperLogLog_sketch","ref":"HyperLogLog_sketch","sha":"efb8f8176fbd68716d0edc35d79b87ee212ff237","user":{"login":"arnaudfnr","id":12599044,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTk5MDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12599044?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr","html_url":"https://github.com/arnaudfnr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94881028,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDg4MTAyOA==","name":"beam","full_name":"arnaudfnr/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arnaudfnr","id":12599044,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTk5MDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12599044?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr","html_url":"https://github.com/arnaudfnr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudfnr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arnaudfnr/beam","description":"Mirror of Apache Beam.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is necessary in order to consume new v1b3 fields in the Dataflow

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI noticed this branch sitting around and tests seem to pass for me.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis allows the Job Server to point the client at the appropriate\r\nendpoint without having to have any foreknowledge in the

a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

[JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-10T18:07:29Z","updated_at":"2017-11-07T17:54:44Z","closed_at":"2017-10-31T22:08:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5abeef283d67593c4014c3d17c35d4554daf0e64","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3969/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3969/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3969/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/504004d4cd3bfa745d6e175aaca0564c2e6d5c74","head":{"label":"nerdynick:BEAM-2257","ref":"BEAM-2257","sha":"504004d4cd3bfa745d6e175aaca0564c2e6d5c74","user":{"login":"nerdynick","id":117746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzc0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/117746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick","html_url":"https://github.com/nerdynick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":106439025,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDY0MzkwMjU=","name":"beam","full_name":"nerdynick/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nerdynick","id":117746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzc0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/117746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick","html_url":"https://github.com/nerdynick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdynick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nerdynick/beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nR: @aviemzur (since you mentioned how broken things are, sending things to you)\r\n\r\nI think the nightly build - misnamed, since it isn't night for everyone - should gather all the failures.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nR: @tgroh

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe last successful nightly build was Sept 17, and it took 89 minutes. Since then, we have had test failures but we also know that the build time has increased to exceed the 100 minute timeout. For the nightly build, we should have very liberal timeouts since it builds everything and does additional work. And anyhow if it takes a long time to push a working snapshot, that is OK.","created_at":"2017-10-09T16:29:13Z","updated_at":"2017-10-23T22:18:26Z","closed_at":"2017-10-09T17:34:50Z","merged_at":"2017-10-09T17:34:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"742a082302d328ed0c6a20c611d7ddf8da64c272","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3963/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3963/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3963/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/742a082302d328ed0c6a20c611d7ddf8da64c272","head":{"label":"kennknowles:super-long-nightly","ref":"super-long-nightly","sha":"742a082302d328ed0c6a20c611d7ddf8da64c272","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

[ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nR: @jasonkuster \r\nCC: @herohde you can do it for Go\r\nCC: @pabloem there was a little issue, JFYI this should keep the feature you added.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFollow up on this short-term splitting since we have timeouts here and I think they might be masking real issues. There's already a Python postcommit hook, though it runs a bash script which I haven't read over.\r\n\r\nR: @tgroh \r\nCC: @jasonkuster

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis PR adds the ability to use `AvroIO.write()` and related methods without specifying a schema. \r\nThe schema is determined at the first call of `AvroSink.write()`: the `DataFileWriter` is lazy initialized (at first write) once we have the value to get the schema from.  \r\nThis PR also makes the schema optional in `ConstantAvroDestination` and depreciate write methods that take schema as parameter. Tell me if I'm missing something that prevents deprecation of these methods.\r\n\r\nTo use `AvoIO.write()` with no schema, all the elements of the input PCollection must have the same schema, but it is the same with current AvroIO.write(schema) implementation because this schema instance is passed to the `TypedWrite` then to the `ConstantAvroDestination` that is used in `AvroSink`. Please tell me if I'm missing something here.\r\n\r\nMy only concern is with empty bundles, `AvroSink.write()` will not be called resulting in the `DataFileWriter` not being initialized.  \r\n\r\nPlease merge the PR bellow before this one because it is used as a base for the tests\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3948\r\n\r\nR: @jkff \r\nR: @reuvenlax \r\nCC: @lukecwik

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nR: @lukecwik

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n- Make runTestWrite() more generic to be able to use GenericRecord[] as input for writeGenericRecords test in place of AvroGeneratedUser\r\n- Make readAvroFile() generic to be able to read GenericRecords using GenericDatumReader for writeGenericRecords test\r\nR: @jkff

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-04T20:59:23Z","updated_at":"2017-10-13T21:41:44Z","closed_at":"2017-10-13T21:41:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"011836c62e454566b64fa5d22f58021fbd59f574","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3941/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3941/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3941/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/b0a1743e883f5be8284d06de678474b3c29fd502","head":{"label":"robertwb:runner-harness-fixes","ref":"runner-harness-fixes","sha":"b0a1743e883f5be8284d06de678474b3c29fd502","user":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54749372,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDc0OTM3Mg==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"robertwb/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

This pull request adds the ability to extract timestamps from Pubsub message bodies. \r\nWhy: Currently an attribute name containing timestamps can be provided, but in the case where message publisher isn't controlled by the user, correct windowing requires a way to pull timestamps from the message payload.\r\nHow: Instead of passing a timestamp attribute (String) through PubsubIO -> PubsubClient, this has been generalized to a PubsubTimestampExtractor which is instantiated 3 ways: \r\n1) empty constructor. This means the default publish time is used as the message timestamp\r\n2) with a String timestamp attribute name. This works the same as the current approach.\r\n3) with a Function<String, String> extractor. This function extractor takes in the message payload as a string, and returns the parsed timestamp. In the case the returned timestamp isn't a timestamp, an exception is thrown saying the timestamp cannot be interpreted (same behavior as when a timestamp attribute can't be interpreted as a timestamp)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-02T21:17:04Z","updated_at":"2017-10-20T19:42:47Z","closed_at":"2017-10-20T19:42:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c7e7dcfb6f1a4aef2e4db228a2d9f07d9886cf0a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3933/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3933/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3933/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/3585d78cbc67ef46d520011c487c1f957fe80888","head":{"label":"rniemo-g:pubsub-timestamp-extraction","ref":"pubsub-timestamp-extraction","sha":"3585d78cbc67ef46d520011c487c1f957fe80888","user":{"login":"rniemo-g","id":22622466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjIyNDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22622466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g","html_url":"https://github.com/rniemo-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105193555,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDUxOTM1NTU=","name":"beam","full_name":"rniemo-g/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rniemo-g","id":22622466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjIyNDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22622466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g","html_url":"https://github.com/rniemo-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rniemo-g/beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe Beam portability framework has a lot of simple pieces that can be modularized more usefully than \"Runner API\" and \"Fn API\".\r\n\r\nHere are some semantic categories that should remain stable, and make sense to depend on separately:\r\n\r\n - Modeling of a Pipeline and pieces of it\r\n - Standardized transform payloads\r\n   - primitives\r\n   - non-primitives\r\n   - execution-time only transforms\r\n - Standardized UDFs\r\n - Job submission and management (Job API)\r\n - Artifact upload and retrieval (Artifact API) (could separate upload and retrieval)\r\n - Model of bundle processing instructions (ProcessBundleDescriptor)\r\n - Standardized execution-only instruction payloads (like data plane read instructions)\r\n - Setting up the SDK harness (Provision API)\r\n - Control plane for bundle processing (FnControl)\r\n - Multi-purpose data streaming (FnData)\r\n - Logging\r\n - ... more later, maybe ...\r\n\r\nThis PR is a first move in this direction, organizing the components according to when in a pipeline's lifecycle they are used.\r\n\r\n - **Construction**: building a pipeline and specifying transforms. Basically just data structures, not APIs. Code doing this work should only depend on this module.\r\n - **Job**: submission and management of a pipeline, including artifacts, etc. Construction code should not depend on this module.\r\n - **Execution**: SDK harness management and UDF invocation. Only runner internals and SDK harnesses should depend on this module.\r\n\r\nWhat this PR does is move the existing protos into the right maven modules, but does not split them yet.\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-29T22:05:36Z","updated_at":"2017-10-23T22:18:19Z","closed_at":"2017-10-11T19:26:18Z","merged_at":"2017-10-11T19:26:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"b2daa0cf432eb81d3f9283b9239f164a60ff92e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3924/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3924/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3924/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/b2daa0cf432eb81d3f9283b9239f164a60ff92e1","head":{"label":"kennknowles:beam-model","ref":"beam-model","sha":"b2daa0cf432eb81d3f9283b9239f164a60ff92e1","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nR: @kennknowles \r\nCC: @sberyozkin \r\ntestReadPdfFile has been failing intermittently in PRs with nothing to do with TikaIO.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n`WithKeys` had trouble correctly getting a `VoidCoder` when called with a null input before. This fix makes it so that it now functions when the input is `(Void) null`. This is done by passing Void.class as the key's class type instead of null, if the inputted key was null. Note that a null input that isn't cast to Void calls the `WithKeys.of` taking a `SerializableFunction` instead, so I added a precondition with a warning message to that one.\r\n\r\nAlso added a unit test to confirm that the fix works as intended, a quick change to `VoidCoder` to ensure that it doesn't get used inappropriately, and fixed a few warnings in `WithKeysTest`.","created_at":"2017-09-29T21:19:21Z","updated_at":"2017-10-03T18:42:24Z","closed_at":"2017-10-03T18:42:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"926a9d3520bc16a6d617fe4694dce7518c5607a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3922/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3922/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3922/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/ff6ba356f7799876c60395820242726caa1d95fc","head":{"label":"youngoli:bug-2989","ref":"bug-2989","sha":"ff6ba356f7799876c60395820242726caa1d95fc","user":{"login":"youngoli","id":1740865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDA4NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1740865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli","html_url":"https://github.com/youngoli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":103320121,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDMzMjAxMjE=","name":"beam","full_name":"youngoli/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"youngoli","id":1740865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDA4NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1740865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli","html_url":"https://github.com/youngoli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/youngoli/beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThese are some basic refactors to give `PackageUtil` a little TLC, making it more usable and

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCreate a new pipeline job for Beam's Jenkins

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdding a string to PipelineOptions that can be used for setting a user agent string with information about the distribution of Beam being used.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-27T00:04:04Z","updated_at":"2018-06-25T15:19:38Z","closed_at":"2018-06-14T04:53:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9c7bd62d2f35c5a1917348d43f277989062cde99","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":974794430,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzQ3OTQ0MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3906/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3906/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3906/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/92ab60d9d93bb22d1b900a50b89cade411877e5c","head":{"label":"robertwb:errors","ref":"errors","sha":"92ab60d9d93bb22d1b900a50b89cade411877e5c","user":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54749372,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDc0OTM3Mg==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"robertwb/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-25T19:14:28Z","updated_at":"2017-09-28T22:41:14Z","closed_at":"2017-09-28T21:38:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"02e2513ee702a51828a99e150302a71dbb14f0d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3897/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3897/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3897/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/888cfd50c17c28c88ccd41c132fab528fac51d27","head":{"label":"tc-dc:bigtable-disable-validation","ref":"bigtable-disable-validation","sha":"888cfd50c17c28c88ccd41c132fab528fac51d27","user":{"login":"tc-dc","id":23220554,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIzMjIwNTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23220554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc","html_url":"https://github.com/tc-dc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":90903122,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MDkwMzEyMg==","name":"beam","full_name":"tc-dc/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tc-dc","id":23220554,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIzMjIwNTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23220554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc","html_url":"https://github.com/tc-dc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tc-dc/beam","description":"Mirror
