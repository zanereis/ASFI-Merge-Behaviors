PR fixes a shape inference bug in function `InferAttr`.\r\nConsider the following network:\r\n```\r\nweight --> abs_op --> sum_op \r\n       \\                    \\ \r\n        \\                     add_op\r\n         \\                  /\r\ndata   --> fc_op --> sum_op\r\n```\r\nGiven a data shape, if the shape forward inference starts from weight, there would be several node entries with unknown shapes for  abs_op and sum_op in the first pass. The weight shape is only known after fc_op's shape inference is done. When the backward shape inference starts, it assumes that all forward node entries' shapes are known. However, this is not true in this case and therefore, leads to `CHECK_EQ` failure.\r\n\r\nThe problem is fixed by skipping `CHECK_EQ` for empty shapes in the backward shape inference.\r\n\r\n@piiswrong @eric-haibin-lin

following file is the result of solving build issues for the entire codebase that arise after setting MSHADOW_USE_CBLAS=0 in mshadow/make/mshadow.mk.  Problems were often that cpu versions of the linalg interface were missing at final link-time, and this PR supplies stubs that log a fatal message that the routine is unimplemented.  In addition, I reworked the linalg_gemm<cpu, DType> specialization to be more consistent with the rest of the file- a '#define' that is instantiated with float and double types.  This clearly supplies a full function specialization (avoiding the partial function specialization error reported against an earlier version of the file by @chinakook).  Also, I personally find the existing implementation of a routine that is templated on ```<xpu>```, yet never refers to ```xpu```, as confusing.  Again, this PR offers a simple approach consistent with the rest of the file. @piiswrong @yajiedesign @asmushetzel

What're included:\r\n1. Added **contrib.py**, **linalg.py**, and **random.py** under the folders **python/mxnet/ndarray** and **python/mxnet/symbol** for registering ops of those categories.\r\n2. Consolidated op registration functions: [_init_ndarray_module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/ndarray/op.py#L174) and [_init_symbol_module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/symbol/op.py#L206) into a single one [_init_op_module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/compare/master...reminisce:refactor_random_linalg_contrib_namespaces?expand=1#diff-bdc88d735b5304ea6d327d5c0144b6efR381) in python/mxnet/base.py. In the future, if there are more submodules added under mxnet.ndarray and mxnet.symbol, we just need to add the prefix name in [_OP_NAME_PREFIX_LIST](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/7604/files#diff-bdc88d735b5304ea6d327d5c0144b6efR366) without modifying the op registration function itself.\r\n3. Changed to register all regular backend ops (not any kind of contrib, linalg, random, or sparse) under **ndarray/op.py** and **symbol/op.py** for clearer op ownership management. Imported all registered op in **ndarray/__init__.py** and **symbol/__init__.py**. Thank @szha for discussion and his PR: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/7584.\r\n4. Changed to use the new namespace ops in all unit tests and examples.\r\n5. Changed [`stype` comparison](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/7604/files#diff-966da4762e41c3d42821d8b2f82416a4R836) from string to int for internal functions. (suggested by @piiswrong )\r\n\r\n### The ops under the newly added namespaces:\r\n```python\r\n>>> import mxnet as mx\r\n>>> dir(mx.nd.contrib)\r\n['CTCLoss', 'DeformableConvolution', 'DeformablePSROIPooling', 'MultiBoxDetection', 'MultiBoxPrior', 'MultiBoxTarget', 'MultiProposal', 'PSROIPooling', 'Proposal',..., 'count_sketch', 'ctc_loss', 'dequantize', 'fft', 'ifft', 'quantize']\r\n>>> dir(mx.sym.contrib)\r\n['CTCLoss', 'DeformableConvolution', 'DeformablePSROIPooling', 'MultiBoxDetection', 'MultiBoxPrior', 'MultiBoxTarget', 'MultiProposal', 'PSROIPooling', 'Proposal',..., 'count_sketch', 'ctc_loss', 'dequantize', 'fft', 'ifft', 'quantize']\r\n>>> dir(mx.nd.random)\r\n[..., 'exponential', 'gamma', 'generalized_negative_binomial', 'negative_binomial', 'normal', 'poisson', 'uniform']\r\n>>> dir(mx.sym.random)\r\n[..., 'exponential', 'gamma', 'generalized_negative_binomial', 'negative_binomial', 'normal', 'poisson', 'uniform']\r\n>>> dir(mx.nd.linalg)\r\n[..., 'gemm', 'gemm2', 'potrf', 'potri', 'sumlogdiag', 'trmm', 'trsm']\r\n>>> dir(mx.sym.linalg)\r\n[..., 'gemm', 'gemm2', 'potrf', 'potri', 'sumlogdiag', 'trmm', 'trsm']\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The following two namespaces are kept for backward compatibility.\r\n```python\r\n>>> dir(mx.contrib.sym)\r\n['CTCLoss', 'DeformableConvolution', 'DeformablePSROIPooling', 'MultiBoxDetection', 'MultiBoxPrior', 'MultiBoxTarget', 'MultiProposal', 'PSROIPooling', 'Proposal',..., 'count_sketch', 'ctc_loss', 'dequantize', 'fft', 'ifft', 'quantize']\r\n>>>

can override the Makefile's setting of CUDA_ARCH with their own value, but then they may think they can revert back to the default setting by leaving a line such as \"CUDA_ARCH=\" in their custom config.mk.  A defined, but null, CUDA_ARCH variable caused the platform to compile for all NVIDIA GPU architectures, including unsupported ones like Fermi.  This PR changes the behavior so that a null CUDA_ARCH is treated the same as an undefined one- the platform is compiled to the list of supported GPU architectures in the Makefile.","created_at":"2017-08-18T01:45:33Z","updated_at":"2017-08-18T04:14:18Z","closed_at":"2017-08-18T04:14:18Z","merged_at":"2017-08-18T04:14:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"56eae588c097f12035356333b742489d8cf0eaae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/7515/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/7515/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7515/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/31e8df12b673577d0024949ea63d8a2f9fb835aa","head":{"label":"DickJC123:makefile_null_CUDA_ARCH","ref":"makefile_null_CUDA_ARCH","sha":"31e8df12b673577d0024949ea63d8a2f9fb835aa","user":{"login":"DickJC123","id":1703397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123","html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86116214,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjExNjIxNA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"DickJC123/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DickJC123","id":1703397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123","html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,
