GHCR change, github image caching for python images was\r\nbroken. GHCR requires each image that we push to it to be\r\ntagged with \"org.opencontainers.image.source\" label to point\r\nto the right project repository. Otherwise it will not appear\r\nin the repository images and we will not be able to manage\r\npermissions of the image.\r\n\r\nSo we'v been extending the python base image with appropriate\r\nlabel, but it was not in all places necessary. As the result.\r\nthe builds in CI were usign different images than the cache\r\nimage in DockerHub, which in turn caused full image rebuilds\r\nALWAYS. By implementing this change we make sure tha the the\r\n\"airflow-tainted\" python images - including the label.\r\n\r\nAll images (when using breeze) are now built using such\r\nairflow-tainted image which in turn should give5 up to 5-8\r\nminutes saving on building the images job per each job (CI\r\nand production)\r\n\r\nThe change implements the following behaviours:\r\n\r\n1) When image is built on CI or locally without\r\n   UPGRADE_TO_NEWER_DEPENDENCIES flag and without\r\n   FORCE_PULL_IMAGES flag -t the latest image from the\r\n   GitHub Registry or DockerHub registry is used.\r\n\r\n2) When both FORCE_PULL_IMAGES and UPGRADE_TO_NEWER_DEPENDENCY\r\n   are set to something different than \"false\" - the latest Python\r\n   images are used - they are pulled first and tagged appropriately.\r\n\r\nThis way - always when UPGRADE_TO_NEWER_DEPENDENCIES are set (also\r\nwhen master pushes are done) - such builds will use latest version\r\nof python base images published on DockerHub.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

change attempts to stabilize pylint checks. Since we have\r\nrecently added self-hosted runners with multiple CPUS, seems that\r\nre-enabling parallel mode for pylint makes perfect sense as we will\r\nfinally be able to use the parallelism and speed up static checks\r\nsignificantly.\r\n\r\nPreviously the tests were run in single-processor mode in attempt\r\nto avoid random mistakes where different files were processed in\r\ndifferent processes. This led to random pylint or mypy problems\r\nand aither false-positives or false negatives before especially\r\nwhen it came to circular dependencies. but since we are now past\r\nheavy refactoring, this should be no problem for future changes\r\nand occasional false positive/negative is less disruptive than\r\nlong checks.\r\n\r\nThe attempt is made to apply sorting order in the files passed\r\nto pylint. This should provide more stability in the results\r\nof running the tests in PR and in master.\r\n\r\nWe had some custom pylint plugins that prevented using of pylint\r\nparallelism. For now we are giving up on one of the plugins\r\n(no asserts use) and we rely on committer's review on that (we\r\nhave a rule in place to only use asserts in tests). The other\r\nplugin was replaced by coming back to separation of \"main code\"\r\nand \"test code\" and applying different rules to those - we have\r\nnow two different configuration files|: pylintrc and\r\npylintrc-tests to control settings for those two different cases.\r\n\r\nMypy and flake8 have been parallelized at the level of pre-commits.\r\n\r\nBy implementing those changes we are likely to speed up the\r\ntests on self-hosted runners 6x-8x times.\r\n\r\nAlso caching of pre-commit environments (including the\r\npre-commit installation) is improved. Previously we only cached the\r\nenvironment created by the pre-commit, but with this change we\r\nalso cache the pre-commit installation in .local directory - this\r\nshould save 1-2 minutes of the job.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

instances would not be terminated when dagrun_timeout is exceeded which allowed new DAG runs to be created, but task instances within the new DAGs would never be instantiated. As alluded to in #13407, the query to determine if a DAG is active is based on [task instances being unfinished](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py#L1502-L1512). Since task instances were not being set to a `State.finished` state when their DAG run was set to `FAILED` state, the scheduler continued to pick up the DAG as `RUNNING`, and tasks in new DAG runs would never be scheduled.\r\n\r\ncloses: #12912\r\nrelated:

noticed that the `/dags` endpoint returns information on all entries in the DAG table, which is often many more DAGs than are activeand likely includes DAGs which have been removed from Airflow. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a boolean `only_active` parameter to the `/dags` endpoint which will then only return active DAGs. \r\n\r\nI also noticed that this endpoint was hitting a deprecated codepath by dumping a `DAG` object to the DAGDetailSchema, thus hitting calling `DAG.is_paused()` I have updated the schema to call the correct function (`DAG.get_is_paused`) since I'm assuming the deprecated functions may be removed some day.

#14262, and do additional minor improvement.\r\n\r\n- Fix the issue in #14262 . The issue arose because MySQL version may include special suffix like \"-log\" ([reference](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_version)), which is not accepted by `packaging.version.Version()`. A special treatment is added. It's unnecessary for Postgres or SQLite.\r\n- Minor changes to avoid hard-coding minimum version numbers in the string returned (using `.format()` rather than f-string to consider potential lower Python versions used by users).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

are two types of constraints now:\r\n\r\n* default constraints that contain all depenedncies of airflow,\r\n  all the provider packages released at the time of the relese\r\n  of that version, as well as all transitive dependencies. Following\r\n  those constraints, you can be sure Airflow's installation is\r\n  repeatable\r\n\r\n* no-providers constraints - containing only the dependencies needed\r\n  for core airflow installation. This allows to install/upgrade\r\n  airflow without also forcing the provider's to be installed at\r\n  specific version of Airflow.\r\n\r\nThis allows for flexible management of Airflow and Provider\r\npackages separately.

wanted to verify my own image with this script, but I got lost about how to configure the environment variables. For this reason, I would like to split this script into two scripts: one script that is well integrated with our CI environment, and the other that allows us to define our own image and is therefore more user-friendly.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I made some other minor changes:\r\n- All tests are always run, but if one check fails, the script fails.\r\n- Rename some functions: check_feature -> check_command, verify_production_image_features -> verify_production_image_python_modules\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

the REST API uses a separate authentication method to the webserver authentication. The current authentication method through the auth_backend won't allow us to build a modern UI based on the REST API. This is because it's too flexible. Users can customise it and if we use it for a new UI, it posses the problem that misconfiguration can make the new UI to fail.\r\n\r\nThis PR seeks to add `/login` endpoint with jwt authentication backend. This will help us to build a new UI using the REST API.\r\nThe JWT authentication works alongside other auth_backends.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to create a separate authentication for accessing the REST API without failure.  When the `/login` endpoint is requested with email and password. If the email and password are correct, a jwt token is generated for the request and sent back together with the user data. This token can then be used in subsequent requests to other endpoints and are verified/authenticated. \r\n\r\nThe token is signed with an expiration time which I took from the `session_lifetime_minutes` configuration. \r\n\r\nUser data to be returned after a successful login is also being worked on in this PR.\r\n\r\n As I want to return the full user data, I'm also working on the permission and role data\r\n\r\nNote: `auth_backend` still works as this new auth backend is just an addition and strictly for v1 stable API\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

This would lead to jobs being spun up and completing but Airflow thinking they failed because it timed out trying to get the logs/exit status. Upon further inspection it looked like it was coming from this function, which we confirmed with the fixes in this PR that we now use in our own environment. CPU Usage has dropped dramatically and we're no longer getting errors around the status of the container.\r\n\r\nThe main fix is just simply moving the sleep to the correct scope and increasing it slightly, the other \"just to be extra safe\" fix is to check that the event stream is not None before trying to iterate over it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the
