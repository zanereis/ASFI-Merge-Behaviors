What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2808\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n- Activate \"rememberMe\" by following the steps on the

standard behavior on many web-apps, some folks (as exemplified on the Shiro documentation) find it \"not secure\". I'd like to know Zeppelin folks' opinion on this.\r\n* The \"remember me\" checkbox will show, regardless of whether you configure the rememberMeManager or not. Should this be a default? Should we hide it from the UI based on some config?\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-25T20:15:25Z","updated_at":"2018-07-04T09:06:34Z","closed_at":"2018-07-04T09:06:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"acb8b1a7a5fefa7f3da36e2c9701b6278ab67110","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2503/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2503/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2503/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/a0a5437d75282b60686f915436cb96e4cb661a8d","head":{"label":"herval:remember-me","ref":"remember-me","sha":"a0a5437d75282b60686f915436cb96e4cb661a8d","user":{"login":"herval","id":5610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval","html_url":"https://github.com/herval","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94832456,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDgzMjQ1Ng==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"herval/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"herval","id":5610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval","html_url":"https://github.com/herval","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/herval/zeppelin","description":"A

ldap://ldap.foo\r\nldapRealm.contextFactory.authenticationMechanism = simple\r\nldapRealm.userDnTemplate = uid={0},cn=users,dc=ods,dc=foo\r\nldapRealm.searchBase = dc=ods,dc=foo,dc=corp\r\nldapRealm.userSearchBase = cn=users,dc=ods,dc=foo\r\nldapRealm.groupSearchBase = cn=groups,dc=ods,dc=foo\r\nldapRealm.authorizationEnabled = true\r\nldapRealm.groupObjectClass = posixGroup\r\nldapRealm.memberAttribute = memberUid\r\nldapRealm.userObjectClass = posixAccount\r\nldapRealm.memberOfAttribute = memberOf\r\nldapReal.groupSearchFilter = '(memberUid={0})'\r\nsecurityManager.realms = $ldapRealm\r\nsessionManager = org.apache.shiro.web.session.mgt.DefaultWebSessionManager\r\nsecurityManager.sessionManager = $sessionManager\r\nsecurityManager.sessionManager.globalSessionTimeout = 86400000\r\nshiro.loginUrl = /api/login\r\n\r\n[urls]\r\n/api/version = anon\r\n/api/metrics = anon\r\n/api/interpreter/repository/** = authc\r\n/api/configurations/** = authc\r\n/api/credential/** = authc\r\n/api/notebook-repositories = authc\r\n# /** = anon\r\n/** = authc\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou can tell the role fetching worked inspecting the web call to `/ticker`, which will now return the full roles list\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?\r\n* Does this needs documentation?\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-20T17:11:16Z","updated_at":"2017-10-01T18:49:22Z","closed_at":"2017-10-01T18:49:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"72c12ac05fc449744c300d410de6df4734a1b42c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2498/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2498/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2498/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/cfab47c96eabf72609032b1b97af71f0ce9e5268","head":{"label":"herval:ldap-roles","ref":"ldap-roles","sha":"cfab47c96eabf72609032b1b97af71f0ce9e5268","user":{"login":"herval","id":5610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval","html_url":"https://github.com/herval","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94832456,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDgzMjQ1Ng==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"herval/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"herval","id":5610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval","html_url":"https://github.com/herval","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/herval/zeppelin","description":"A

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis exposes JMX metrics for a few operations on Zeppelin. The first step here is to expose them via JMX, then later introduce a JSON endpoint (which would make it easier to integrate these metrics on common monitoring systems such as Prometheus, Graphite, Influx, etc\r\n\r\nI'm putting this out as WIP before finishing the tests & JSON bits in order to kick-off any design discussion and address comments sooner than later\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Tests\r\n* [x] - JSON endpoint\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2711\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n- Run Zeppelin\r\n- Open `localhost:8080/api/metrics` for the JSON metrics\r\n- Use `jconsole` and browse `org.apache.zeppelin.metrics` for the JMX metrics\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n* Does this needs

What is this PR for?\r\nThis contribution would to introduce Neo4j Cypher intepreter and at the same time provides base APIs that enable other graph databases (or graph framworks such as GraphX or Giraph).\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Feature]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Provide base APIs to manage graph results (under: org.apache.zeppelin.interpreter.graph.*)\r\n* [x] - Create the Neo4j intepreter\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[[ZEPPELIN-2761]](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2761)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nDonwload and execute [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/download/?ref=home) v3.x, you can also pull a [Docker image](https://neo4j.com/developer/docker/).\r\n\r\nIn order to execute test cases, if you are running Java 7, you need to also provide an environment variable telling the tests where to find Java 8, because Neo4j-the-database needs it to run.\r\n```bash\r\nexport NEO4J_JAVA=<path/to/java/home>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse this statement to create a dummy dataset\r\n```bash\r\n%neo4j\r\nUNWIND range(1,100) as id\r\nCREATE (p:Person {id:id, name: \"Name \" + id, age: id % 3}) WITH collect(p) as people\r\nUNWIND people as p1\r\nUNWIND range(1,10) as friend\r\nWITH p1, people[(p1.id + friend) % size(people)] as p2\r\nCREATE (p1)-[:KNOWS {years: abs(p2.id - p2.id)}]->(p2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can write some simple queries like:\r\n```bash\r\n%neo4j\r\nMATCH (p:Person)-[r:KNOWS]-(p1:Person)\r\nRETURN p, r, p1\r\nLIMIT 10;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n%neo4j\r\nMATCH (p:Person)-[r:KNOWS]-(p1:Person)\r\nRETURN p.id AS ID_A, p.name AS NAME_A, r.years AS YEARS, p1.id AS ID_B, p1.name AS NAME_B\r\nLIMIT 20;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Video\r\n![zeppelin query

breaking changes for older versions? **No**\r\n* Does this needs documentation? **Yes**","created_at":"2017-07-10T21:45:02Z","updated_at":"2017-10-19T17:21:29Z","closed_at":"2017-10-11T06:44:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"09ba0e5e1a1e2621898eb011d4e15368f91a76f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2478/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2478/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2478/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/5fb97ced62968b10a5dab7199d907d65b9996f41","head":{"label":"conker84:master","ref":"master","sha":"5fb97ced62968b10a5dab7199d907d65b9996f41","user":{"login":"conker84","id":1833335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzMzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1833335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conker84","html_url":"https://github.com/conker84","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conker84/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conker84/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conker84/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conker84/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conker84/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conker84/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conker84/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conker84/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conker84/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"300c9ef1624033ea8c0ad21c6a7f183727fc9274","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32848140,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg0ODE0MA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"apache/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\nThis is the first step for implement IPython Interpreter in Zeppelin.  I just use the jupyter_client to create and manage the ipython kernel. We don't need to care about python compilation and execution, all the things are delegated to ipython kernel. Ideally all the features of ipython should be available in Zeppelin as well.  \r\n\r\nFor now, user can use %python.ipython for IPython Interpreter. And if ipython is available, the default python interpreter will use ipython. But user can still set `zeppelin.python.useIPython` as false to enforce to use the old implementation of python interpreter. \r\n\r\nMain features:\r\n* IPython interpreter support\r\n** All the ipython features are available, including visualization, ipython magics. \r\n* ZeppelinContext support\r\n* Streaming output support\r\n* Support Ipython in PySpark\r\n\r\nRegarding the visualization, ideally all the visualization libraries work in jupyter should also work here.\r\nIn unit test, I only verify the following 3 popular visualization library. could add more later.\r\n* matplotlib\r\n* bokeh\r\n* ggplot\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Feature ]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2753\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nUnit test is added. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nVerify bokeh in IPython Interpreter\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/164491/27999716-756d749e-6552-11e7-90bb-4c6b08f4ab5c.png)\r\n\r\nVerify matplotlib\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/164491/28046960-e881b28e-6619-11e7-9e1f-7f4662f842f3.png)\r\n\r\nVerify ZeppelinContext\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/164491/28119378-4212620c-6747-11e7-89d5-3b5e609593ce.png)\r\n\r\nVerify Streaming\r\n![streaming](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/164491/28950974-8f92fe1e-78fa-11e7-841f-3174da198bb7.gif)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nWe have improved zeppelin-web, but some parts are still messy. As part of keeping zeppelin-web module healthy ([ZEPPELIN-2725](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2725)), I suggest having these file structure. (Refer the screenshot section)\r\n\r\nHere are few reasons.\r\n\r\n- unified directory, file name helps us to recognize, find which part we should modify / fix\r\n  * Let's say we need to modify the resize feature of paragraph, where the developer can find it? currently, it's under `component/resizable` not under `paragraph/resizeable` and also it's not the shareable component. There is no reason to keep that files in `component/**`\r\n- [this structure](https://github.com/toddmotto/angularjs-styleguide#file-naming-conventions) is what the angularjs community has verified for few years. so newly joined developers can feel more comfortable.\r\n- this is necessary for [Modular archiecture](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2750) and it eventually helps us to make a smooth transition toward next technologies (even whatever we will use)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, \r\n\r\n- This is not the meaningless refactoring PR and doesn't block developing new features / fixes (Please refer the `Some Details` section)\r\n- I will handle conflicts for few days would be brought by other WIPs\r\n\r\nFor your information, \r\n\r\n- https://github.com/toddmotto/angularjs-styleguide#file-naming-conventions\r\n- https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#naming\r\n\r\n#### How to Review This PR?\r\n\r\nPlease follow the commits. I modified submodules by splitting commits. Thus commit message includes what has been done in that PR. For example,\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4968473/27993114-d8ac45e6-64dd-11e7-8130-f3fa887054a1.png)\r\n\r\n#### Some Details\r\n\r\n- Didn't change the widely used variable names not to make many conflicts. For example, `websocketMsgSrv`, `arrayOrderingSrv`\r\n- Since there are helium packages already published, didn't change the HTML file names like `pivot_setting.html` (it's better to use `pivot-setting.html` if we following the rule)\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement | Refactoring]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\nPlease refer the commit message.\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2749](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2749)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n**All functionalities must work** as like before, CI will test it. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n#### Before: messy, mixed directory structure\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4968473/27993126-0a94aca6-64de-11e7-93db-548b6fcc6913.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### After: only the shared components will be placed under `components/`\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4968473/27993118-ee1bd2d4-64dd-11e7-95b6-f71dc628a94e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? - NO\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? - NO\r\n* Does this needs documentation? -

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nMove angular related packages from bower to npm. Because bower team recommends using npm (or yarn) instead of bower. It will not be maintained.\r\n\r\nFor angular-websocket, can't move it to npm currently.

There's another PR about using webhdfs to implement that. Actually hdfs client library is compatibility cross major versions. See http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/Compatibility.html#Wire_compatibility, if using webhdfs, the code become more complicated and may lose some features of hdfs. \r\n\r\nThis PR is also required for HA of zeppelin, so that multiple zeppelin instances can share notes via hdfs.  I add hadoop-client in pom file. So zeppelin will package hadoop client jar into its binary distribution. This is because zeppelin may be installed in a gateway machine where no hadoop is installed (only hadoop configuration file is existed in this machine) And since the hadoop client will work with multiple versions of hadoop, so it is fine to package into binary distribution. Spark also package hadoop client jar in its binary distribution. \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Feature]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1515\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nUnit test is added.

What is this PR for?\r\nThis commit disables generating a Shiro `SecurityManager` from the `IniSecurityManagerFactory`, and instead let's the `WebEnvironment` instantiate the `SecurityManager`. The `initParameter` \"staticSecurityManagerEnabled\" ensures this `SecurityManager` is set and available for use.\r\n\r\nOverall, this prevents the double parsing of `shiro.ini`, which can cause double instantiation. This is particularly thorny with things like EHCache, which need uniquely named caches, and will throw an exception if a cache with the same name already exists.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix ]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2659](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2659)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n- Enable Shiro by copying the shiro.ini.template to shiro.ini. Attempt logging in as a user. \r\n- Enable WebSessions and EHCache by adding the following lines to the `[main]` section of shiro.ini, and attempt logging in.\r\n```\r\n[main]\r\n...\r\nsessionManager = org.apache.shiro.web.session.mgt.DefaultWebSessionManager\r\nsecurityManager.sessionManager = $sessionManager\r\n\r\nsessionDAO = org.apache.shiro.session.mgt.eis.EnterpriseCacheSessionDAO\r\nsecurityManager.sessionManager.sessionDAO = $sessionDAO\r\n\r\ncacheManager = org.apache.shiro.cache.ehcache.EhCacheManager\r\nsecurityManager.cacheManager = $cacheManager\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?\r\n    * No.\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?\r\n    * No.\r\n* Does this needs documentation?\r\n    * No.\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-29T23:04:33Z","updated_at":"2017-07-02T11:05:15Z","closed_at":"2017-07-02T11:05:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"358ac65b331bf1b3dcea8622e39ec6994a27d79a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2453/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2453/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2453/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/d4e0979a3eaf95cb0c0f3db38398c2ffbe9ce58d","head":{"label":"sctincman:ZEPPELIN-2659","ref":"ZEPPELIN-2659","sha":"d4e0979a3eaf95cb0c0f3db38398c2ffbe9ce58d","user":{"login":"sctincman","id":87428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman","html_url":"https://github.com/sctincman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94375708,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDM3NTcwOA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"sctincman/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sctincman","id":87428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman","html_url":"https://github.com/sctincman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sctincman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sctincman/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nWe have a few notebooks that have a list of writers & owners, but no restricted readers list.\r\nWhen you try to open these notebooks as a reader AND they have a chart the app sends a COMMIT_PARAGRAPH for each, which causes a write permission popup to show (\"Insufficient privileges to write note\").\r\nI tracked down the issue to the result.controller.js (commitParagraphResult) - propagating the \"viewOnly\" state fixes that behavior.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n- Create a notebook. Add a paragraph with a graph. Set the \"owner\" of the notebook to something other than yourself. You won't be able to load the notebook without the security popup anymore (unless logging in as the owner)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?\r\nNo\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?\r\nNo\r\n* Does this needs documentation?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-26T17:02:01Z","updated_at":"2019-08-22T15:16:10Z","closed_at":"2018-07-04T09:06:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"876ef3446cb388219c78dda94db2b73a0538ec35","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2439/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2439/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2439/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/b4e29c4a152d954af81bcd13301c9db3f89ca034","head":{"label":"herval:dont-write-as-a-reader","ref":"dont-write-as-a-reader","sha":"b4e29c4a152d954af81bcd13301c9db3f89ca034","user":{"login":"herval","id":5610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval","html_url":"https://github.com/herval","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94832456,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDgzMjQ1Ng==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"herval/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"herval","id":5610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval","html_url":"https://github.com/herval","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herval/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/herval/zeppelin","description":"A

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to make Flink interpreter able to distribute external dependencies on cluster when they are loaded by Web UI.\r\n\r\nThe code simply collects jar paths downloaded by DependecyResolver and add them to FlinkILoop constructor.\r\n\r\nLoading external dependencies in Flink interpreter only work with MiniCluster and Flink version lower than 1.3.0. Only Spark is able to distribute jars at the moment.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2675 \r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n1. [Download Flink](https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html) and run local cluster with following command:\r\n\r\n```./bin/start-cluster.sh```\r\n\r\n2. go to the interpreter page and in dependencies section add artifact: \r\n\r\n```joda-time:joda-time:jar:2.9.9```\r\n\r\n3.  change `local` with `localhost` in interpreter page\r\n\r\n4. run below code in paragraph\r\n\r\n```\r\n%flink\r\nimport org.joda.time.{DateTime, DateTimeZone}\r\n\r\nval text = benv.fromElements(\"To be or not to be\")\r\ntext\r\n  .flatMap { _.toLowerCase.split(\" \") }\r\n  .map(word => (word, new DateTime(System.currentTimeMillis(), DateTimeZone.UTC) ))\r\n  .print()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nI didn't intended to make such large change at the beginning, but found many things are coupled together that I have to make such large change. Several suggestions for you how to review and read it.\r\n\r\n* I move the interpreter package from zeppelin-zengine to zeppelin-interpreter, this is needed for this refactoring.\r\n* The overall change is the same as I described in the design doc. I would suggest you to read the unit test first. These unit test is very readable and easy to understand what the code is doing now. `InterpreterFactoryTest`, `InterpreterGroupTest`, `InterpreterSettingTest`, `InterpreterSettingManagerTest`, `RemoteInterpreterTest`.\r\n* Remove the referent counting logic. Now I will kill the interpreter process as long as all the sessions in the same interpreter group is closed. (I plan to add another kind of policy for the interpreter process lifecycle control, ZEPPELIN-2197)\r\n* The `RemoteFunction` I introduced is for reducing code duplicates when we use RPC.\r\n* The changes in Job.java and RemoteScheduler is for fixing the race issue bug. This bug cause the flaky test we see often in `ZeppelinSparkClusterTest.pySparkTest`\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix | Refactoring]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2627\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nUnit test is added\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-21T08:14:08Z","updated_at":"2017-08-28T05:55:49Z","closed_at":"2017-08-28T01:14:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f434b8c3eebb4d5b9028838ce1ffff3c37108460","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2422/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2422/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2422/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/4724c98611fa7341ca2c407032a7851d518e73e3","head":{"label":"zjffdu:interpreter_refactor","ref":"interpreter_refactor","sha":"4724c98611fa7341ca2c407032a7851d518e73e3","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":46907161,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NjkwNzE2MQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"zjffdu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nProblem:\r\nWhile performing LDAP authentication, current Shiro module does a group=* search while trying to get group-to-role mapping for any LDAP user. On a large LDAP directory, this is a serious problem which might render RolesByGroup feature not working as expected.\r\n\r\nFix:\r\nCurrently while doing LDAP authentication, there is no available option to limit the group search results to the only groups that user is interested in. This bug addresses the same and adds group search filter to Shiro configuration for LdapRealm which will allow user to define a search filter and limit the group search results.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-2657] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2657\r\n\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1. Use org.apache.zeppelin.realm.LdapRealm as Shiro realm\r\n2. In the shiro_ini configruation, define a group search filter like this:\r\nldapRealm.groupSearchFilter = (&(objectclass=groupofnames)(member={0}))\r\nor \r\nldapRealm.groupSearchFilter = (&(objectclass=groupofnames)(cn=zeppelin-users*))\r\n3. Also define other LdapRealm parameters as necessary like rolesByGroup etc.\r\n4. When an LDAP user, who is part of the group that matches filter above, logs in, then the roles are applied. If the LDAP user is not part these defined groups, then the roles are not applied.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? N/A\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? N/A\r\n* Does this needs documentation?
