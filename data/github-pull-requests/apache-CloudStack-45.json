hosts:\r\n````\r\nopenvswitch.dpdk.enabled=true\r\nopenvswitch.dpdk.ovs.path=OVS_PATH\r\n````\r\n\r\nDPDK guest VMs can be set by sending extra configurations as part of the 'deployVirtualMachine' or 'updateVirtualMachine' API methods. Extra configurations are controlled by a new global setting 'enable.additional.vm.configuration'.\r\nExtra configurations are parts of XML data which are appended to the domail XML of the VM. CloudStack expects an UTF-8 URL encoded string as 'extraconfig' parameter on the mentioned API methods.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nIn the UI, when Setting up a recurring snapshot for a volume and clicking 'Add', the newly added scheduled snapshot entry is not displayed in the 'Scheduled Snapshots' table. Also, the 'Keep' input field does not limit the length of a number that can be added. This causes the API not return an error that the value is invalid.\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\nAfter adding a recurring snapshot, it must display in the 'Scheduled Snapshots' table. The 'Keep' input field must restrain a user from entering too large of a number.\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nKVM utilised under CloudStack uses the standard libvirt hook script behaviour. During the install of the KVM CloudStack agent the script \"/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu\" is populated based on the CloudStack-provided file \"libvirtqemuhook.in\". This is a python script that carries out network management every time a VM is started, stopped or migrated (as per the qemu script specification). Please note that CloudStack does not provide any scripts for other libvirt actions – and the scope of this feature request is limited to the \"qemu\" script itself.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\nDesign Document page:\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/KVM+hook+script+include\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Then stop a VM. Check that order of execution will be as follows: • stopped_123.sh • all_234.sh • stopped_456.sh • stopped_abc.py\r\n* Output of stderr and stdout is logged: Create a stopped_error.sh that will return an error. Stop a VM Error log is logged in the qemu-hook.log as well as stdout.\r\n* Prepare action: Start an instance. Observe that prepare action is part of starting a VM and it executes all prepare_* scripts.\r\n* Start action: Start an instance. Observe that when starting a VM it executes all start_* scripts.\r\n* Started action: Start an instance Observe that started action is part of starting a VM and it executes all started _* scripts.\r\n* Stopped action: Stop an instance. When an instance is stopped all s topped_* scripts are executed.\r\n* Release action: Stop an instance. Observe that release action is part of stopping a VM and it executes all release_* scripts.\r\n* Migrate action: Migrate an instance to another host. All migrate_* scripts are executed.\r\n* Restore action: Restore action is not available to be invoked by cloudstack - agent but it still is available within the limits of this feature. It can be run manually with the following syntax: restore <file> [ -- bypass - cache] [ -- xml <string>] [ - - running] [ -- paused]. All restore_* scripts are executed.\r\n* Reconnect action: Restart libvirt. All reconnect_* scripts are executed.\r\n* Attach action: Restore action is not available to be invoked by cloudstack - agent but it still is available wit hin the limits of this feature. It can be run manually with the following syntax: attach - disk <domain> <source> <target> [ -- driver <string>] [ -- subdriver <string>] [ -- cache <string>] [ -- type <string>] [ -- mode <string>] [ -- sourcetype <string>] [ --serial <st ring>] [ -- shareable] [ -- rawio] [ -- address <string>] [ -- multifunction] [ -- persistent] [ -- config] [ -- live] [ -- current]. All attach_* scripts are executed.\r\n* Invalid action: Call libvirthook.in with 'invalid' action parameter Error message of invalid act ion is logged in the qemu – hook.log.\r\n* Invalid file name: Create a 123.py script without any action prefix and underscore 123.py script is not executed.\r\n* Arguments passing: Create start_args.sh script capturing input parameters and start VM. S tart_ args.sh is executed and captures same input parameters as t he qemu script.\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nfixes #2575 \r\n\r\nIn the dictionary internationalization javascript files there are certain label translation descriptions that contain HTML markup to help format the text when it is rendered in the UI. \r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\nExpected Behaviour:\r\nThese HTML markup tags must be rendered as HTML instead of plain text.\r\n\r\nActual Behaviour:\r\nThese HTML markup tags are currently rendering as plain text instead of HTML.\r\nFor example, the HTML line break tag renders as plain text: '\\<br/\\>' instead of rendering an actual HTML line break.\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce:\r\nCreate a Zone. In the UI, in the left-hand pane, click on the Infrastructure link and click on Zones.\r\nOn the Zones screen, click on the 'Create Zone' button to create a Zone. Follow the Zone creation wizard steps up until the 'HOST' step. Notice that the description contains the '\\<br/\\>' text instead of rendering it as HTML.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nfixes #2575 \r\n\r\nIn the dictionary internationalization javascript files there are certain label translation descriptions that contain HTML markup to help format the text when it is rendered in the UI. \r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\nExpected Behaviour:\r\nThese HTML markup tags must be rendered as HTML instead of plain text.\r\n\r\nActual Behaviour:\r\nThese HTML markup tags are currently rendering as plain text instead of HTML.\r\nFor example, the HTML line break tag renders as plain text: '\\<br/\\>' instead of rendering an actual HTML line break.\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce:\r\nCreate a Zone. In the UI, in the left-hand pane, click on the Infrastructure link and click on Zones.\r\nOn the Zones screen, click on the 'Create Zone' button to create a Zone. Follow the Zone creation wizard steps up until the 'HOST' step. Notice that the description contains the '\\<br/\\>' text instead of rendering it as HTML.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

In the UI, in the left-hand pane, click on the Infrastructure link and click on Zones.\r\nOn the Zones screen, click on the 'Create Zone' button to create a Zone. Follow the Zone creation wizard steps up until the 'HOST' step.

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nIn the UI, the 'Project' drop-down displays all the projects that the logged in user is a member of.\r\nA regular user can add other accounts to a project when creating the project. \r\nAn Admin user can also add other accounts to an existing project.\r\nWhen user 'x' adds account 'y' to a project 'z' and user 'y' is logged in to another session at the same time, the 'Project' drop-down in user 'y' session does not display project 'z' to which he/she has just been added as a member in the other session. \r\nThe latest project addition will only display in the drop-down if the user refreshes the HTML page.\r\n\r\nExpected Behaviour:\r\nWhenever user 'y' clicks on the drop-down to display the projects, it must include the newly added project 'z' without having to refresh the HTML page.\r\nWhenever a user clicks on the 'Project' drop-down to display the projects he/she is a member of, Cloudstack must fetch the latest projects data from the database and repopulate the drop-down so that it displays all the up-to-date projects including projects that this user has been added to in other user sessions.\r\n\r\nCurrent Behaviour:\r\nWhenever user 'y' clicks on the drop-down to display the projects, it does not include the newly added project 'z' unless the HTML page is refreshed.\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce:\r\nIn the UI, log in as an Admin User. While logged in as an Admin User, also log in to another session as a different user. \r\nGo back to the Admin User session and on the lefthand side, select the Projects link.\r\nCreate a new project or select an existing project. Add to the project the account belonging to the user that you used to log in to the other session. \r\nAfter adding the account to the project in the Admin User session, go back to the added account user's session and click on the 'Project' drop-down in the top left corner. The drop-down will display all the projects that the user is a part of, except the project that he/she has just been added to in the Admin user's session.\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

While logged in as an Admin User, also log in to another session as a different user. \r\nGo back to the Admin User session and on the lefthand side, select the Projects link.\r\nCreate a new project or select an existing project. Add to the project the account belonging to the user that you used to log in to the other session. \r\nAfter adding the account to the project in the Admin User session, go back to the added account user's session and click on the 'Project' drop-down in the top left corner. The drop-down will now display all the projects that the user is a part including the project that he/she has just been added to in the Admin user's session.\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\nCloudStack version 4.11, KVM hypervisor.\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

Description\r\nThe KVM Agent had two mechanisms for reporting its capabilities\r\nand memory to the Management Server.\r\n\r\nOn startup it would ask libvirt the amount of Memory the Host has\r\nand subtract and add the reserved and overcommit memory.\r\n\r\nWhen the HostStats were however reported to the Management Server\r\nthese two configured values on the Agent were no longer reported\r\nin the statistics thus showing all the available memory in the\r\nAgent/Host to the Management Server.\r\n\r\nThis commit unifies this by using the same logic on Agent Startup\r\nand during statistics reporting.\r\n\r\n  memory=3069636608, reservedMemory=1073741824\r\n\r\nThis was reported by a 4GB Hypervisor with this setting:\r\n\r\n  host.reserved.mem.mb=1024\r\n\r\nThe GUI (thus API) would then show:\r\n\r\n  Memory Total\t2.86 GB\r\n\r\nThis way the Agent properly 'lies' to the Management Server about its\r\ncapabilities in terms of Memory.\r\n\r\nThis is very helpful if you want to overprovision or undercommit machines\r\nfor various reasons.\r\n\r\nOvercommitting can be done when KSM or ZSwap or a fast SWAP device is\r\ninstalled in the machine.\r\n\r\nUnderprovisioning is done when the Host might run other tasks then a KVM\r\nhypervisor, for example when it runs in a hyperconverged setup with Ceph.\r\n\r\nIn addition internally many values have been changed from a Double to a Long\r\nand also store the amount of bytes instead of Kilobytes.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI tested this on a CloudStack 4.12 test setup running on my local system.\r\n\r\nThe KVM Agent will report the amount of memory it has minus any reservations.

In 4.9 systemvm code, it used to reboot after setup of router nic-mac addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/4.9/systemvm/patches/debian/config/etc/init.d/cloud-early-config#L914\r\n\r\nThis PR reintroduces rebooting only in case of VMware where the issue was seen with older hypervisors/vcenter versions.

They fail to work and get network working on its private/control ip for mgmt server to ssh and program the router. This reintroduces a reboot logic which was in 4.9 and may fix the issue for vmware only (esp 5.5u3 and older environments).\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nCurrently DestroyVMCmd does not have the option to delete any attached volumes (Data Disks), resulting in unused orphan volumes sitting in CloudStack, unless the user manually deletes them or attach them to a different VM. This FR will introduce functionality to allow users of any type (who are owners of the VM) to delete the attached volumes either via the API or the UI. The UI will have the option to select which volumes should be deleted, or they can select the option to delete none. CloudStack will then detach and delete the selected volumes after destroying the VM.\r\nDestroyVMCmd will be modified to accept a comma separated list of volume UUIDs that will be deleted. CloudStack will then validate this list, making sure that the volumes are indeed attached to the VM. If not, the operation will fail. Checks are also done to make sure the volumes are data disks.\r\nBefore destroying the VM, CloudStack will first detach the volumes, and after the VM has been destroyed, delete the volumes.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

the ethernet device index was used as `rt_table` index and\r\npacket marking id/integer. With eth0 that is sometimes used as link-local\r\ninterface, the rt_table index `0` would fail as `0` is already defined\r\nas a catchall (unspecified). The fwmarking on packets on eth0 with 0x0\r\nwould also fail. This fixes the routing issues, by adding 100 to the\r\nethernet device index so the value is a non-zero, for example then the\r\nrelationship between rt_table index and ethernet would be like:\r\n\r\n100 -> Table_eth0 -> eth0 -> fwmark 100 or 0x64\r\n101 -> Table_eth1 -> eth1 -> fwmark 101 or 0x65\r\n101 -> Table_eth2 -> eth2 -> fwmark 102 or 0x66\r\n\r\nThis would maintain the legacy design of routing based on packet mark\r\nand appropriate routing table rules per table/ids. This also fixes a\r\nminor NPE issue around listing of snapshots.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

On the Instances screen, select a VM instance that has more than one NIC and then select the NICs screen. Scroll down to where the second NIC bar is displayed. Notice that it does not display all the details of the first NIC correctly. The last few rows of text overlap with the second NIC's text.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nIn the UI, when a user navigates to a screen that displays a table of data and hovers the mouse over a sortable column header, the cursor does not change to a hand pointer, indicating to the user that it can be clicked on, in order to sort the table's data rows according to that column. \r\nWhen the mouse hovers over the non-sortable 'Quickview' column header, it incorrectly displays a hand pointer cursor instead of a default cursor.\r\nWhen the mouse hovers over a column header, it also does not display the column header's value

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nWhen a regular user navigates to the Dashboard screen and hovers over the 'Latest events' entries, the mouse cursor changes to a hand

This will allow the user to make the correct interpretation that the 'Latest events' entries are not selectable.\r\n\r\nActual Behaviour:\r\nWhen a user navigates to the Dashboard screen and hovers over the 'Latest events' entries, the mouse cursor changes to a hand pointer. This causes a user to incorrectly interpret that the entries are selectable.\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce:\r\nLog in to the Cloudstack UI as a regular User.\r\nOn the Dashboard screen, hover the mouse over the 'Latest events' entries, the cursor changes to a hand pointer.

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nIn the index.html file, the reference to the custom.css file is made on the last line of the \\<head\\> tag. \r\nThe plugins.js file appends a list of CSS files to the \\<head\\> tag dynamically, consequently placing them after the custom.css file and overriding it.\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\nExpected Behaviour:\r\nThe plugins.js file must insert the list of CSS files before the custom.css file so that it does not get overridden.\r\n\r\nActual Behaviour:\r\nThe plugins.js file appends a list of CSS files to the \\<head\\> tag dynamically, consequently placing them after the custom.css file and overriding it.\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce:\r\nLog in to the Cloudstack UI using your favourite browser.\r\nUse your browser's development tool to view the HTML elements of the index.html loaded in

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nOn the 'NICs' tab, when a user clicks the 'Add network to VM' button to add a network to a VM, the 'Add network to VM' popup screen does not have an IP Address input field to allow a user to define a specific IP Address for a NIC. A user can specify the IP address for the first NIC when creating a VM instance, but cannot do that for subsequent NICs when adding a network to a VM.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\nTo Reproduce:\r\nGo to the 'Instances' screen by clicking the 'Instances' tab on the lefthand side.\r\nOn the 'Instances' screen click on a specific VM instance name. \r\nThis will open the 'Details' tab for the specific VM instance.\r\nClick on the 'NICs' tab and then click on the 'Add network to VM' button to add a network to a VM. \r\nThe 'Add network to VM' popup screen will display.\r\n\r\nActual Behaviour:\r\nThe 'Add network to VM' popup screen does not have an IP Address input field to allow a user to define a specific IP Address for a NIC.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\nThe 'Add network to VM' popup screen must have an IP Address input field to allow a user to define a specific IP Address for a NIC.\r\nSince the addNicToVirtualMachine API's ipaddress field is not required, the IP Address input field is also not a required field.\r\nThe IP Address input field must be validated for a valid IPv4 formatted value if the user enters anything into the field.\r\nThe valid user-specified IPv4 IP Address value must be allocated to the NIC if it is within the acceptable IP range for the chosen Network.\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nIn the Add Zone Wizard, when a user lands on the Physical Network page, by default the first Physical Network gets initialized with the 3 Traffic Types: Guest, Management and Public. When a user drags the Management or Public Traffic Types from the first Physical Network to a second or nth Physical Network and then clicks the next button to go to the next screen, and then decides to click the previous button to go back to the Physical Network screen, the UI initializes the physicalNetwork again and thus moves these Traffic Types back to their original position in the first Physical Network as if it is the first time the user navigated to this page. \r\nA fix was made so that when a user clicks the previous button to go back to the Physical Network screen, it does not initialize the physicalNetwork again, therefore leaving the user-defined Traffic Type configuration as it was before the next button was clicked.\r\nFor example, dragging the Management and Storage Traffic Types to Physical Network 2 does not move back when clicking the 'Previous' button.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30108093/43148554-d5005e88-8f65-11e8-9bb8-41be1b6eaf01.png)\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\nActual Behaviour:\r\nIn the Add Zone Wizard, when a user lands on the Physical Network page, by default the first Physical Network gets initialized with the 3 Traffic Types: Guest, Management and Public. When a user drags the Management or Public Traffic Types from the first Physical Network to a second or nth Physical Network and then clicks the next button to go to the next screen, and then decides to click the previous button to go back to the Physical Network screen, the UI initializes the physicalNetwork again and thus moves these Traffic Types back to their original position in the first Physical Network as if it is the first time the user navigated to this page. \r\nExpected Behaviour:\r\nIn the Add Zone Wizard, when clicking the previous button to go back to the Physical Network screen, it must not initialize the physicalNetwork again, therefore leaving the user-defined Traffic Type configuration as it was before the next button was clicked.\r\nTo reproduce:\r\nNavigate and click Infrastructure in the left pane. Click Zones and click the 'Add Zone' button to create a new zone. The 'Add Zone' wizard will appear and select 'Advanced' on the Zone Type screen. Fill in the required field on the 'set up Zone' page and click next. On the Physical Network screen, drag the Management and/or the Public traffic types to another Physical Network. Drag the Storage traffic type to the physical network. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30108093/43148089-df55ffa6-8f64-11e8-8d1f-a04bb7d85c37.png)\r\nAfter adding a label for each traffic type, click the next button to proceed to the Public Traffic screen and then click the Previous button. This will show that the Management traffic type is moved back to Physical Network 1:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30108093/43148385-6b5e4a1c-8f65-11e8-9fd7-db869be4c3b2.png)\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nMike discovered that when PR https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2425/ was merged, we created a bug with managed storage. The following constraints needed to be added to ACS:\r\n* If I want to migrate a VM across clusters, but if at least one of its volumes is placed in a cluster-wide managed storage, the migration is not allowed. On the other hand, if the VM is placed in a managed zone-wide storage, the migration can be executed;\r\n* A volume placed in managed storage can never (at least not using this migrateWithVolume method) be migrated out of the storage pool it resides; \r\n* When migrating a VM that does not have volumes in managed storage, it should be possible to migrate it cross clusters. Therefore, we should try to use the volume allocators to find a suitable storage pool for its volumes in the target cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nThis PR fixes 1 of the Marvin test failures seen in master for KVM hosts (Intermitten failure detected: /marvin/tests/smoke/test_deploy_virtio_scsi_vm.py). I found the issue to be caused by the resetVirtualMachinePassword API call in the setUpClass class method, the VM has to be stopped prior to executing this API call.\r\nAPI Doc: http://cloudstack.apache.org/api/apidocs-4.11/apis/resetPasswordForVirtualMachine.html\r\n\r\nI have added the Stop command before resetting the password and restart the VM afterward. I have found that resources were not being cleaned up after test execution and I have fixed that as well.\r\n\r\nI also made some minor changes to make the file Pep 8 compliant.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nOverview:\r\nThere is currently no functional mechanism that captures or persists the end time of when an asynchronous job has finished. As a result, users are not able to do any reporting about the duration of various asynchronous jobs in Cloudstack.\r\nLink to FS:\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Add+End+Time+To+Asynchronous+Jobs\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue/PRs\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n* Start a virtual machine to initiate an asynchronous job. Query the cloud.async_job table to find the record that was created in response to the 'start virtual machine' job. When the job finishes, verify that the 'removed' column has been correctly updated with the end timestamp of the relevant record.\r\n* Using cloudmonkey, make an API call to queryAsyncJobResult using the uuid as the jobid and verify that the 'endtime' field returns the correct timestamp value of the relevant database record's 'removed' column.\r\n* Verify that the garbage collector deletes the correct expired asynchronous job records from the cloud.async_job table.\r\n* Hypervisor: KVM\r\n* Upgrade from 41110 to 41200.

of #2472 onto 4.11\r\n\r\nIf the KVM heartbeat file can't be written to, the host is rebooted, and thus taking down all VMs running on it. The code does try 5x times before the reboot, but the there is not a delay between the retires, so they are 5 simultaneous retries, which doesn't help. Standard SAN storage HA operations or quick network blip could cause this reboot to occur.\r\n\r\nSome discussions on the dev mailing list revealed that some people are just commenting out the reboot line in their version of the CloudStack source.\r\n\r\nA better option would be have it sleep between tries so it isn't 5x almost simultaneous tries. Plus, instead of rebooting, the cloudstack-agent could just be stopped on the host instead. This will cause alerts to be issued and if the host is disconnected long-enough, depending on the HA code in use, VM HA could handle the host failure.\r\n\r\nThe built-in reboot of the host seemed

feature introduces a new API command that will improve troubleshooting of network issues on CloudStack hosted networks by executing network-utility commands (ping, traceroute, arping) remotely on system VMs. \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nFor troubleshooting purposes, CloudStack administrators may wish to execute network utility commands remotely on system VMs, or request system VMs to ping/traceroute/arping to specific addresses over specific interfaces. An API command to provide such functionalities is being developed without altering any existing APIs. The targeted system VMs for this feature are the Virtual Router (VR), Secondary Storage VM (SSVM) and the Console Proxy VM (CPVM).\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\nFS: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/CloudStack+Remote+Diagnostics+API\r\nML discussion: https://markmail.org/message/xt7owmb2c6iw7tva\r\n\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nOverview:\r\nCloudStack has the concept of executing certain API calls asynchronously when they take a long period of time to complete. They will immediately return a job id of the job that will be responsible for executing the command. This job id can be used to query the status of the job by using the queryAsyncJobResult application programming interface (API) call.\r\nAmong other fields, the result of this API query returns the 'created' field, which is the timestamp of when an asynchronous job started. There is currently no functional mechanism that captures or persists the end time of when the job has finished. As a result, the above \"queryAsyncJobResult\" API does not return an 'end_time' field.\r\nQueryAsyncJobResult API changes:\r\nThe requirement outlined here is for Cloudstack to capture the job end timestamp of when the asynchronous job has finished and to populate this into the existing database field called 'removed' in the async_job table. Please note the 'removed' field is not currently being used anywhere else in the CloudStack code, and the 'removed' database column is also not currently being populated by any other processes. A new response tag should be added to the queryAsyncJobResult API called 'end_time'. When making a queryAsyncJobResult API request, the value of the database column 'removed' should be mapped to this 'end_time' response tag. The queryAsyncJobResult API field should be called 'end_time' instead of 'removed' because it will be more descriptive to an API user.\r\nManagement server process changes:\r\nWhen an asynchronous job completes it is marked as complete by updating its finished status in the database. New functionality should be added to also update the 'removed' field with the timestamp of when an asynchronous job has completed.\r\nIn addition, when the Cloudstack management server is stopped and started again (gracefully or ungracefully), neither this management server nor other running management servers have any knowledge of the true status of the asynchronous jobs that completed during this time it was down. Their statuses are not tracked or updated in the database by any management server during this time, regardless of whether they are still running, finished successfully or finished with an error status. Currently, there is no mechanism to notify other running management servers that a specific management server is stopping or to notify a specific running management server that it should start to monitor/track the currently running asynchronous jobs belonging to the management server being stopped. When a Cloudstack management server starts up, it does not do a blanket delete of the asynchronous jobs it is the owner of. Instead, it finds in the database all the asynchronous jobs it is the owner of, whose statuses are in an 'in_progress' state and updates them to a 'failed' status. At the same time, it should now also mark them as 'removed' by updating the 'removed' field with the current timestamp.\r\nGarbage collection:\r\nCloudStack also has a garbage collector that does database clean-up of asynchronous jobs, whereby it periodically deletes unfinished and completed job records from the async_job database table. It uses the configurable global setting 'job.cancel.threshold.minutes' to cancel jobs that are still in the queue. It also uses a configurable global setting 'job.expire.minutes' that allows a user to specify how long in minutes to keep asynchronous jobs that have not been processed yet, as well as completed asynchronous job records in the database before deleting them. Unfinished jobs that haven't been processed yet and that are older than this expiry time will be expired and deleted by the garbage collector.\r\nAsynchronous jobs that have completed before the timeout threshold will also be deleted. When these jobs complete they are marked as complete by updating their finished status in the database. Currently, the garbage collector uses the 'created' database column to find completed asynchronous job records that are older than the 'job.expire.minutes' global setting's timestamp. It should no longer use the 'created' column to do this. It should use the 'removed' column instead.\r\nDue to the nature of the garbage collector, any reporting that needs to be done on asynchronous jobs, should be done before the garbage collector starts its cleaning up task.\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

the current implementation, for any config drive on a VM it creates a mount point specific to the parent directory `i-x-y-VM` on a host. This means, for each config drive enabled VM there will be a separate mount point per VM per host. The legacy code that points ISOs mounts based on the isopath's parent directory, to workaround this the config drive layout has been changed to: `<sr or mount point>/configdrive/i-x-y-VM.iso`.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that fewer mount points are made on hosts for either primary storagepools or secondary storagepools.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nThere was a concurrency problem with the “moveNetworkAclItem” API method. If two users were changing the ACL rules order at the same time, this could lead to inconsistent actions.\r\n\r\nTo solve the problem we added a “consistency check ” parameter, which is used to hold the consistency hash. This hash is created using an MD5 hash function on a String that is created with all ACL rules UUIDs concatenated in their order, which is defined via the ‘number’ field.\r\n\r\nWe also lock the editing of the ACL while executing the upgrade. This allows us to handle race conditions nicely, and present a good feedback for the user.\r\n\r\nWe are not forcing users to send the consistency hash variable. Therefore, they can use the API call without the hash parameter.
