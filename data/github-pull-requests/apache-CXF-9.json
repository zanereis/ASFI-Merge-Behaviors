&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n      &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;\n          Added a new ReusableRefeerralConnector interface that can be used to provide a\n          way of following referrals using a mechanism that doesn't automatically close\n          connections after they are used.  This allows for the possibility that\n          connections created for the purpose of following referrals could be used for\n          multiple referrals, rather than always closing them after their first use as was\n          previously the case.  Also, added a new PooledReferralConnector implementation\n          that uses connection pools to maintain connections for following referrals.\n          &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;\n\n        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;\n          Fixed an issue in which parallel-update did not properly handle multiple\n          concurrent attempts to write to the reject file, which could cause its contents\n          to be unparseable or otherwise incorrect.\n          &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;\n\n        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;\n          Updated the PLAINBindRequest class to add an encodeCredentials method that can be\n          used to retrieve a properly encoded representation of the SASL credentials for a\n          PLAIN bind request with the given authentication ID, authorization ID, and\n          password.\n          &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;\n\n        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;\n          Updated the JSONNumber class to add getValueAsInteger and getValueAsLong methods\n          that will return the value of the number as an Integer or Long, respectively, but\n          only if it can do so losslessly.  These methods will return null if the value has\n          a fractional component or if it is outside the range of the associated data type.\n          &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;\n\n        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p></code></pre></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

are additional potential references to the `HttpClientFacade` hidden in the property change listeners of `HTTPClientPolicy`. To prevent those from keeping the SelectorManager thread alive, the `HTTPConduit` now registers itself as a listener only via a `WeakReference`, so the conduit can be garbage collected even if the client policy is still referenced inside the SelectorManager thread.\r\n\r\nThis is an alternative to PR #1380, the `WeakReference` approach taken here allows the `HTTPClientPolicy` to change

SelectorManager thread of the WebClient would normally shut down after the HttpClient's outer shell, the `HttpClientFacade` has been garbage collected. Unfortunately the `ProxySelector` instance created in `HttpClientHTTPConduit` is a non-static (anonymous) subclass, so it retains a hard reference to the enclosing `HttpClientHTTPConduit` instance and therefore also its `client` field. This gives the SelectorManager thread a hard reference to the `HttpClientFacade`, so the facade can never be garbage collected and the thread never shuts down. Making the class static solves the problem.","created_at":"2023-08-10T10:06:45Z","updated_at":"2023-08-11T08:23:41Z","closed_at":"2023-08-10T23:40:53Z","merged_at":"2023-08-10T23:40:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"e204d71ce0a2d4af2ed2299c34c49c9ac094dfe4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/pulls/1377/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/pulls/1377/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/1377/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/statuses/4f4807ebdd1e17adac62d7b18f7de5bba64157b3","head":{"label":"LeoWoerteler:CXF-8885","ref":"CXF-8885","sha":"4f4807ebdd1e17adac62d7b18f7de5bba64157b3","user":{"login":"LeoWoerteler","id":545684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/545684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler","html_url":"https://github.com/LeoWoerteler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":676174554,"node_id":"R_kgDOKE2a2g","name":"cxf","full_name":"LeoWoerteler/cxf","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LeoWoerteler","id":545684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/545684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler","html_url":"https://github.com/LeoWoerteler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoWoerteler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LeoWoerteler/cxf","description":"Apache
