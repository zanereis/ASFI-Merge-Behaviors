Python Dataflow Runner previously logged every message received at INFO by default, only storing the most recent error message to return once a pipeline reached a failed state. This leaves that mechanism in place, but logs messages with their corresponding importance (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) as they're received as well. This should surface errors more clearly in logs after jobs exit. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Feature</strong>: Adds support for smithy-modeled endpoint resolution. A new rules-based endpoint resolution will be added to the SDK which will supercede and deprecate existing endpoint resolution. Specifically, EndpointResolver will be deprecated while BaseEndpoint and EndpointResolverV2 will take its place. For more information, please see the Endpoints section in our Developer Guide.</li>\n<li><strong>Dependency Update</strong>: Updated to the latest SDK module versions</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Module Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/amplifyuibuilder</code>: <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/blob/main/service/amplifyuibuilder/CHANGELOG.md#v1120-2023-07-31\">v1.12.0</a>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Feature</strong>: Amplify Studio releases GraphQL support for codegen job action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/autoscaling</code>: <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/blob/main/service/autoscaling/CHANGELOG.md#v1300-2023-07-31\">v1.30.0</a>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Feature</strong>: You can now configure an instance refresh to set its status to 'failed' when it detects that a specified CloudWatch alarm has gone into the ALARM state.

missing partitions have been reconciled and outputted, remove them from the list of missing partitions. This prevents a race condition that leads to multiple reconcile runs consecutively. Added an unit test to verify this works.\r\n\r\nAlso increase the wait time before reconciling because typically reconciler is only needed in pipelines that are slow to process partitions. Adding extra wait time gives the pipeline time to catch up.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

single iteration \"decode on-demand\" stream for the Go SDK.\r\n\r\nOriginally disabled due to #22933, in #23042, the principle remains sound, and it's long past time to look at why it failed in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe issue was that we didn't drain the iterable properly if there were no reads at all, so we go with the slightly more ham fisted approach of iterating until io.EOF, or stream != nil. If the stream isn't nil, it means the reader got handed off, and it's up to that stream to close.\r\n\r\nThis avoids unnecessarily draining something off of the main reader which could be very large and costly.\r\n\r\nFixes #23043\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is in continuation of @shunping-google's work in #27213\r\n\r\nThese are integration tests that write to real BigQuery tables. The test pipeline writes records with a deliberate short timeout between each record so that the Storage API Stream has a chance to recognize the schema update. This PR also adds some warnings when invalid configurations are used (warnings instead of throwing exceptions so as not to break existing workflows. However if we ever do a refactor of this IO, we should turn these warnings into exceptions).\r\n\r\nI've opted to not write tests for Batch writes that use the auto schema update feature because that use-case doesn't make much sense. These tests include both `STORAGE_WRITE_API` and `STORAGE_API_AT_LEAST_ONCE`, which use [StorageApiWritesShardedRecords](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/StorageApiWritesShardedRecords.java) and [StorageApiWriteUnshardedRecord](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/StorageApiWriteUnshardedRecords.java), respectively. Batch writes also use the `StorageApiWriteUnshardedRecord` transform, which manages stream appends and schema updates. This is to say that even though we don't have explicit Batch mode tests, that code path is broadly covered with these tests.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\nHad to replace TestStream with PeriodicImpulse in followup: #27998. This is to allow tests to run on

now, it is possible for users to increment counters incorrectly, leading to errors when we try to construct the counters. These errors are usually opaque and unhelpful (e.g. `TypeError: 123 has type numpy.int64, but expected one of: bytes`). These don't provide enough info to debug. This PR enriches these errors so that users can self serve issues by looking at the metric in question.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Split Flink 1.13-1.16 tests from main Java PreCommit\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\nCurrently, Flink tests are exercised 5 times on Java PreCommit test suite. Some tests are known to be flaky (e.g. #21333). By only run on the lowest and highest supported flink version, it would reduce the flakiness by (1-x)^3 - (1-x)^5 where x is the flaky probability of a single flink test\r\n\r\nOther flink versions are still exercised on the new GitHub Action test suite.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>client: percent-encode the default authority for the channel (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6428\">#6428</a>)</li>\n<li>xds: require EDS service name to be set in a CDS cluster with an 'xdstp' resource name (gRFC A47) (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6438\">#6438</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>New

was recently identified that `ReadFromKafkaDoFn`'s `restrictionTracker` leaked connections that are not being polled anymore.\r\n\r\nThis can cause considerable performance degradation for Kafka clusters, as they rely on the `connections.max.idle.ms` to clean it up.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was also hard to track where new connections were coming from, so I've added a few logs to indicate when a new connection is needed in the critical path.\r\n\r\n\r\n`KafkaLatestOffsetEstimator` doesn't hold any state, so by reusing it across backlog statistics for the same DoFn instance, we can save a huge amount of connections.\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/beam/assets/3207647/2d394410-f4dd-4daa-87c8-2b0aacab2cb0)\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-27T01:25:21Z","updated_at":"2023-07-28T15:59:03Z","closed_at":"2023-07-28T15:59:02Z","merged_at":"2023-07-28T15:59:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"0b30f1495b70016a7ce5e1afecfd93863551b61f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1836391716,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM2MzkxNzE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/java","name":"java","color":"001cf2","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842356709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyMzU2NzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/io","name":"io","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842940002,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyOTQwMDAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/kafka","name":"kafka","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3888027569,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAwi8tc7nvpex","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/Next%20Action:%20Reviewers","name":"Next
