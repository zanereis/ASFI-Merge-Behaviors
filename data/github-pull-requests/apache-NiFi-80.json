PR adds a new nifi-parquet-bundle with PutParquet and FetchParquet processors. These work similar to PutHDFS and FetchHDFS, but instead read and write Records.\r\n\r\nWhile working on this I needed to reuse portions of the record reader/writer code, and thus refactored some of the project structure which caused many files to move around.\r\n\r\nSummary of changes:\r\n- Created nifi-parquet-bundle\r\n- Created nifi-commons/nifi-record to hold domain/API related to records\r\n- Created nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-extension-utils as a place for utility code specific to extensions\r\n- Moved nifi-commons/nifi-processor-utils under nifi-extension-utils\r\n- Moved nifi-commons/nifi-hadoop-utils under nifi-extension-utils\r\n- Create nifi-extension-utils/nifi-record-utils for utility code related records\r\n\r\nTo test the Parquet processors you can create a core-site.xml with a local file system and read/write parquet to local directories:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<configuration>\r\n    <property>\r\n        <name>fs.defaultFS</name>\r\n
