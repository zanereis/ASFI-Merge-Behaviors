empty iterators\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nFix bug in HoodieCombineRealtimeRecordReader with reading empty iterators\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- CombineRealtimeRecordReader has a bug when there are more than two consecutive empty iterators (because of filtering by predicate for example). Fix it by calling next on combine record reader. https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/2346#issuecomment-758591316 has additional details\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\nThere are no existing tests to this module and looks like setup is quite involved. So I'm not able to add tests anytime soon. But this is a trivial fix and has been reported a while ago on support ticket. So sending PR for the fix.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIf the parallelism in the constructor of StreamWriteOperatorFactory is not equal to the parallelism of the Operator, the flink task will run failed.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the StreamWriteOperatorFactory's parallelism less than Operator's parallelism, in `StreamWriteITCase#testWriteToHoodie`, try modify following statement\r\n```\r\n    StreamWriteOperatorFactory<HoodieRecord> operatorFactory =\r\n        new StreamWriteOperatorFactory<>(conf, 4);\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\n    StreamWriteOperatorFactory<HoodieRecord> operatorFactory =\r\n        new StreamWriteOperatorFactory<>(conf, 3);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 3\r\n\tat

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nDeltastreamer works fine for Dataset <Row> sources w/o providing schema provider. But looks like in multi table delta streamer we missed to hold on to that assumption. Tests written for multi table delta streamer are for Dataset <GenericRecord> and hence schema providers are mandatory.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added tests to TestHoodieMultiTableDeltaStreamer to verify the change.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nDuring the bootstrap of the Metadata Table, all the directories which contain the partition metadata directory are assumed to be partitions and are added to the metadata table.\r\n\r\nIn our HDFS clusters, we have directories like .backup, .temp which are used by various teams for non-hoodie purposes (e.g. .backup may be keeping a snapshot of the dataset). During bootstrap, Metadata Table ends up containing all those paths also as partitions.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, I would like to introduce a configuration for HoodieMetadataConfig to filter out some directories based on a regular expression string. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdded a config to HoodieMetadataConfig.\r\nAdded a unit test.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change

resource friendly for streaming write. The more proper way\r\nit to cut the batches based on their real memory data buffer size (say,\r\n128Mb), the writer always flushes the buffer out when its size reaches\r\nthe configured threshold.\r\n\r\nThus, after this change, one instant may span one (if every checkpoint\r\nsucceeds) or more (if there are checkpoint failures) checkpoints. The\r\ninstant only commits when there is a successful checkpoint.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Modify the BaseFlinkCommitActionExecutor to keep the write handles\r\n  explicitly, the write task can then decides when and how to roll over\r\n  the underneath file handles\r\n- The StreamWriteOperatorCoordinator now commits the old instant and\r\n  creates new one only if the checkpoint

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIn my oppions, the hadoop configuration totally read from the actual environment. For example, the `fs.hdfs.impl` may be `org.apache.hadoop.fs.viewfs.ViewFileSyste` but not `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DistributedFileSystem`. Now, the implemtation was forced to be set with `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DistributedFileSystem`, which is not a graceful solution.\r\nAlso, the hadoop dependency scope level should be 'test'.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Remove codes to make the hadoop configuration totally read from the actual environment.\r\n  - Set hadoop dependency scope level to 'test'.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job locally.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis is the #step 2 of RFC-24:\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HUDI/RFC+-+24%3A+Hoodie+Flink+Writer+Proposal\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a BucketAssigner that assigns bucket ID (partition\r\npath & fileID) for each stream record.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to look up index and partition the records anymore in\r\nthe following pipeline for these records,\r\nwe actually decide the write target location before the write and each\r\nrecord computes its location when the BucketAssigner receives it, thus,\r\nthe indexing is with streaming style.\r\n\r\nComputing locations for a batch of records all at a time is resource\r\nconsuming so a pressure to the engine,\r\nwe should avoid that in streaming system.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add `BucketAssigner`\r\n  - Modify the behavior of `HoodieFlinkWriteClient` and `BaseFlinkCommitActionExecutor`\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nAdded tests.\r\n\r\n##

with log\r\n\r\n## *Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nCurrently HoodieMergeOnReadRDD use the payload to combine the log data with the base data, However it does not pass the  PRE_COMBINE_FILED to the payload class, which will result to incorrect query result.\r\nThis PR fix this by passthe PRE_COMBINE_FILED to the DefaultHoodieRecordPayload in HoodieMergeOnReadRDD#mergeRowWithLog.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Store the `preCombineField`  to the `hoodie.properties`. So we can get the  `preCombineField` field when read the table. This add a `preCombineField` field to the `HoodieTableMetaClient#initTableType ` method.\r\n- Pass the `preCombineField` to the `DefaultHoodieRecordPayload` in `HoodieMergeOnReadRDD#mergeRowWithLog`\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added `TestMORDataSource#testPreCombineFiledForReadMOR` to verify the change.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nTimelineServer uses Javalin which is based on Jetty.\r\n\r\nBy default Jetty:\r\n\r\nHas 200 threads\r\nCompresses output by gzip\r\nHandles each request sequentially\r\n \r\n\r\nOn a large-scale HUDI dataset (2000 partitions), when TimelineServer is enabled, the operations slow down due to following reasons:\r\n\r\n - Driver process usually has a few cores. 200 Jetty threads lead to huge contention when 100s of executors connect to the Server in parallel.\r\n - To handle large number of requests in parallel, its better to handle each HTTP request in an asynchronous manner using Futures which are supported by Javalin.\r\n - The compute overhead of gzipping may not be necessary when the executors and driver are in the same rack or within the same datacenter \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdded settings to control the number of threads created, whether to gzip output and to use asynchronous processing of requests. \r\n\r\nWith all the settings enabled, a driver process with 8 cores is able to handle 1024 executors in parallel on a table with 2000 partitions (CLEAN operation which lists all partitions). The time per API requests was also reduced from 800msec to 60msec.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as TimelineServer tests and integration tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nImproves the performance of key lookups from Metadata Table. \r\n\r\nIn my scale testing with 150 partitions and 100K+ files on HDFS, the time to read the key was reduced (100ms avg -> 10ms) and the total data read from the HFile was reduced (85MB -> 3MB). The size of the base file was 3MB so this means that the in-memory HFile block caching was also working. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Cache the KeyScanner across lookups so that the HFile index does not have to be read for each lookup.\r\n2. Enable block caching in KeyScanner.\r\n3. Move the lock to a limited scope of the code to reduce lock contention.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nTo read the hudi table, you need to specify the path, but the path is not only the tablePath corresponding to the table, but needs to be determined by the partition directory structure. Different keyGenerators correspond to different partition directory structures. The first-level partition directory uses path=```.../table/*/*```, the secondary partition directory path=```.../table/*/*/*```，so it is troublesome to let the user specify the data path, the user only needs to specify the tablePath:  ```.../table```\r\n\r\nAt the same time, after reading the hudi table by configuring path=```.../table```, it is more convenient to use sparksql to query the hudi table. You only need to add tabproperties to the hive table metadata: ```spark.sql.sources.provider= hudi```, you can automatically convert the hive table to the hudi table.\r\n\r\n## Brief change
