LowMemoryException.","created_at":"2021-03-03T22:03:16Z","updated_at":"2021-03-11T03:13:48Z","closed_at":"2021-03-11T03:13:47Z","merged_at":"2021-03-11T03:13:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"08da3aaa1dd3dd5dd212353ecead32819e584c62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nonbinaryprogrammer","id":7718000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTgwMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7718000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonbinaryprogrammer","html_url":"https://github.com/nonbinaryprogrammer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonbinaryprogrammer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonbinaryprogrammer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonbinaryprogrammer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonbinaryprogrammer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonbinaryprogrammer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonbinaryprogrammer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonbinaryprogrammer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonbinaryprogrammer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonbinaryprogrammer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"boglesby","id":1002028,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDIwMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002028?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby","html_url":"https://github.com/boglesby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2044162300,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDQ0MTYyMzAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/labels/redis","name":"redis","color":"e6363b","default":false,"description":"Issues

enabled\r\n\r\nWhen the gateway sender is stopped there is a high probability that batches with\r\nincomplete transactions are sent even if group-transaction-events is enabled.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that once the stop command reaches the gateway sender, it immediately\r\nstops queueing events, and this could happen in the middle of receiving events for the\r\nsame transaction. If this is the case, some events for the transaction may have\r\nreached the queue right before the stop command was received and the rest of events\r\nfor that transaction would not make it to the queue (they would be dropped) because\r\nthey arrived right after the stop command was received at the gateway sender.\r\n\r\nOne way to solve this issue is to allow for a grace period when the gateway sender\r\nis stopped during which only events that belong to transactions already\r\nin the queue are queued. Any other event received by the gateway sender\r\nduring this grace period would be dropped. After this grace period\r\nthe gateway sender will be effectively stopped.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

startup-action parameter with values \"stop\", \"pause\" and \"start\" is now persisted\r\nduring the runtime when following commands are issued:\r\n\r\n- pause gateway-sender   --> startup-action=\"pause\"\r\n- stop gateway-sender      --> startup-action=\"stop\"\r\n- start gateway-sender      --> startup-action=\"start\"\r\n- resume gateway-sender --> startup-action=\"start\"\r\n\r\nThe startup-action parameter is persisted within cluster configuration when above gfsh\r\ncommands are executed successfully on at least one of the servers. Parameter is\r\nnot updated and persisted when commands are executed per member as\r\ncluster configuration is not persisted in that case.\r\n\r\nNew startup-action parameter will now inter-work with manual-start in a following way:\r\n\r\n- If manual-start=\"true\" and startup-action parameter is missing, then gateway sender\r\n   will require manual start (same as before).\r\n- if manual-start is not set (or \"false\") and startup-action parameter is missing, then\r\n   gateway sender will be started automatically (same as before).\r\n- If parameter startup-action is available in cluster configuration at startup,\r\n   then gateway-sender will try to reach that state regardless of manual-start\r\n   parameter value.\r\n\r\nThe manual-start is also improved in order to fully comply to above requirement to\r\nstart gateway sender in stopped state.\r\n\r\nCurrent problem with manual-start parameter:\r\n\r\nCurrently, when manual-start is configured to be \"true\", then colocated persistent\r\nparallel gateway sender queue region and buckets are not recovered after server\r\nis restarted. Because of that the main persistent region that is colocated with\r\ngateway sender queue region cannot reach online status.\r\n\r\nSolution to manual-start problem implemented in this commit:\r\n\r\nWhen manual-start parameter is \"true\" or gateway sender startup-action is \"stop\", then\r\npersistent parallel gateway-sender queues will now be recovered (if needed) from\r\npersistent storage during startup of the server. Queues will be recovered by using the\r\nexisting mechanism that is used when gateway sender is automatically recovered\r\n(manual-start==false) after server is restarted. In this case parallel gateway sender\r\nqueue persistent region and buckets are recovered (if needed) right after the main\r\npersistent region and buckets are recovered.\r\n\r\nAdditionally in above case, parallel gateway sender will now reach the same state\r\nthat it has when first started and then stopped by using gfsh command. In that state\r\nparallel gateway sender queue buckets remain on the servers, but dispatcher threads are\r\nstopped and non of the events are stored in queues.","created_at":"2021-02-16T08:04:21Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T22:22:27Z","closed_at":"2022-11-22T22:22:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"959ff78f13766786777215f2b9b89141cd0bf384","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jdeppe-pivotal","id":5313410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTM0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5313410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/jdeppe-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jchen21","id":11181423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTgxNDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11181423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nabarunnag","id":8689859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODk4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8689859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag","html_url":"https://github.com/nabarunnag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"agingade","id":8432880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MzI4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8432880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade","html_url":"https://github.com/agingade","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dschneider-pivotal","id":11197400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTk3NDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11197400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/dschneider-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://
