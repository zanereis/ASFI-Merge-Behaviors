What is this PR for?\n\nUsually in order to push jekyll code to github pages, it will compile using the `--safe`\nOne drawback is that you cannot use any plugins.\n\nAfter working on PR #1356 and introduction a plugin, using the build line with `--safe` specified in the README is failing.\n\nHowever in our case, we are not forced to use that flag, since we are sending the compiled website directly to the Apache SVN, and I was able to confirm that fact when I sent the updated website to the SVN and it was rendered correctly\n\nAlso since plugins like Google Analytics needs to be activated only in production we are adding a special production environment option to add `JEKYLL_ENV=production`\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nDocumentation\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation? No\n","created_at":"2016-09-06T05:30:59Z","updated_at":"2016-09-07T10:47:35Z","closed_at":"2016-09-07T10:47:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"583bee61fece1c923d852498d7727ec3ca00306a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1405/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1405/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1405/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/a5652b1cd71e66c85e98065f372aa12926b676aa","head":{"label":"corneadoug:update/buildCommandLine","ref":"update/buildCommandLine","sha":"a5652b1cd71e66c85e98065f372aa12926b676aa","user":{"login":"corneadoug","id":710411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/710411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug","html_url":"https://github.com/corneadoug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33177730,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzE3NzczMA==","name":"incubator-zeppelin","full_name":"corneadoug/incubator-zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"corneadoug","id":710411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/710411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug","html_url":"https://github.com/corneadoug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/corneadoug/incubator-zeppelin","description":"Mirror

issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1182\n### How should this be tested?\n\nPlease check the log if information on Server host, server path, context path, zeppelin version, class path is available in that file.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation? No\n\nNote:\n    For configuration details such as  zeppelin version, server host, port & context path , these are available as part of zeppelin configuration. \n\nLogging information\n\n```\n INFO [2016-09-02 14:35:25,218] ({main} ZeppelinConfiguration.java[create]:107) - Server Host: 0.0.0.0\n INFO [2016-09-02 14:35:25,218] ({main} ZeppelinConfiguration.java[create]:108) - Server Port: 8080\n INFO [2016-09-02 14:35:25,218] ({main} ZeppelinConfiguration.java[create]:109) - Context Path: /\n INFO [2016-09-02 14:35:25,224] ({main} ZeppelinConfiguration.java[create]:110) - Zeppelin Version: 0.7.0-SNAPSHOT\n```\n\nFor Zeppelin class path and restart information,  I am logging it from Shell script to log file as in below paragraph, So the format of logging is different . I know this is not per standards, Please let me know if you have any suggestions\n\n```\nZeppelin is restarted\n\nZEPPELIN_CLASSPATH:

What is this PR for?\n\nThis implements \"notes per user\" and \"Multiple-users on a single WEB server\" - For implementation reasons (the static fields present on the zeppelin server, and the need for each users to bind/configure their own note to the interpereters managed by the InterpreterFactory), this PR implements both - In other words, it would have been too difficult to decouple both).\n\nI also implements \"User level interpreter setting\".\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Feature]\n### Todos\n- [ ] - More test\n- [ ] - Documentation\n- [ ] - Migration (notebook folder structure changes)\n- [ ] - Discuss the S3, Azure... repo cases\n- [ ] - Check unit tests\n- [ ] - Forsee a \"shared\" notebook workspace to mimick current behavior\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1339\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1000\n### How should this be tested?\n\nLogon / Logout with different users and check that the notes are different.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? N\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? Y\n- Does this needs documentation? Y\n","created_at":"2016-08-31T15:50:36Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T05:23:24Z","closed_at":"2018-05-09T05:23:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cf44d19afd84248b2a0978f0a888a469aab9740c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1390/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1390/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1390/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/dec2a91251fdf9279ed955e648504bf698d12470","head":{"label":"datalayer-attic:multiuser","ref":"multiuser","sha":"dec2a91251fdf9279ed955e648504bf698d12470","user":{"login":"datalayer-attic","id":38213603,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM4MjEzNjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38213603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic","html_url":"https://github.com/datalayer-attic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45792894,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTc5Mjg5NA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"datalayer-attic/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"datalayer-attic","id":38213603,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM4MjEzNjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38213603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic","html_url":"https://github.com/datalayer-attic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/datalayer-attic/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/datalayer-attic/zeppelin","description":":airplane:

What is this PR for?\n\nThe current remote interpreter (launched via shell) is scalable and open but suffers from 2 limitations:\n- It does not allow to easily debug in the IDE.\n- It does not allow to embedd Zeppelin (for small deployements) in a single jar.\n\nA configuration per interpreter \"Remote Interpreter\" (true/false, true by default) is proposed.\nAn additional property `zeppeline.interpreter.remote' in zeppelin-site.xml is also proposed (a new interpreter will be created with that value for it`option.remote` attribute).\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Improvement]\n### Todos\n- [ ] - Value defined in zeppelin-site.xml is not honored when creating a new interepreter\n- [ ] - Unit Test\n- [ ] - Documentatoin\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1395\n### How should this be tested?\n\nLoad Zeppelin source in your IDE and start ZeppelinServer in debug mode\nPut breakpoints in the interpreter sources, Set / Uset the \"Remote Interpeter (see screeenshot).\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![animated-gif](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/226720/18076557/5098c4d6-6e7f-11e6-9309-b93463738957.gif)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? N\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? N\n- Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\n\nSupport table markdown syntax issued by [ZEPPELIN-1387](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1387?jql=project%20%3D%20ZEPPELIN)\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Bug Fix | Improvement]\n\nThis PR can be categorized as bug fix and improvement since it not only resolves the above issue but also support other markdown syntaxes.\n### Todos\n- [ ] - Check the license issue of the [pegdown](https://github.com/sirthias/pegdown) library introduced by this PR\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-1387](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1387?jql=project%20%3D%20ZEPPELIN)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nWrite markdown texts and compare them with expected html DOMs. I'v also included some tests for this PR.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n<img width=\"708\" alt=\"markdown\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4968473/18061274/1f2be526-6e5d-11e6-9f1a-3528f3958d2c.png\">\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?\n- Does coding style is appropriate?\n### Additional Comments\n\nWe might solve this issue by implementing custom table plugin for markdown4j by referring [the existing work of txtmark](https://github.com/zhenchuan/txtmark/commit/178486805e78e3d572b071ca8b9f8887a066edef). \nBut I think it is not good idea in regard to coverage, maintainability and efficiency since markdown4j is currently not developed actively and it costs to implement all markdown plugins which is not supported by markdown4j.\n","created_at":"2016-08-29T17:55:50Z","updated_at":"2016-09-22T00:53:17Z","closed_at":"2016-09-22T00:53:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ec8aefe3e2f8c478a0807261a943360ef67657c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1384/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1384/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1384/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/16cda72ca3f36f10238bbfc2d578f6e1469fc728","head":{"label":"1ambda:fix-zeppelin-1387","ref":"fix-zeppelin-1387","sha":"16cda72ca3f36f10238bbfc2d578f6e1469fc728","user":{"login":"1ambda","id":4968473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4968473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda","html_url":"https://github.com/1ambda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66360806,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjM2MDgwNg==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"1ambda/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"1ambda","id":4968473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4968473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda","html_url":"https://github.com/1ambda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/1ambda/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nSpark2 version of HDP 2.5 is \"2.0.0.2.5.0.0-1245\". Currently, Zeppelin parses this version to integer 2002500, which is higher than version \"2.0.0\" (i.e. 200 in integer). Therefore, Zeppelin thinks it's not supported version and fail.\n\nI fixed some codes to consider major, minor, and patch version. Now, version parsed using only first 3 numbers (major, minor, patch) and parsed into a 5-digit integer. For example, 2.0.0 -> 20000, 1.6.2 -> 10602, 1.10.1 -> 11001. This makes HDP 2.5 compatible, and also make it more robust than before. Since maybe Spark's minor version can be a 2-digit number in the future\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Bug Fix]\n### What is the Jira

What is this PR for?\n\nWhen using Zeppelin behind corporate firewall, sometimes the dependencies download just fails silently. This PR has 2 objectives:\n- add proxy credentials information for dependencies repo\n- raise clear error message in case of dependencies download failure\n\nThere are 3 commits.\n\nThe first one add extra inputs in the form for adding new repository\n\n![add_repo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/18017489/0b486fda-6bd2-11e6-90c7-ceda18c53575.png)\n\nThe second commit fixes some issues and display a clear and explicit error message when download of dependencies fail.\n\nBefore that, when the download fails, we can see the below behaviour\n\n![irrelevant_double_error_message](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/18017541/3cf0de1e-6bd2-11e6-8285-af03f222e8d2.gif)\n- the error message is displayed twice because the call twice the method `checkDownloadingDependencies();`. One in the success callback of:\n\n``` javascript\n $scope.updateInterpreterSetting = function(form, settingId) {\n              ...\n            $http.put(baseUrlSrv.getRestApiBase() + '/interpreter/setting/' + settingId, request)\n              .success(function(data, status, headers, config) {\n                $scope.interpreterSettings[index] = data.body;\n                removeTMPSettings(index);\n                thisConfirm.close();\n                checkDownloadingDependencies();\n                $route.reload();\n              })\n              .error(function(data, status, headers, config) {\n             ...\n    };\n```\n\nAnother call is inside success callback of `getInterpreterSettings()`\n\n``` javascript\nvar getInterpreterSettings = function() {\n      $http.get(baseUrlSrv.getRestApiBase() + '/interpreter/setting')\n      .success(function(data, status, headers, config) {\n        $scope.interpreterSettings = data.body;\n        checkDownloadingDependencies();\n      }).error(function(data, status, headers, config) {\n      ....\n```\n\nThe problem is that `$route.reload();` in the success callback of `updateInterpreterSetting()` will trigger `init()` then `getInterpreterSettings()` so `checkDownloadingDependencies()` is called twice.\n\nI remove the call to `checkDownloadingDependencies()` from success callback of `updateInterpreterSetting()` \n\nThe second modification is on class `DependencyResolver`. In the screen capture above, we get a **cryptic** NullPointerException coming from `DefaultRepositorySystem`. I now catch this NPE to wrap it into a more sensible and clearer exception:\n\n``` java\n\n  public List<ArtifactResult> getArtifactsWithDep(String dependency,\n    Collection<String> excludes) throws RepositoryException {\n    Artifact artifact = new DefaultArtifact(dependency);\n    DependencyFilter classpathFilter = DependencyFilterUtils.classpathFilter(JavaScopes.COMPILE);\n    PatternExclusionsDependencyFilter exclusionFilter =\n            new PatternExclusionsDependencyFilter(excludes);\n\n    CollectRequest collectRequest = new CollectRequest();\n    collectRequest.setRoot(new Dependency(artifact, JavaScopes.COMPILE));\n\n    synchronized (repos) {\n      for (RemoteRepository repo : repos) {\n        collectRequest.addRepository(repo);\n      }\n    }\n    DependencyRequest dependencyRequest = new DependencyRequest(collectRequest,\n            DependencyFilterUtils.andFilter(exclusionFilter, classpathFilter));\n\n //Catch NPE thrown by aether and give a proper error message \n    try {\n      return system.resolveDependencies(session, dependencyRequest).getArtifactResults();\n    } catch (NullPointerException ex) {\n      throw new RepositoryException(String.format(\"Cannot fetch dependencies for %s\", dependency));\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nThe result is much more cleaner\n\n![dependencies_download_error_popup](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/18033855/1be5fe9a-6d2e-11e6-91f9-2f5ea66cab26.gif)\n\nThe last commit is just doc update\n\n![updated_docs](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/18017797/97302f14-6bd3-11e6-97cc-77bd52f25cde.png)\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Improvement]\n### Todos\n- [ ] - Code Review\n- [ ] - Simple test with no Internet connection\n- [ ] - Test within a corporate firewall env with a third-party dependency, requiring download\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n**[ZEPPELIN-1376](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1376)**\n### How should this be tested?\n##### Simple test\n- `git fetch origin pull/1369/head:WebProxy`\n- `git checkout WebProxy`\n- `mvn clean package -DskipTests`\n- `bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh restart`\n- disconnect from the Internet (pull out the cable, shutdown wifi ...)\n- add a random dependency to the Spark interpreter (take `info.archinnov:achilles-core:4.2.2` for example)\n- validate the change, you should see an error popup on the top-right corner saying that Zeppelin cannot download the dependency\n##### Corporate firewall test\n- follow the steps above for simple test\n- create a new repository (see how to **[here](http://localhost:4000/manual/dependencymanagement.html)**) and set the proxy information\n- retry the steps above to ensure that the download is successful\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\nSee above\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? --> **NO**\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? --> **NO**\n- Does this needs documentation?  --> **YES,

What is this PR for?\n\nWe people in Twitter have great demand of adding a flexible drop down menu for the columns in the tables which enables the text/numeric conversion.\nThis is because people want some columns to be of string type which, for example, fits to the underlying DB definition.\nThe use cases of the change include:\n1. For now sorting on the columns is always lexicographically because Zeppelin front end treats the data as strings. It the values in the table can be convertible between string and number then we can sort the column by numeric values. I have filed another ticket for this: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1372\n2. Since the users know more about their data than us it would be nice if we let the users decide what is the real type of their data. It is annoying if user wants the column to be strings but the front end forcefully inserts commas in it. In some scenarios, users may also want to copy/paste the table to somewhere else. If people want to remove the commas before other actions then that will be a nightmare.... \n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Improvement | Feature]\n### Todos\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1371\n### How should this be tested?\n1. Click on the dropdown menu would convert the text/number of that column.\n2. Other functionalities esp. the sorting function should not be affected.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3334391/18445617/76071f8e-78ec-11e6-93a6-fdcf7b85b6e9.png)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3334391/18446601/16cff4f0-78f1-11e6-9fd6-4010b5d77f17.png)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? Probably a noticeable change in UI\n- Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\n\nIf you run a note book having lots of paragraphs and few images and svgs. Every paragraph run sends the complete notebook instead of sending the details of just the executed paragraph. We can see good performance gain if we send only the details of ran paragraph.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Improvement]\n### Todos\n- [ ] - Task\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN/\n- Put link here, and add [ZEPPELIN-_Jira number_] in PR title, eg. [ZEPPELIN-533]\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1364\n### How should this be tested?\n\nCreate a notebook with few large images etc. so that note.json size is around 4 MB.\nRun %sh ls as one paragraph.\nTime take for paragraph to move to pending and finished status will be very high, as the complete note will be sent for each step. If we add this fix the status changes are very fast and smooth.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?\n  No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions?\n  No\n- Does this needs documentation?\n  No\n","created_at":"2016-08-24T13:21:06Z","updated_at":"2017-03-07T03:38:09Z","closed_at":"2017-03-07T03:37:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e8687e5d2d4a38c8d81a400693f7cd7500ab670","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1357/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1357/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1357/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/4a3036e9b728d066a5953915bc9f318f9297208e","head":{"label":"vipul1409:ZEPPELIN-1364","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1364","sha":"4a3036e9b728d066a5953915bc9f318f9297208e","user":{"login":"vipul1409","id":1721630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjE2MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1721630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409","html_url":"https://github.com/vipul1409","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66460624,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjQ2MDYyNA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"vipul1409/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vipul1409","id":1721630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjE2MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1721630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409","html_url":"https://github.com/vipul1409","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vipul1409/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vipul1409/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

Check out the contributing guide - https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nI was extract tarball build 0.6.1.\nand modify configuration for my environment.\nAnd I had completed the setting up and running the Zeppelin, then I connect \"Zeppelin Tutorial\" Notebook.\nAt this time, I meeted an error when running the \"Load data into table\" section in the \"Zeppelin tutorial notebook\".\n\nThen, I had success in modifying the code in this way in order to succeed Zeppelin notebook, I create a PR\n\nHere are some more details.\n1. Setting up Zeppelin\n   1-1. zeppelin-env.sh\n   1-2. zeppelin-site.xml\n   1-3. \"hive-site\" copy to \"$ZEPPELIN_HOME/conf\" dir. \n2. Start up Zeppelin\n3. run paragraph \"Load data into table\" in Zeppelin Tutorial Notebook\n   --> Meet the \"java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError\"\n4. modify \"Utils.java\" source and apply \"Utils.class\" to \"$ZEPPELIN_HOME/interpreter/spark/zeppelin-spark_2.11-0.6.1.jar\"\n5.

What is this PR for?\n\nSupport for plotting PNG images via matplotlib inline for the python interpreter was recently added (#1329). However, these changes did not work for python3 since it handles strings differently. This PR aims to make the inline plotting compatible with both python 2 and 3. \n### What type of PR is it?\n\nBug Fix\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- [ZEPPELIN-1328](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1328)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nIn a python interpreteter cell, make sure the following produce an image:\n\n``` python\n%python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.arange(5)\nplt.plot(x)\nz.show(plt, fmt='png') # Repeat for fmt='svg'\n```\n\nThis should be tested for both python2 and 3 interpreters (via the interpreter settings page). \n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation? No\n","created_at":"2016-08-18T17:54:27Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T13:38:53Z","closed_at":"2016-08-22T13:38:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e24c28d252ea003cbf76d9175a33b980abc42739","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1343/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1343/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1343/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/772313f2daf20f08e7843d17e31b1bf142a5250f","head":{"label":"agoodm:ZEPPELIN-1328","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1328","sha":"772313f2daf20f08e7843d17e31b1bf142a5250f","user":{"login":"agoodm","id":5179430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzk0MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5179430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm","html_url":"https://github.com/agoodm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65423398,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQyMzM5OA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"agoodm/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"agoodm","id":5179430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzk0MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5179430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm","html_url":"https://github.com/agoodm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/agoodm/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrently, Zeppelin's embedded Spark is located under `interpreter/spark/`. \r\nFor whom **builds Zeppelin from source**, this Spark is downloaded when they build the source with [build profiles](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin#spark-interpreter). I think this various build profiles are useful to customize the embedded Spark, but many Spark users are using their own Spark not Zeppelin's embedded one. Nowadays only Spark&Zeppelin beginners use this embedded Spark. For them, there are too many build profiles(it's so complicated i think). \r\nIn case of **Zeppelin binary package**, it's included by default under `interpreter/spark/`. That's why Zeppelin package size is so huge. \r\n\r\n#### New suggestions\r\nThis PR will change the embedded Spark binary downloading mechanism like below.\r\n\r\n1. `./bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh get-spark` or `./bin/zeppelin.sh get-spark`\r\n2. create `ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-spark/` and will download `spark-2.0.1-hadoop2.7.bin.tgz` and untar \r\n3. we can use this local spark without any configuration like before (e.g. setting `SPARK_HOME`)\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n- [x] - trap `ctrl+c` & `ctrl+z` key interruption during downloading Spark\r\n- [x] - test in the different OS \r\n- [x] - update related document pages again after get feedbacks\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1332](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1332)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1. `rm -r spark-dependencies` \r\n2. Apply this patch and build with `mvn clean package -DskipTests`\r\n3. try`bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh get-spark` or `bin/zeppelin.sh get-spark`\r\n4. should be able to run `sc.version` without setting external `SPARK_HOME`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n- `./bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh get-spark`\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh get-spark\r\nDownload spark-2.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz from mirror ...\r\n\r\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\r\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\r\n100  178M  100  178M    0     0  10.4M      0  0:00:17  0:00:17 --:--:-- 10.2M\r\n\r\nspark-2.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7 is successfully downloaded and saved under /Users/ahyoungryu/Dev/zeppelin-development/zeppelin/local-spark\r\n```\r\n- if `ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-spark/spark-2.0.1-hadoop2.7` already exists\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh get-spark\r\nspark-2.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7 already exists under local-spark.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n- Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n- Does this needs documentation? Need to update some related documents (e.g. README.md, spark.md and install.md

What is this PR for?\n\nThis PR adds support for plotting png images using the matplotlib helper function within a python interpreter (eg `z.show()`). The primary motivation for this is due to the overhead incurred from svg images, which can lag the notebooks if multiple, complicated images are generated (for example, multiple filled contour plots). png images are more lightweight, but of course come at a cost of image quality due to them being raster rather than vector like svg. The support for png images is incorporated through the use of a new optional argument to `z.show` called `fmt` which can be one of `'svg'` or `'png'`. The same code that is currently used in show is used for svg images while the code for png images relies on converting the image directly to a byte array and then entering the decoded byte string directly into an HTML image tag. Currently `fmt` defaults to `'png'` but I think we should consider discussing the pros and cons of each option in this PR. \n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-1318](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1318)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nIn a notebook cell, enter:\n\n``` python\n%python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(np.arange(10))\nz.show(plt, fmt=fmt)\n```\n\nWhere `fmt` may be one of `'svg'` or `'png'`, and any other input should result in a `ValueError`. I would also recommend testing the example in the screenshot below. \n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![zeppelin plot](https://puu.sh/qzc4t/b8fcfe856e.png)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation? Yes (if the changes to the `help()` docstring are not sufficient)\n","created_at":"2016-08-12T22:24:58Z","updated_at":"2016-08-14T02:29:05Z","closed_at":"2016-08-14T02:29:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5303ff38ef6ee706af023ee282277d01d8dca9c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1329/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1329/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1329/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/2e9ce4c3da718a08ff0646986560ff57c352940b","head":{"label":"agoodm:ZEPPELIN-1318","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1318","sha":"2e9ce4c3da718a08ff0646986560ff57c352940b","user":{"login":"agoodm","id":5179430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzk0MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5179430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm","html_url":"https://github.com/agoodm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65423398,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQyMzM5OA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"agoodm/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"agoodm","id":5179430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzk0MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5179430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm","html_url":"https://github.com/agoodm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/agoodm/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nWhen attempting to login to a webhdfs file system with credentials as in:\n`https://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>`\n\nWe get a `ava.io.IOException: Server returned HTTP response code: 401 for URL: ....`\n\nThis has to do with how Java authorizes a URL.  A simple fix is applied to handle this. \n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n- [x] - Apply Patch\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nNo JIRA issue, this was required functionality for a use case. I expect others will require this too.\n### How should this be tested?\n\nLogin to a webhdfs that requires authentication.  It works. \n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?\n  No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions?\n  No\n- Does this needs documentation?\n  I don't think so- the intuitive way to pass username/login is https://`user`:`password`@host.

What is this PR for?\n\nWhile running a Notebook using shell, spark, python uses same user as which zeppelin server is running. Which means these interprets have same permission on file system as zeppelin server.\nIMO users should be able to impersonate themselves as a complete security system.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Improvement]\n### Todos\n- [ ] - Update doc\n- [x] - FIX NPEs\n- [x] - FIX CI\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- [ZEPPELIN-1320](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1320)\n### How should this be tested?\n- Enable shiro auth in shiro.ini\n- Add ssh key for the same user you want to try and impersonate (say user1).\n\n```\nadduser user1\nssh-keygen\nssh user1@localhost mkdir -p .ssh\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user1@localhost 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'\n```\n- Start zeppelin server, try and run following in paragraph in a notebook\n- Go to interpreter setting page, and enable \"User Impersonate\" in any of the interpreter (in my example its shell interpreter)\n\n```\n%sh\nwhoami\n```\n\nCheck that it should run as new user, i.e. \"user1\"\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![user impersonate](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/674497/17700306/d9294e80-63e2-11e6-8be8-1c4b84ef5aee.gif)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? no\n-

What is this PR for?\n\nThis is the first step in order to ensure clear text passwords are not stored in the configuration files. To start with this PR will take care of getting AD system password from the .jceks file, configured by the user specified in the shiro.ini file. Going forward the same keystore can be used to read passwords for other systems as well. \n\nIf the hadoopSecurityCredentialPath path is present and not empty in the shiro.ini, then the password is read from the keystore file and it need not be stored inside the shiro.ini file. \n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[ Improvement]\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-530\n### How should this be tested?\n\nCreate a keystore file using the hadoop credential commandline, for this the hadoop commons should be in the classpath\n\n`hadoop credential create activeDirectoryRealm.systempassword -provider jceks://file/user/zeppelin/conf/zeppelin.jceks`\n\nChange the following values in the Shiro.ini file, and uncomment the line:\n\n`activeDirectoryRealm.hadoopSecurityCredentialPath = jceks://file/user/zeppelin/conf/zeppelin.jceks`\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?\n  No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions?\n  No. This is an additional option. \n- Does this needs documentation?\n  Yes\n### Tasks\n- Documentation\n","created_at":"2016-08-10T13:50:19Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T09:18:41Z","closed_at":"2016-08-25T09:18:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7c191e4f4926a9678c8eee9f61ceba193728e157","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1315/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1315/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1315/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/21566759f6bc9c84f63dc50cbc6adc9aea7fc5c1","head":{"label":"rconline:ZEPPELIN-530","ref":"ZEPPELIN-530","sha":"21566759f6bc9c84f63dc50cbc6adc9aea7fc5c1","user":{"login":"rconline","id":606605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjYwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/606605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline","html_url":"https://github.com/rconline","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45905801,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTkwNTgwMQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"rconline/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rconline","id":606605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjYwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/606605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline","html_url":"https://github.com/rconline","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rconline/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rconline/zeppelin","description":"Mirror
