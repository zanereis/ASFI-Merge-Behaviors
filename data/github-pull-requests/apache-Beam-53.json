#26942\r\n\r\nThe underlying issue is that the json and avro writer treat datetime.datetime object without time zone differently. The former assumes it is in local time zone while the latter assumes its UTC.\r\n\r\nThere is not a easy way to fix this discrepancy as change either will introduce a breaking change. For avro, it is not easy to warn user either, because the input PCollection element (dict) is sent to fastavro directly. Beam does not check the dict.\r\n\r\nOne thing we can do here is to add an option to Timestamp.to_utc_datetime to return a time zone aware datetime.datime object. This will work consistently for both json and avro temp file in the use case reported in #26942\r\n\r\nAlso added pydoc for Timestamp.to_utc_datetime.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR makes a compile target to deploy prism in a stand alone fashion.

It uses a JobManagement client directly, so a future change can enable it to point to any JobManagement instance.\r\n  * Uses Go \"html/template\" package to generate static pages on demand.\r\n* Implements the GetJobs and GetPipeline RPCs to the prism management server.\r\n* Minor cleanup to reduce log verbosity when submitting Go SDK jobs.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR fixes an issue with the current toGenericAvroSchema code that prevents the conversion of BigQuery schemas that have a RECORD field of the same name regardless of location within the schema. The problem stems from the fact that the code uses a single flat namespace for all record schemas.\r\n\r\nThis PR runs adds a new namespace parameter to the generation code and replaces the original static method with one that first checks for namespace collisions. If a collision is detected it will use fully qualified namespaces but otherwise default to the legacy flat namespace. This is intended to be minimally disruptive to existing code which may be making assumptions about the flat namespace. Since this code path was never able to generate a schema when there is a collision it should be safe to modify the schema as no user should be relying on that behavior. \r\n\r\nI don't think there's a GitHub issue, but this is a reported problem from some users.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, when we run the [pushAllDockerImages](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/205cbcea9b030ebd5c2dc6bd6479c5c381248aab/build.gradle.kts#L601) task to release, for most container images it pushes 2 tags for the image: `2.XX.0` and `2.XX.0.RCX`. For example, see https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/beam_python3.8_sdk/tags\r\n\r\nFor some images, though, we only publish the `2.XX.0` image. For example, https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/beam_spark3_job_server/tags needed a manual push to get the `2.48.RC2` tag. We should be consistent here.\r\n\r\nThis comes from different configurations of the gradle plugin.\r\n\r\nPlugin - https://github.com/palantir/gradle-docker\r\nExample doing it correctly - https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/205cbcea9b030ebd5c2dc6bd6479c5c381248aab/sdks/java/container/common.gradle#L107\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem. I tested it against some local docker repos (e.g. https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/damccorm/beam_flink1.12_job_server/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated and https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/damccorm/beam_spark3_job_server/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated both show the `test` tag)\r\n\r\nFixes #26956\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

are 2 problems/tasks that need to be addressed before this can be published/merged:\r\n\r\n- [x] Ask infra to add `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` secrets to the beam repo (hopefully we can do this for a release before removing a bunch of people from the docker group)\r\n- [x] Right now, this workflow runs out of space most of the way through ([example](https://github.com/damccorm/beam/actions/runs/5122878704/jobs/9212582481)). We need a docker prune step injected before proceeding.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR enables remote build caching for the Apache Beam project.\r\n\r\nThe ASF Infra team has created a remote build cache node for the Apache Beam project at [beam-cache.apache.org/cache](https://beam-cache.apache.org/cache/). By using this cache node, Apache Beam build times can be decreased by sharing build results across CI build nodes with other nodes and with local builds. The cache node is for use by the Beam project. No other ASF projects will write to this cache node.\r\n\r\nThe cache node is anonymously readable, but is only writeable with a set of credentials for use only in CI builds. These credentials have been pre-configured on the Beam controller for Jenkins at [ci-beam.apache.org](https://ci-beam.apache.org/).\r\n\r\nfixes #26914\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

for Dataflow load test in #26697\r\n\r\nThe reason for a separate PR is that Python Flink load test runs on nightly container (gcr.io/apache-beam-testing/beam_portability/beam_python3.7_sdk:latest), unlike Dataflow test where an sdk_location parameter is passed to runner\r\n\r\nbtw we publish same Python container on two places, e.g.\r\n\r\n- gcr.io/apache-beam-testing/beam_portability/beam_python3.7_sdk:latest \r\n  daily by https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_Publish_Docker_Snapshots/ \r\n\r\n- gcr.io/apache-beam-testing/beam-sdk/beam_python3.7_sdk\r\n  every 4 hours by https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_Publish_Beam_SDK_Snapshots\r\n\r\nThe first place also has java-sdk and go-sdk containers but no longer continuously publishing (last time was in 2022). Shall we also stop publish Python SDK snapshot in this dir and switch to use the ones in gcr.io/apache-beam-testing/beam-sdk ?\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

valuable for Prism to clearly and eagerly fail on pipelines it doesn't support, whenever possible. And since we already have an abundance of integration tests for this, lightly refactor them to be used.\r\n\r\nThis change affects many files, but most of them are is mechanical and aimed at simplifying testing Prism.\r\n\r\nThis is a necessary pre-cursor for finishing up the support in Prism before trying to get other SDKs using Prism.\r\n\r\nChanges herein:\r\n\r\n* Add a `ptest.BuildAndRun`, which accepts a `func(s beam.Scope)`. \r\n  * This testing approach avoids the vestigial \"create pipeline, and then execute it\", given we hang everything off of the scope. See https://s.apache.org/no-beam-pipeline for rationale, but this may evolve before it becomes a standard around runner wrappers.\r\n  * Light refactor to many of the integration test pipelines to be built in a `func(s beam.Scope)` to be able to use `ptest.BuildAndRun`.\r\n    * Not done to all integration tests yet, just the ones Prism doesn't yet support.\r\n* Delete the long decommissioned and unused \"driver\" main for integration tests.\r\n* Fail jobs on unimplemented features. \r\n  * Reasons for failures are clearly related through the Create Job failure message.\r\n  * Explicitly check windowing strategies vs the Go SDK default settings, since they aren't yet handled by prism.\r\n  * Explicitly check each PTransform URN against a set list to filter out unknown \"standard\" transforms. \r\n    * This avoids pipelines spuriously passing with transforms like TestStream, PubSub.\r\n* Makes prism tests set the JobName from the test name, so it's obvious what test case is being run.\r\n\r\nDiscovered weird/broken behavior WRT flatten handling. To be resolved at a later time.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Resolves #26844 \r\n\r\nSee this stage: http://apache-beam-website-pull-requests.storage.googleapis.com/26860/index.html\r\n\r\nWith the root cause in Safari is still not found, this PR eliminates the change of the iframe's src at runtime. Instead of being in the static HTML, the playground iframes are now created in `language-switch-v2.js` file when the tabs are created. This solves the problem in Safari. This should improve performance a bit because we no longer interrupt iframes that started loading.\r\n\r\nAlso we had Playground not shown on mobile website, and only a screenshot instead. The click on the screenshot opens the standalone playground.\r\n\r\nWith Playground being used in examples in docs, it is no longer an option, although the mobile Playground is still unusable for edits and runs. So this PR shows playground instances even on mobile, unless they are in a `<div class=\"playground_or_image\">` (on a home page).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
