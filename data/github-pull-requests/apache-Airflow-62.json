The two classes are moved from `airflow.models.datasets` to `airflow.datasets` since the intention is to use them with Dataset, not DatasetModel. It is more natural for users to import from the latter module instead.\r\n\r\nA new (abstract) base class is added for the two classes, plus the OG Dataset class, to inherit from. This allows us to replace a few isinstance checks with simple molymorphism and make the logic a bit simpler.\r\n\r\nSome minor changes are required to satisfy the linter. \r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

However it might be not safe to use it in core, because it might create cyclic error in case if it imported somewhere else during first load, e.g. into the `airflow.configurations` or `airflow.settings` or their imports. In providers it is not practical to use it, you have to wait approx one year for allow to use it, and it also might be a reason for cyclic errors, e.g. if it use in secrets backends and their imports.\r\n\r\nFor avoid usage in project it disabled by `TID251` - Banned API\r\nAll current usage, most in tests, replaced by `sys.version_info`\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the

It allows for the registration of dataset events, enabling more dynamic tracking and management of datasets within Airflow workflows. The changes include modifications to API endpoints, schema definitions, dataset managers, security permissions, and corresponding unit tests to ensure functionality and security compliance.\r\n\r\nChanges\r\n- API Endpoints: Added a new post endpoint (post_dataset_event) to dataset_endpoint.py for creating dataset events, along with necessary security checks and action logging.\r\n- OpenAPI Specification: Updated the openapi/v1.yaml file to include the new post endpoint under /datasets/events, including request and response schema definitions.\r\n- Dataset Manager: Modified manager.py to support registering dataset changes without a task instance and to return a DatasetEvent object.\r\n- Security Permissions: Updated security_manager/override.py to include create permissions for the dataset resource.\r\n- UI and Types: Adjusted JavaScript components and API-generated types to accommodate the new changes.\r\n- Unit Tests: Added comprehensive tests in test_dataset_endpoint.py and test_dataset_schema.py to cover the new endpoint functionality and schema validation.\r\n\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party

This function is ONLY called within the `get_job_description` function that allows for retries; however, there is only handling of `botocore.exceptions.ClientError` error in this function.\r\n\r\nThis means, that if AWS simply fails to provide the job description - if there is a delay in AWS to register job information, this function will immediate fail instead of trying. This may happen under certain conditions, especially when using the `batch` operators for submitting jobs which immediately use returned `job_id` to query for the job information - but again, if AWS fails to register the job description in time - this will cause an unnecessary failure in Airflow side of things.\r\n\r\nThe proposed change allows `parse_job_description` to return `None` instead of raising if zero jobs are returned by AWS. Similarly, if more than one matching job is returned, the function will provide the description of the first job.\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-19T19:47:55Z","updated_at":"2024-04-11T00:12:06Z","closed_at":"2024-04-11T00:12:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ef2f56ea20f422782659889dcb105a84e16cedc3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eladkal","id":45845474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODQ1NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45845474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal","html_url":"https://github.com/eladkal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"o-nikolas","id":65743084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzQzMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65743084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas","html_url":"https://github.com/o-nikolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

PR adds secret caching for the Airflow CLI. [Secret caching](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#use-cache) current only works for the DAG-processing job, but is ignored when parsing the files through the CLI. This currently causes slow response times from the Airflow CLI for DAGs that use top-level variables.\r\n\r\nBy initializing the cache as part of the CLI startup, we make sure the cache is enabled properly for parsing. If the user did not configure caching explicitly, the added cache initialization is a no-op and the behavior is the same as before.\r\n\r\ncloses: #37543 \r\n\r\nI did not add a test case yet because I did not find an existing one for `__main__.main()` yet. I am open for suggestions on how to properly test the added caching, however since this is a very small change that does not change behavior until explicitly configured we may be good without one.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

A few notes:\r\n\r\n- `ObjectStoragePath._accessor._store` was keeping an `ObjectStore` instance reference just for retrieving the `conn_id`. The current refactor does not keep the store instance referenced, since the conn_id is available in the storage_options of the UPath instance.\r\n- The `__hash__` method was previously decorated with `lru_cache`, which is bad, because it keeps a reference to each ObjectStoragePath instance in the cache dict (stored on the class), preventing cleanup.\r\n- There were a few unused slots `_bucket`, `_key`, etc.. that seemed to be leftovers from a previous implementation.\r\n\r\nTagging: @potiuk @bolkedebruin \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add

#36270 \r\n\r\nAvoid malicious scripts by escaping html tags in the different fields. This does not apply to the password because it is not a string field.\r\n\r\nPrevious attempt PR: #37316 \r\n\r\nMy previous attempt used a new validator to raise an exception if there were html tags, but now they are simply escaped. This allows the user to still put in the tags, but they will be showed as text instead of rendered (or worse executed in the case of a <script>)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I have used the most recent version of the main branch possible to avoid the conflicts that were previously present.\r\n\r\nThanks again @potiuk and @hussein-awala for your feedback.

am observing an issue wrt to the recent deferrable KPO \r\nchanges in PR https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/37279 and https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/37454, \r\nwhere when the pod fails to start within a specified timeout value, \r\nthe KPO task is hanging forever whereas it is expected to fail after the \r\ntimeout. This PR fixes the issue by correcting a logical error for \r\ndetecting if elapsed timeout has occurred for raising the timeout \r\ntrigger event.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

The [next line](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/e9730daeee557838bb3029d00c17699afa3e95bb/airflow/providers/cncf/kubernetes/operators/pod.py#L710-L711) is the raise anyways. It's just a bit confusing to the user.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the missing message KeyError so that we see the proper exception getting raised:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1126\" alt=\"image\"

closes #37091.\r\n\r\nIn particular, dynamically mapped tasks currently show as `failed_upstream` instead of `skipped` if some of the tasks that generate the mapping are skipped and the trigger rule is `none_failed`, `all_done` or similar.\r\n\r\nThis is because when trying to expand the mapped task, a failed and skipped mapped dependency behave identically and both result in a NotFullyPopulated being raised.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new task instance dependency that sets a dynamically mapped task to `skipped` if any of the mapped dependencies are skipped (but not failed) and to `upstream_failed` if any of the mapped dependencies are failed. As such, an expansion of the mapped task is never attempted.\r\n\r\nBefore (from

PR adds the (missing) option reported as Bug a while ago that the DAG trigger form can be called with default values populated.\r\n\r\nHow to test:\r\n- Run the web UI on this branch, see that forms are displayed\r\n- Call the UI, e.g. DAG `example_params_ui_tutorial` and add URL parameters and see fields are pre-populated, e.g. `/dags/example_params_ui_tutorial/trigger?required_field=some text`\r\n- Check that boolean, objects and lists are also working e.g. via\r\n    - `flag=true` or `flag=false`\r\n    - `array_of_numbers=[17,18,19]`\r\n    - `object={\"x\":789}`\r\n    - `run_id=manual__12345` (and expand the lower section seeing run_id being pre-populated)\r\n    - `text=<script>alert(1)</script>` (and see that it is not possible to XSS a value in)\r\n\r\ncloses:

#37362 introduced --install-airflow-with-constraints flag to be able to check FAB provider installation in CI, but the value of that flag was falee for `shell` and `start-airlfow` command - and there was a mistake in the condition installing airlfow that if that flag was not set AND providers were not installed together, airflow was not installed at all - resulting in `missing airflow.__main`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it - the flag is set to true also the condition for installation is such that even if providers are not installed, airflow will be installed without constraints if\r\n--install-airflow-with-constraints flag is not set.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

utilize the existing implementation of `_CredentialsToken` by using the async hook's `get_token` method. This implementation allows us to leverage several features of the Google connection from `Keyfile Path` or `Keyfile JSON` (see #37081) to impersonation chain on hook or connection level. We therefore do not need to rely on the async hook's `service_file_as_context` method, which does not support impersonation chain.\r\n\r\nWith this change we effectively gain support for impersonation

DAGs accept a [`Collection[\"Dataset\"]`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/0c02ead4d8a527cbf0a916b6344f255c520e637f/airflow/models/dag.py#L171) as an option for the `schedule`, but that collection cannot be a `set` because Datasets are not a hashable type. The interesting thing is that [the `DatasetModel` is actually already hashable](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/dec78ab3f140f35e507de825327652ec24d03522/airflow/models/dataset.py#L93-L100), so this introduces a bit of duplication since it's mostly the same implementation. However, Airflow users are primarily interfacing with `Dataset`, not `DatasetModel` so I think it makes sense for `Dataset` to be hashable. I'm not sure how to square the duplication or what `__eq__` and `__hash__` provide for `DatasetModel` though.\r\n\r\nThere was discussion on the original PR that created the `Dataset` (https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/24613) about whether to create two classes or one. In that discussion @kaxil mentioned:\r\n\r\n> I would slightly favour a separate `DatasetModel` and `Dataset` so `Dataset` becomes an extensible class, and `DatasetModel` just stores the info about the class. So users don't need to care about SQLAlchmey stuff when extending it.\r\n\r\nThat first PR created the `Dataset` model as both SQLAlchemy and user space class though. It wasn't until later on (https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/25727) that the `DatasetModel` got broken out from `Dataset` and one became two. That provides a bit of background on why they both exist for anyone reading this who is curious.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/37279 I introduce periodic logging of the container.\r\nDuring the process, I also changed a few event Dict key names\r\nand that is problematic for someone

also emit an event even if the pod is in the pod intermediate state.\r\none reported issue: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/37279#issuecomment-1938757838\r\nIn this PR I'm restoring the trigger
