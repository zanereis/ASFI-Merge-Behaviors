configured coordinator with rather small interval (druid.coordinator.period=PT5S) to make new segments loaded in a few seconds. That made coordinator very busy on sorting segments (we have 200K segments) to check unneeded/overshadowed segments, which seemed occur very intermittently.\n\nThis patch consists 4 parts,\n1. Minor improvement of Comparator of Interval not to make DateTime for each compare when two interval has the same chronology\n2. Makes some works (cleanups and balancing) not run every coordinator period\n3. Cache immutable view of DruidServer when nothing is changed for the server\n4. Related to 2.

PR adds support for deserializing [Confluent's Schema Registry](https://github.com/confluentinc/schema-registry) encoded avro (see [documentation](http://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/docs/)) in the [druid-avro-extension](http://druid.io/docs/latest/development/extensions-core/avro.html). \n\nSchema Registry's binary prefix is different from schemarepo and only contains the schema ID (1 `null` byte + 4-byte `int` ID).\n\nThis submission only adds the `io.confluent:kafka-schema-registry-client:3.0.1` dependency to the `druid-avro-extension` module (no transitive ones).\n\nIt was tested on some of our Avro-encoded Kafka topics.\n\nIdeally, we'd like to backport this to the 0.9.1.x branch since we use Imply Druid's distribution (currently stuck to Druid 0.9.1.1).

initial version of the supervisor was single-threaded which worked well enough in general but resulted in poor responsiveness when HTTP requests to the index task ChatHandlers didn't return in a timely fashion. The main change in this PR is to issue HTTP requests to multiple tasks simultaneously to improve the responsiveness of the supervisor. The overall coordination logic has not been changed.\n\nSummary of changes:\n\n**KafkaIndexTaskClient**\n- add better logging\n- make retries and timeouts configurable\n- add ListenableFuture async wrapper methods\n\n**KafkaSupervisor**\n- change concurrently accessed data structures to concurrent variants\n- separate issuing of HTTP requests (through KafkaIndexTaskClient) and supervision logic so that we can send parallel HTTP requests without waiting for responses and then wait on the responses as a group instead of sequentially\n\n**Testing**\n- existing tests all pass with minor modifications mainly to support new mock expectations\n- added new tests to test async KafkaIndexTaskClient methods; tests run parameterized with single/multiple threads\n- added additional tests to KafkaSupervisor to test expected handling of unresponsive tasks and graceful shutdown behavior\n- added basic integration test for Kafka indexing service to test task creation, handoff, and proper offset continuation between tasks\n\nHas been running for a few days in our test cluster with no related issues. \n\nFixes #3197

working on sql on druid, when we transform such sql\n `select * from someDataSource where (time > '20160801 010000' and time < '20160801 100000' and dimA='xxx') or (time > '20160801 110000 ' and time <= '20160801 160000' and dimA='yyy')` \nto a druid query, we need 2 things from druid:\n1: the timestampSpec info (done in another PR): the timestamp column and format, then we can know the 'time' range can be transformed to 'intervals':['2016-08-01 01:00:00/2016-08-01 10:00:00', '2016-08-01 11:00:00/2016-08-01 16:00:00']\n\n``` json\n\"timestampSpec\": {\n  \"column\": \"time\",\n  \"format\": \"yyyyMMdd HHmmss\"\n}\n```\n\n2: the ability to do complex filter on time.\n\nWhen ingestion, the timestamp column defined in timestampSpec is explicit excluded in dimension list because of the need of rollup, this patch adds the timestamp column back, but with truncated value according to queryGranularity and in origin format, in other word, it is the dimension version of __time.\n\nIf queryGranularity is set to 'HOUR', the original value is '20160801 013556', the final value in row is '20160801 010000'.\n\nThis feature is very useful when filtering by complex time range which 'intervals' can't represent(but still can use intervals to narrow down to less segments), like the above example.\n\nThe above query can be transformed to BoundDimFilter on 'time' or IntervalDimFilter on __time within an OrDimFilter.\nBut for a sql like\n`select * from someDataSource where time > '201608' and time < '201609'`, we can't use IntervalDimFilter due to the '201608' is not in pattern 'yyyyMMdd HHmmss' and we don't have another pattern to parse the '201608' string to a valid representation that the `Interval` class can understand.\n\nTo use this feature, just set the option includeTruncatedTimestampColumnAsDimension=true in dimensionsSpec in DataSchema:\n\n```\n\"parser\": {\n  \"type\": \"string\",\n  \"parseSpec\": {\n    \"timestampSpec\": {\n      \"column\": \"time\",\n      \"format\": \"iso\"\n    },\n    \"dimensionsSpec\": {\n      \"includeTruncatedTimestampColumnAsDimension\": true,\n      \"dimensions\": [\n        \"appId\",\n        \"containerId\",\n        \"cluster\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"format\": \"json\"\n
