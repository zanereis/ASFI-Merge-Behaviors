two inputs: the 0D constant `flatten_1/stack/0` and a 0D tensor  `flatten_1/Prod`. Currently, the TF frontend cannot handle this model because it turns the 0D constant `flatten_1/stack/0` into a 1D constant of dimension

PR extends the TFLite runtime to support edgeTPU-equipped Coral boards in order to measure inference time of models on edgeTPU with TVM RPC.\r\n\r\n## Instructions to run the EdgeTPU runtime experiments\r\n\r\n### Coral Board setup\r\nYou'll need to follow these instructions: https://coral.ai/docs/dev-board/get-started/\r\n```\r\n# Clone TensorFlow, and prepare the library dir\r\n# Note the older version of TF that we'll need to use\r\ngit clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow --recursive --branch=1.8.0\r\ncd tensorflow\r\nmkdir tensorflow/lite/tools/make/gen\r\nmkdir tensorflow/lite/tools/make/gen/generic-aarch64_armv8-a\r\nmkdir tensorflow/lite/tools/make/gen/generic-aarch64_armv8-a/lib\r\n\r\n# TF dependence\r\ncd ~ && git clone

https://github.com/google-coral/edgetpu.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Cross compile tflite static library on x86 machine\r\n```\r\n# Prerequisites \r\nsudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get install crossbuild-essential-arm64\r\n\r\n# cross-compile tflite library (note you need to use older version)\r\ngit clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git --recursive --branch=1.8.0\r\ncd

Build TVM runtime on Coral Board\r\n```\r\ncd ~ && git clone --recursive --branch=master https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm.git tvm\r\ncd tvm && mkdir build && cp cmake/config.cmake build\r\necho 'set(USE_GRAPH_RUNTIME_DEBUG ON)' >> build/config.cmake\r\necho 'set(USE_TFLITE ON)' >> build/config.cmake\r\necho 'set(USE_TENSORFLOW_PATH /home/mendel/tensorflow)' >> build/config.cmake\r\necho 'set(USE_EDGETPU /home/mendel/edgetpu)' >> build/config.cmake\r\ncd build && cmake ..\r\nmake runtime -j4\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Execute the RPC server on Coral\r\nFirst, follow this guide to set up a tracker for your remote devices: https://docs.tvm.ai/tutorials/autotvm/tune_relay_arm.html#start-rpc-tracker.\r\nOn the coral, once TVM runtime has been built, execute:\r\n```\r\nPYTHONPATH=/home/mendel/tvm/python:$PYTHONPATH python3 -m tvm.exec.rpc_server --tracker $TVM_TRACKER_HOST:$TVM_TRACKER_NODE --key coral\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Evaluate MobileNet on Coral board\r\n\r\nExecute the following python script:\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nimport tvm\r\nfrom tvm import autotvm, relay\r\nfrom tvm.contrib import tflite_runtime\r\n\r\ntarget = \"cpu\"\r\n\r\n# Note: replace \"tracker\" and 9191 with your tracker host and port name\r\nremote = autotvm.measure.request_remote(\"coral\", \"tracker\", 9191, timeout=60)\r\nctx = remote.cpu(0)\r\n\r\nif target == \"edge_tpu\":\r\n    tflite_fp = \"mobilenet_v2_1.0_224_quant_edgetpu.tflite\"\r\nelse:\r\n    tflite_fp = \"mobilenet_v2_1.0_224_quant.tflite\"\r\ninput_data = np.random.rand(1,224,224,3).astype(\"uint8\")\r\nwith open(tflite_fp, 'rb') as f:\r\n    runtime = tflite_runtime.create(f.read(), ctx, runtime_target=target)\r\n    runtime.set_input(0, tvm.nd.array(input_data, ctx))\r\n    ftimer = runtime.module.time_evaluator(\"invoke\", ctx,\r\n            number=10,\r\n            repeat=3)\r\n    times = np.array(ftimer().results) * 1000\r\n    print(\"It took {0:.2f}ms to run mobilenet\".format(np.mean(times)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpon running it, you'll get:\r\n`It took 143.74ms to run mobilenet`\r\n\r\nNow, set `target = \"edge_tpu\"` and you'll get:\r\n`It took 3.22ms to run mobilenet`\r\n\r\n## Notable interface changes\r\n\r\n* The TFLite runtime API does not expose the `allocate()` method anymore, and tensor allocation is done as part of the initialization process.","created_at":"2020-01-13T20:33:26Z","updated_at":"2023-11-08T00:18:22Z","closed_at":"2020-01-16T20:20:43Z","merged_at":"2020-01-16T20:20:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"31021d2b99fbea92df9c1cd17648b23304f29f6b","assignee":{"login":"ZihengJiang","id":17693755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjkzNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17693755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihengJiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"ZihengJiang","id":17693755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjkzNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17693755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihengJiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

PR fixed an issue in updating `uop_idx` counter in the `TensorGemm` module.\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nWhen evaluating `deploy_vision_on_vta.py` with TSIM backend, it is required to run the module with\r\n```python\r\nm.run()\r\n```\r\nHowever, it throws an instance of `dmlc::Error`, saying\r\n```\r\nvirtual_memory.cc:48: Check failed: phy_addr != 0 (0 vs. 0) : trying to get address that is nullptr\r\n```\r\nThe root cause is that `uop_idx` increases unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the above issue and enables successful evaluation of `deploy_vision_on_vta.py` with TSIM

in Progress: Do not merge.  \r\n\r\nF82 tests are almost always _undefined names_ which are usually a sign of a typo, missing imports, or code that has not been ported to Python 3.  These also would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in Python a __NameError__ is raised which will halt/crash the script on the user. \r\n\r\nThis test on this repo raises a lot of false reports because it gets really confused by the [HYBRID_GLOBALS](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/python/tvm/hybrid/runtime.py#L113) approach of adding globals without declaring them as globals in the local scope.  (This could be overcome by adding them as `--builtins=` in the flake8 command.)\r\n\r\nHowever, there are other undefined names that are not in HYBRID_GLOBALS that should be addressed such as the missing import of tensorflow.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

by #4685, #4686, #4689~\r\n\r\nhttps://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html\r\n\r\nOn the flake8 test selection, this PR does _not_ focus on \"_style violations_\" (the majority of flake8 error codes that [__psf/black__](https://github.com/psf/black) can autocorrect).  Instead these tests are focus on runtime safety and correctness:\r\n* E9 tests are about Python syntax errors usually raised because flake8 can not build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).  Often these issues are a sign of unused code or code that has not been ported to Python 3.  These would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in a dynamic language like Python they result in the script halting/crashing on the user.\r\n* F63 tests are usually about the confusion between identity and equality in Python.  Use ==/!= to compare str, bytes, and int literals is the classic case.  These are areas where __a == b__ is True but __a is b__ is False (or vice versa).  Python >= 3.8 will raise SyntaxWarnings on these instances.\r\n* F7 tests logic errors and syntax errors in type hints\r\n* F82 tests are almost always _undefined names_ which are usually a sign of a typo, missing imports, or code that has not been ported to Python 3.  These also would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in Python a __NameError__ is raised which will halt/crash the script on the user.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

PR migrates relay's Op into the ir folder.\r\nOp and its registry provides an useful mechanism to\r\nstore any attribute meta-data of an operator include\r\nfunction signatures, lowering rules, side effect etc.\r\n\r\nThese features are not only useful for Relay, but also needed in the low-level IR.\r\nAt the current moment, intrinsic functions in the low-level IR are simply\r\nrepresented by a string. This means we cannot type-check the low-level IR\r\nwhen the type does not meet the constraint, nor can we obtain further\r\ninformation such as side-effect and read write relation of these intrinsics\r\nwrt to arguments.\r\n\r\nOp will be used as the way to handle primitive ops(in DL terminology)\r\n(builtin intrinsics or in compiler terminology).\r\nWe will perform follow-up refactors to make low-level CallNode\r\ntake Op as the function argument.","created_at":"2020-01-11T02:40:14Z","updated_at":"2020-02-10T19:25:56Z","closed_at":"2020-01-11T21:02:29Z","merged_at":"2020-01-11T21:02:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"d8f06020a10deb25722c9f97363368e8ae1c2b62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4687/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4687/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4687/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/a27313a158f45911fdf2fb627fa23d2370057327","head":{"label":"tqchen:op","ref":"op","sha":"a27313a158f45911fdf2fb627fa23d2370057327","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/dow

discussion).\r\n\r\nThis is a minimum change we can do to unify the classes into a common hierarchy.\r\nThe main data structure that are variant specific will still be kept in the

is one prior work of[ Module based Model Runtime Interface RFC](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/discuss-module-based-model-runtime-interface/5025). In this RFC, we want to serialize params (weight) into shared library directly. \r\n\r\nHowever, previous way of serializing the blob is to use `PackImportToC`, i.e. we will serialize the blob into char array `__tvm_dev_blob`, which stored the serialized result (0x...0x...), then we write this into `dev.cc` and pass to the compiler compiling. If we don't serialize params, it is ok. However, when we serialize params, the `__tvm_dev_blob` and `dev.cc` will become very large (resnet18 workload of `dev.cc` will be 380M, without serializing weight is 2.6M). The compiling time will increase very much (**Even 10x slower**). \r\n\r\nAccording to the investigation, the bottleneck is the parsing time (see [GCC time report](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/discuss-module-based-model-runtime-interface/5025/5?u=frozengene)).\r\n\r\nSo we decide to avoid the C++ compiler (i.e. avoid the parsing time) and generate LLVM module directly. After testing, even we we serialize the params into shared library, the compiling time of generating blob is very fast. The compiling time of resnet18 on one cloud machine I tested before could **boost from 128.46s to 13.28s**. see[ previous test](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/discuss-module-based-model-runtime-interface/5025/17?u=frozengene)\r\n\r\nAfter this work, I find it also have some a little improvement of compiling time compared previous way testing on my local machine (Intel i7-7700 CPU @ 3.60GHz). \r\n\r\nWorkload is restnet18 on CUDA. Run 10 times and get the average\r\n\r\n| PackImportToC | PackImportToLLVM |\r\n| ---------------------| ----------------|\r\n| 8.586s             | 8.082s      |\r\n\r\n@tqchen @zhiics @yzhliu

defining tensors that can take on a dynamic shape a typical way would be to use var as follows:\r\n```\r\nA = tvm.var(dtype='int32')\r\nC = tvm.compute((A,A), lambda i : 0)\r\nsch = tvm.create_schedule(C.op)\r\nf = tvm.build(sch,[A, C])\r\n```\r\nAn equivalent program using a placeholder instead of a var can be written as follows:\r\n```\r\nA = tvm.placeholder((1,1), dtype='int32',name=\"A\")\r\nC = tvm.compute((A[0,0],A[0,0]), lambda i : 0)  \r\nsch = tvm.create_schedule(C.op)  \r\nf = tvm.build(sch,[A, C])  \r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, despite these programs having identical functionality an error is produced when attempting to build which is due to the assertions of the following form being added:\r\n```\r\nassert((A(0, 0) == float32(arg2.shape[0])), \"Argument arg2.shape[0] has an unsatisfied constraint\")\r\n```\r\nThe salient piece of the assertion is `A(0,0)` which is a Call node with `call_type=Call::Halide` that codegen is unable to handle.  Normally these calls are replaced with a load during the StorageFlatten pass. In this case since `A(0,0)` is one of the expressions defining the buffer shape it does not pass through StorageFlatten. This is because it is materalized in assertions created by `ArgBinder::BindDLTensor` which occurs after the passes.\r\n\r\nThis goal of this pull request is to illustrate a fix which is to flatten the shapes of buffers as they are created. After this fix is introduced the above placeholder code snippets can compile and run as expected. I'm not convinced this fix is the ideal way to handle this issue so I would appreciate any suggestions for improvements to this approach. \r\n\r\nThe original thread stating this bug can be found [here](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/tvm-compute-with-variable-shape-fails-to-build/4648).\r\n\r\n@yzhliu @tqchen @zhiics\r\n\r\nEDIT: It appears that the commits replayed when merging so I apologize for the messiness.

the signature of LibraryModule's PackedFunc does not support return value.\r\nThis wasn't a limitation for our current usecase but could become one\r\nas we start to generate more interesting functions.\r\n\r\nThis feature will start to get interesting as we move towards unified\r\nobject protocol and start to pass object around.\r\nThis PR enhances the function signature to allow return values.\r\n\r\nWe also created two macros TVM_DLL_EXPORT_PACKED_FUNC and TVM_DLL_EXPORT_TYPED_FUNC\r\nto allow manual creation of functions that can be loaded by a LibraryModule.\r\n\r\nExamples are

we use a tvm::Var to represent a placeholder for shapes in generic types.\r\nThis is not necessary for GlobalTypeVar(as we never parameterize by shape var),\r\nand is a bit twisted for TypeVar.\r\n\r\nAs we move to a unified type system, we want to break the dependency\r\nfrom the base TypeVar(which is shared across the languages) from the expression.\r\nNote that it is fine for TensorType to depend on Expr.\r\n\r\nOne alternative solution to embed the Var would be to introduce a TypeVarExpr,\r\nwhich can wrap a TypeVar as Expr. However, this new alternative won't be\r\nnatural until we migrate the type to the global scope.\r\nGiven that have not yet start to depend on the shape parameterization heavily yet, we propose to carry out the TypeVar change first.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the tvm::Var from the typevars. We will follow up with another\r\nPR to migrate the types to a base location. After that, we should be able to\r\nuse the more elegant approach via
