your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-19T15:13:45Z","updated_at":"2018-06-07T20:18:09Z","closed_at":"2018-06-07T20:18:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eda0f2635194fb125dffbe8b642ef605c0f2b97a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4894/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4894/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4894/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/561dd0ffea7e8a781a123383e4173f0484d31237","head":{"label":"rmannibucau:fix/BEAM-3876_npe-check-for-unbounded-source-in-direct-runner","ref":"fix/BEAM-3876_npe-check-for-unbounded-source-in-direct-runner","sha":"561dd0ffea7e8a781a123383e4173f0484d31237","user":{"login":"rmannibucau","id":1249546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDk1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1249546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau","html_url":"https://github.com/rmannibucau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61496225,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTQ5NjIyNQ==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"rmannibucau/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rmannibucau","id":1249546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDk1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1249546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau","html_url":"https://github.com/rmannibucau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rmannibucau/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [X] What the pull request does\r\n   - [X] Why it does it\r\n   - [X] How it does it\r\n   - [X] Why this approach\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue with the current logic is that if `delayedUntil` timestamp is equal to the current time when `shouldFire` method is called than `shouldFire` method returns false and trigger doesn't fire and  never fires again unless there is some new element for the the same <key, window> or allowed lateness is hit. In reality when I tested with Flink runner on a cluster it's very likely on the powerful enough machines that it's actually the same millisecond timer fires at `delayedUntil` timestamp and  calls a method `public void onTimers(Iterable<TimerData> timers) throws Exception` from `ReduceFnRunner` and the time current time is probed via `getCurrentTime(context)` in `AfterDelayFromFirstElementStateMachine.shouldFire()` method. The suggested fix is to check if current timestamp is equal or greater than `delayedUntil` timestamp.\r\n\r\nI created a test job that replicates the issue: https://github.com/pbartoszek/BEAM-3863_late_trigger \r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-16T16:34:43Z","updated_at":"2018-12-11T17:49:04Z","closed_at":"2018-06-24T12:33:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4df3b4a761b564382efde6a7a78606355cbf99e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":974794430,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzQ3OTQ0MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4875/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4875/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4875/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/0f9ad56bb113af16e3f67c10326938eec247f5b4","head":{"label":"pbartoszek:BEAM-3863","ref":"BEAM-3863","sha":"0f9ad56bb113af16e3f67c10326938eec247f5b4","user":{"login":"pbartoszek","id":8142131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNDIxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8142131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek","html_url":"https://github.com/pbartoszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":117852363,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTc4NTIzNjM=","name":"beam","full_name":"pbartoszek/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pbartoszek","id":8142131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNDIxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8142131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek","html_url":"https://github.com/pbartoszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbartoszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pbartoszek/beam","description":"Apache

is the first part of work to enable Python streaming end-to-end test. Changes include:\r\n\r\n- Improved test runner to make sure that test execution is unblocked after job is submitted successfully and start running. This only applies to streaming tests.\r\n- `streaming_wordcount_it_test.py` is created as an example of end-to-end streaming test. The test runs `streaming_wordcount.py` and publish numbers to PubSub as test data. Currently, the test only verifies that job can successfully enter RUNNING state.\r\n- Add few PubSub utils.\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n- currently, `streaming_wordcount_it_test` needs to be manually terminate, otherwise, it'll run forever.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- Add verifier to the test to check output PubSub messages are expected.\r\n- Auto-cancel pipeline in end-to-end test for streaming.\r\n- Improve wait_until_running condition.\r\n\r\nFollowing changes are made in another [PR](https://github.com/markflyhigh/incubator-beam/pull/2).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-15T21:28:43Z","updated_at":"2018-03-21T01:58:52Z","closed_at":"2018-03-21T01:58:52Z","merged_at":"2018-03-21T01:58:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"776fd5a6ae21352a20c388ecf23822e6def13854","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4874/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4874/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4874/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/f75cc044f8f7693b3c20d8193ba3fff9b3f77c79","head":{"label":"markflyhigh:py-swc-it","ref":"py-swc-it","sha":"f75cc044f8f7693b3c20d8193ba3fff9b3f77c79","user":{"login":"markflyhigh","id":4008895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDg4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4008895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh","html_url":"https://github.com/markflyhigh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61327747,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTMyNzc0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"markflyhigh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"markflyhigh","id":4008895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDg4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4008895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh","html_url":"https://github.com/markflyhigh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/markflyhigh/beam","description":"Apache

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-15T17:02:34Z","updated_at":"2018-03-30T19:44:21Z","closed_at":"2018-03-30T19:44:21Z","merged_at":"2018-03-30T19:44:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"6b32a9ede49b312a324c4d1c5d091283b8050fe1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4873/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4873/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4873/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/2f188e34a3ac717df46021df5591e3b2580d96e2","head":{"label":"robertwb:runner-run","ref":"runner-run","sha":"2f188e34a3ac717df46021df5591e3b2580d96e2","user":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54749372,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDc0OTM3Mg==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"robertwb/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

sink support for setting Kafka message timestamps based on element timestamp. Otherwise there is no way for user to influence the timestamp of the messages in Kafka sink.\r\n\r\nThe implementation for for normal sink (`KafkaWriter.java`) is trivial: Just need to read the timestamp from the context. But EOS sink (`KafkaExactlyOnceWriter.java`) changes are a bit more involved. \r\n\r\nIn the case of the latter, the elements go through couple of shuffles and we need to include timestamp along with the the actual value. The implementation wraps timestamp and input KVs in `TimestampedValue<>`. This changes serialization of the elements shuffles. As a result EOS changes are not backward compatible (with upgrade or while using save points). I think the use of EOS sink is pretty minimal and this will have very little impact. I am not sure what the best practice is for handling such incompatibility in Beam. Ideally we want to error out early if a pipeline with exactly-once sink is being updated from version 2.3 to 2.4. PLMK. I can move timestamp support in EOS to Beam 3.0.\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-14T18:24:49Z","updated_at":"2018-03-22T17:56:50Z","closed_at":"2018-03-22T17:56:50Z","merged_at":"2018-03-22T17:56:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"501dc4cb17bb943aaa095feab959a9fed1aac20c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4868/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4868/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4868/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/cb594782de0bb0c36995eb4eb36f928273f6ffb4","head":{"label":"rangadi:sink_ts","ref":"sink_ts","sha":"cb594782de0bb0c36995eb4eb36f928273f6ffb4","user":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53447194,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzQ0NzE5NA==","name":"beam","full_name":"rangadi/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi/beam","description":"Mirror

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

IT for MongoDBIO. \r\n\r\nI suggested different Kubernetes scripts naming for mongo than for postgres scripts. The postgres' naming is quite confusing to me - the \"local\" scripts are used everywhere right now, not only while running tests locally, so why call them \"local\"?\r\n\r\nThere is another thing that bothers me: the node port service Kubernetes setup can be used only if the **whole** test (including `setup()` and `teardown()` methods) is run in the same network, as the k8 cluster is (to have direct access to pod IPs). This doesn't happen on Jenkins nor while running locally. This can happen if we are running sole pipeline without settingUp()/tearingDown() any connections but it's a rare situation for tests using databases. Also it works for Dataflow runner only.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should consider dropping the node port service from Kubernetes scripts and keep load balancer service only? Maybe there are some historical reasons I am not aware of?\r\n\r\n@chamikaramj @alanmyrvold could you take a look?\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-12T23:25:16Z","updated_at":"2018-03-20T19:12:27Z","closed_at":"2018-03-20T18:54:08Z","merged_at":"2018-03-20T18:54:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"fa53e60e73870ce25f08ab70114f0588133d5078","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4853/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4853/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4853/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/55b65c817118f85f85f3c86fc29ce7cf66145acc","head":{"label":"yifanzou:BEAM-3840/get-python-mobile-gaming-running-on-core-runners","ref":"BEAM-3840/get-python-mobile-gaming-running-on-core-runners","sha":"55b65c817118f85f85f3c86fc29ce7cf66145acc","user":{"login":"yifanzou","id":35050780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDUwNzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35050780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou","html_url":"https://github.com/yifanzou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":116185557,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTYxODU1NTc=","name":"beam","full_name":"yifanzou/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yifanzou","id":35050780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDUwNzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35050780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou","html_url":"https://github.com/yifanzou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yifanzou/beam","description":"Apache

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-12T22:37:16Z","updated_at":"2018-04-13T23:06:12Z","closed_at":"2018-04-13T23:06:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3c6a45d731ed83bfb2d04cd6ea1208929abfb040","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4852/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4852/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4852/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/90353af5d7e48b76523375cbd507c5b34ee62ae8","head":{"label":"huygaa11:pom-updates","ref":"pom-updates","sha":"90353af5d7e48b76523375cbd507c5b34ee62ae8","user":{"login":"huygaa11","id":4435399,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzUzOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4435399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11","html_url":"https://github.com/huygaa11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":112401010,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTI0MDEwMTA=","name":"beam","full_name":"huygaa11/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"huygaa11","id":4435399,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzUzOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4435399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11","html_url":"https://github.com/huygaa11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/huygaa11/beam","description":"Apache

\r\n\r\nThis is based on the python input reader but is not feature complete and needs more work. I am mostly opening this if anyone else would find it useful but also to provide feedback on the go sdk.\r\n\r\n1) Parallelism looks to be missing? Running this on Dataflow on an entity with 90 million items takes a long time (12+ hours). I've tried with 256, 512, and 1024 shards and the dataflow typically always runs with 4 workers no matter the shard size, I would have expected it to fan out and process at a much faster rate. Is this because of the compat runtime? Am I doing something wrong with my pipeline? Any insight would be great. I want to start using this for much larger size datasets, but the throughput isn't at a level that I could start using it.\r\n\r\n2) `beam.EncodeType` should not serialize the type and reconstruct on the other end. I can't think of a time that i would ever use this, losing the methods is a deal breaker, as well as not being able to handle complex structures. For example the `datastore.Key` has a recursive definition, and can't be put into this format. I might be missing something on this one but I am working on very little documentation(which is fine for now). The other example is that my struct implements `datastore.PropertyLoadSaver` which is lost when using `beam.EncodeType`. There doesn't seem to be an API to take advantage of `runtime.RegisterType` when using generics.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-12T14:55:40Z","updated_at":"2018-04-18T14:19:14Z","closed_at":"2018-04-18T14:19:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c4d239863af87ef2ddfbf9c9e7bfc31f787f95b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4850/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4850/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4850/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/c7690abdc1f93c2ba8be78c6ad76230b1d7eeea3","head":{"label":"bbassingthwaite:master","ref":"master","sha":"c7690abdc1f93c2ba8be78c6ad76230b1d7eeea3","user":{"login":"bbassingthwaite","id":1919080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTkwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1919080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbassingthwaite","html_url":"https://github.com/bbassingthwaite","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbassingthwaite/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbassingthwaite/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbassingthwaite/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbassingthwaite/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbassingthwaite/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbassingthwaite/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbassingthwaite/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbassingthwaite/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbassingthwaite/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"793bfac7516c2532ad4c979da220f2a9801e1b19","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50904245,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDkwNDI0NQ==","name":"beam","full_name":"apache/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam","description":"Apache

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

code generally only has access to the root pipeline and `AppliedPTransform`s while walking the pipeline to perform translation. This change adds a new `ExecutableStagePayload` message which is embedded in the `FunctionSpec` of serialized `ExecutableStage` `PTransform`s. Doing so avoids the extra pipeline munging necessary to access to proper set of subtransforms.\r\n\r\nIt also means that subtransforms are _not_ added directly to `ExecutableStage` transforms. This effectively makes executable stages native transforms, which they should be as far as the runner is concerned.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-08T22:01:55Z","updated_at":"2018-03-09T21:00:10Z","closed_at":"2018-03-09T20:56:31Z","merged_at":"2018-03-09T20:56:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"7605bcbffc83b6ac508f7bdc001f36de9bf8484b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4835/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4835/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4835/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/abae9f5fb050e57e506e5af68e9ced2c88af8fc9","head":{"label":"cclauss:unicode-to-six.text_type-again","ref":"unicode-to-six.text_type-again","sha":"abae9f5fb050e57e506e5af68e9ced2c88af8fc9","user":{"login":"cclauss","id":3709715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDk3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss","html_url":"https://github.com/cclauss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":102283701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDIyODM3MDE=","name":"beam","full_name":"cclauss/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cclauss","id":3709715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDk3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss","html_url":"https://github.com/cclauss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cclauss/beam","description":"Mirror

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-08T21:52:56Z","updated_at":"2018-03-13T20:39:14Z","closed_at":"2018-03-13T20:26:41Z","merged_at":"2018-03-13T20:26:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"c41521ab68ebfa6457ce5a4fbe89383e888e4e59","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4834/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4834/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4834/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/c0fcc6f1f8ba922d742e48731eadcd8c44a20e24","head":{"label":"cclauss:basestring-to-six.string_types-again","ref":"basestring-to-six.string_types-again","sha":"c0fcc6f1f8ba922d742e48731eadcd8c44a20e24","user":{"login":"cclauss","id":3709715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDk3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss","html_url":"https://github.com/cclauss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":102283701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDIyODM3MDE=","name":"beam","full_name":"cclauss/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cclauss","id":3709715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDk3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss","html_url":"https://github.com/cclauss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cclauss/beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

- [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [X] What the pull request does\r\n   - [X] Why it does it\r\n   - [X] How it does it\r\n   - [X] Why this approach\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-07T22:15:27Z","updated_at":"2018-03-09T17:23:12Z","closed_at":"2018-03-09T17:23:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0743c37ce48c3035c4953e49cdd2b22daf8489ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4823/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4823/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4823/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/fcc189087523fcea484eefe3ce9ddfe1fca6ac0b","head":{"label":"apilloud:nexmark-metrics","ref":"nexmark-metrics","sha":"fcc189087523fcea484eefe3ce9ddfe1fca6ac0b","user":{"login":"apilloud","id":5972627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzI2Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5972627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud","html_url":"https://github.com/apilloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119748403,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTk3NDg0MDM=","name":"beam","full_name":"apilloud/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apilloud","id":5972627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzI2Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5972627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud","html_url":"https://github.com/apilloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apilloud/beam","description":"Apache

easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-07T21:19:29Z","updated_at":"2018-03-11T22:47:34Z","closed_at":"2018-03-11T22:47:34Z","merged_at":"2018-03-11T22:47:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"8739d179738cc6f13bbc46450fea5260d84480d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4822/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4822/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4822/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/71315eaf79b0f090d748c6bfc815876042331c95","head":{"label":"akedin:sql-nested-row-support","ref":"sql-nested-row-support","sha":"71315eaf79b0f090d748c6bfc815876042331c95","user":{"login":"akedin","id":33067037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDY3MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33067037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin","html_url":"https://github.com/akedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108159679,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDgxNTk2Nzk=","name":"beam","full_name":"akedin/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"akedin","id":33067037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDY3MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33067037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin","html_url":"https://github.com/akedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/akedin/beam","description":"Mirror

easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-07T21:01:24Z","updated_at":"2018-03-08T00:03:41Z","closed_at":"2018-03-08T00:03:41Z","merged_at":"2018-03-08T00:03:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"d2aeb785da1d00b90e6195635b336f5b41cdb85c","assignee":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4821/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4821/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4821/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/384f5bfc3c59bc4733172ab9080047cb7fdf18a5","head":{"label":"tgroh:cherry_pick_4817","ref":"cherry_pick_4817","sha":"384f5bfc3c59bc4733172ab9080047cb7fdf18a5","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52644388,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NDM4OA==","name":"beam","full_name":"tgroh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh/beam","description":"Mirror

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-07T20:52:13Z","updated_at":"2018-07-04T12:02:45Z","closed_at":"2018-06-14T04:54:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"28287f60fe73d52a004bca648776033110ded2ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":974794430,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzQ3OTQ0MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4820/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4820/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4820/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/4e5e1bf23186917d02fba903df19f2410c72ed62","head":{"label":"cclauss:buffer-to-memoryview","ref":"buffer-to-memoryview","sha":"4e5e1bf23186917d02fba903df19f2410c72ed62","user":{"login":"cclauss","id":3709715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDk3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss","html_url":"https://github.com/cclauss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":102283701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDIyODM3MDE=","name":"beam","full_name":"cclauss/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cclauss","id":3709715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDk3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss","html_url":"https://github.com/cclauss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cclauss/beam","description":"Mirror

easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-07T03:46:09Z","updated_at":"2018-03-18T21:02:48Z","closed_at":"2018-03-18T21:02:48Z","merged_at":"2018-03-18T21:02:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"d8cb0e6098370dc5059834ea82c5f6fa22f6a91b","assignee":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4812/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4812/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4812/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/7e2dafd7d41d271959d1a0d2f732071e93c2a5b0","head":{"label":"alanmyrvold:alan-gradle","ref":"alan-gradle","sha":"7e2dafd7d41d271959d1a0d2f732071e93c2a5b0","user":{"login":"alanmyrvold","id":5553686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTM2ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5553686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold","html_url":"https://github.com/alanmyrvold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"cb13361a6d4452e7f5e31af5974e8b90316a654a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50904245,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDkwNDI0NQ==","name":"beam","full_name":"apache/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbj

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-05T02:45:31Z","updated_at":"2018-03-05T20:49:17Z","closed_at":"2018-03-05T20:49:17Z","merged_at":"2018-03-05T20:49:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"a629486f196b913bffe940fe7ac535ca77ca7ba9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4797/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4797/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4797/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/2448bc1666a6640ef9ce8a1eb1b8010c8003ee31","head":{"label":"youngoli:beam3126","ref":"beam3126","sha":"2448bc1666a6640ef9ce8a1eb1b8010c8003ee31","user":{"login":"youngoli","id":1740865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDA4NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1740865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli","html_url":"https://github.com/youngoli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":103320121,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDMzMjAxMjE=","name":"beam","full_name":"youngoli/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"youngoli","id":1740865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDA4NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1740865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli","html_url":"https://github.com/youngoli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/youngoli/beam","description":"Mirror
