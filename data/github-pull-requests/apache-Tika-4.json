<code>InetAddress</code>-<code>String</code> conversion methods to preserve the IPv6 scope ID if present. The scope ID can be necessary for IPv6-capable devices with multiple network interfaces. However, preserving it can also lead to problems for callers that rely on the returned values <em>not</em> to include the scope ID:\n<ul>\n<li>Callers might compensate for the old behavior of the methods by appending the scope ID to a returned string themselves. If so, you can update your code to stop doing so at the same time as you upgrade Guava. Of, if your code might run against multiple versions of Guava, you can check whether Guava has included a scope ID before you add one yourself.</li>\n<li>Callers might pass the returned string to another system that does not understand scope IDs. If so, you can strip the scope ID off, whether by truncating the string form at a <code>%</code> character (leaving behind any trailing <code>]</code> character in the case of <code>forUriString</code>) or by replacing the returned <code>InetAddress</code> with a new instance constructed by calling <code>InetAddress.getByAddress(addr)</code>.</li>\n<li><code>java.net.InetAddress</code> validates any provided scope ID against the interfaces available on the machine. As a result, methods in <code>InetAddresses</code> may now fail if the scope ID fails validation.\n<ul>\n<li>Notable cases in which this may happen include:\n<ul>\n<li>if the code runs in an Android app without networking permission</li>\n<li>if code passes <code>InetAddress</code> instances or strings across devices</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If this is not the behavior that you want, then you can strip off the scope ID from the input string before passing it to Guava, as discussed above.

traces) validation of\nconfig properties.\n-- Modify former InUseLock (now InternalUseLock) and NewProxyConnection\nto use ReentrantLock rather than native monitors, to prevent pinning\nwhen clients run on loom virtual threads.\nThanks Alex Kormukhin and Jeffrey Tucker!\n-- Implement config parameter markSessionBoundaries, so that users can\ndisable JDBC 4.3 beginRequest / endRequest session boundary marking\nwhen JDBC drivers so undesirable things with those hints.\nThanks Bikas Anand!\n-- Implement more careful examination of begin/endRequest methods, to take\ninto account the case where those methods exist on the JDBC driver Connection\nimplementation, but not in the Connection interface of a pre-Java-9 JVM.\nWe still support begin/endRequest in this case, but reflectively.\nThanks Vlad Skarzhevskyy, khushboo11-dotcom!\nc3p0-0.10.0\n-- A bit more testing\nc3p0-0.10.0-pre7\n-- Improve performance of begin/endRequest support\n-- Implement c3p0-loom UninstrumentedVirtualThreadPerTaskTaskRunnerFactory\n-- Change mind. Eliminate naggingly prescriptive equals/hashCode pseudorequirements\nfrom plugin interfaces, because our canonicalization strategy is by key, doesn' actually\nrely upon those implementations.\n-- Guard collection of MBeanAttributeInfo against items that would have no getter\nor setter to prevent ugly IntrospectionExceptions.\nSee <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/128\">swaldman/c3p0#128</a>\nThanks <a href=\"https://github.com/philippscs\"><code>@​philippscs</code></a>!\n-- Let C3P0PooledConnectionPool manager test introspected authentication that appears\nperhaps incomplete, and revert to NULL_AUTH (no-arg DataSource.getConnection()) if\nthe test fails.\nSee, should address, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/159\">swaldman/c3p0#159</a>\nThanks <a href=\"https://github.com/sbaeumlisberger\"><code>@​sbaeumlisberger</code></a>!\nc3p0-0.10.0-pre6\n-- Lots of documentation work.\n-- Implement attemptResurrectOnCheckin config parameter.\nSee <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/47\">swaldman/c3p0#47</a>\nThanks Bartosz Radaczyński and Igor Khromov!\n-- Add guard to automaticTestTable preventing use of weird or potentially malicious table names.\nThanks to Andy at Privitar\n-- Pick up com.mchange.v2.c3p0.impl.DefaultConnectionTester.isValidTimeout as default\nvalue of new connectionIsValidTimeout property, so that users upgrading from previous\nversion still capture the setting from the old config, even as their ConnectionTester\nnow falls back to null.\nc3p0-0.10.0-pre5\n-- Lots of documenting, condensing, clean-up, etc.\n-- Define connectionIsValidTimeout as an ordinary bean-style config parameter.\nPreviously users had to set a universal property (in c3p0.properties or System\nproperties) to set this timeout.\n-- Use simplified isValid(...) based timeout by default, use traditional</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/TIKA/issues/TIKA-4254\r\n\r\n### Brief Description of the Bug\r\n\r\nThe test `TestMimeTypes#testJavaRegex` is non-idempotent, as it passes in the first run but fails in the second run in the same environment. The source of the problem is that each test execution initializes a new media type (`MimeType`) instance `testType` (same problem for `testType2`), and all media types across different test executions attempt to use the same name pattern `\"rtg_sst_grb_0\\\\.5\\\\.\\\\d{8}\"`. Therefore, in the second execution of the test, the line `this.repo.addPattern(testType, pattern, true);` will throw an error, since the name pattern is already used by the `testType` instance initiated from the first test execution. Specifically, in the second run, the `addGlob()` method of the `Pattern` class will assert conflict patterns and throw a`MimeTypeException`(line 123 in `Patterns.java`).\r\n\r\n### Failure Message in the 2nd Test Run:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.tika.mime.MimeTypeException: Conflicting glob pattern: rtg_sst_grb_0\\.5\\.\\d{8}\r\n\tat org.apache.tika.mime.Patterns.addGlob(Patterns.java:123)\r\n\tat org.apache.tika.mime.Patterns.add(Patterns.java:71)\r\n\tat org.apache.tika.mime.MimeTypes.addPattern(MimeTypes.java:450)\r\n\tat org.apache.tika.mime.TestMimeTypes.testJavaRegex(TestMimeTypes.java:851)\r\n\tat java.base/java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:568)\r\n\tat java.base/java.util.ArrayList.forEach(ArrayList.java:1511)\r\n\tat java.base/java.util.ArrayList.forEach(ArrayList.java:1511)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reproduce\r\n\r\nUse the `NIOInspector` plugin that supports rerunning individual tests in the same environment:\r\n```\r\ncd tika-parsers/tika-parsers-standard/tika-parsers-standard-package\r\nmvn edu.illinois:NIOInspector:rerun -Dtest=org.apache.tika.mime.TestMimeTypes#testJavaRegex\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposed Fix\r\n\r\nDeclare `testType` and `testType2` as static variables and initialize them at class loading time. Therefore, repeated runs of `testJavaRegex()` will not conflict each other. All tests pass and are idempotent after the fix.\r\n\r\n### Necessity of Fix\r\n\r\nA fix is recommended as unit tests shall be idempotent, and state pollution shall be mitigated so that newly introduced tests do not fail in the future due to polluted shared

today's release, 33.2.0. These releases have begun adding Java 8+ APIs to <code>guava-android</code>. While we don't anticipate problems, we do anticipate that any unexpected problems could force a disruptive rollback. To minimize any disruption, we'd like to catch any such problems early.</p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=type%3Ddefect&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug_report.yaml\">let us know of any problems you encounter</a>.</p>\n<h3>Maven</h3>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.guava&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;guava&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;33.2.0-jre&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;!-- or, for Android: --&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;33.2.0-android&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Jar files</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/33.2.0-jre/guava-33.2.0-jre.jar\">33.2.0-jre.jar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/33.2.0-android/guava-33.2.0-android.jar\">33.2.0-android.jar</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Guava requires <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild#what-about-guavas-own-dependencies\">one runtime dependency</a>, which you can download here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/failureaccess/1.0.1/failureaccess-1.0.1.jar\">failureaccess-1.0.1.jar</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Javadoc</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/33.2.0-jre/api/docs/\">33.2.0-jre</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/33.2.0-android/api/docs/\">33.2.0-android</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>JDiff</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/33.2.0-jre/api/diffs/\">33.2.0-jre vs. 33.1.0-jre</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/33.2.0-android/api/diffs/\">33.2.0-android vs. 33.1.0-android</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/33.2.0-android/api/androiddiffs/\">33.2.0-android vs. 33.2.0-jre</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changelog</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Dropped testing for Android versions before Lollipop (API Level 21).

More <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6567\">Java 8 APIs</a> will follow in future releases.

(But note that we test only with library desugaring, so we don't <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/7197\">currently</a> know if API Level 24 is high enough to use our <code>Collector</code> APIs unless you have also enabled library desugaring.) Guava users who <em>avoid</em> the <code>Collector</code> APIs do <em>not</em> need to meet this requirement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Fixed a potential <code>NullPointerException</code> in <code>ImmutableMap.Builder</code> on a rare code path.
