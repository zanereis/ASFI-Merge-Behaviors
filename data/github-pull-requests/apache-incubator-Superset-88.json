SUMMARY\r\nA feature was recently introduced to automatically populate `query_context` in the chart metadata if it was missing. This was necessary to be able to render V1 chart reports, which require the frontend-rendered query request (not possible by the backend). However, if a non-owner triggered the chart update command, the original ownership data was lost due to the update payload not containing the `owners` property. This was due to the `self.populate_owners` method setting the owners to whichever value was passed in the request, which in this case was always `None`.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the chart update command to not modify the `owners` property when calling the chart update command with `query_context_generation`. In addition, an integration test is added to ensure that a non-owner can update the query context payload without changing the `owners` property (test fails on master). \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Start a fresh installation of Superset with a newly initiated metadata database and examples data populated\r\n2. Login as Admin\r\n2. Go to the Charts page and change one of the Examples chart owners from empty to \"Admin\"\r\n3. Open the chart into Explore view\r\n4. Go back to Charts page and check the chart owners - notice how the owners are empty again. Set the chart owner back to Admin.\r\n5. Reopen the chart in Explore, go to the Charts page and notice that now Admin is still an owner.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n[Shillelagh](https://github.com/betodealmeida/shillelagh/) is a library for querying APIs via SQL. It's currently used by Superset in order to connect to Google Sheets, but it offers more APIs:\r\n\r\n#### Datasette\r\n\r\n[Datasette](https://datasette.io/) is an open-source tool for exploring and publishing data, developed by one of the creators of Django. \"Datasettes\" are self-hosted micro web apps that serve a few tables, with a friendly UI. For example, [this list of trees in SF](https://san-francisco.datasettes.com/sf-trees/Street_Tree_List).\r\n\r\nShillelagh can query any Datasette table directly:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n% shillelagh\r\nsql> SELECT * FROM \"https://san-francisco.datasettes.com/sf-trees/Street_Tree_List\" LIMIT 5;\r\n  TreeID    qLegalStatus    qSpecies  qAddress             SiteOrder    qSiteInfo    PlantType    qCaretaker  qCareAssistant    PlantDate                 DBH  PlotSize    PermitNotes                XCoord       YCoord    Latitude    Longitude  Location\r\n--------  --------------  ----------  -----------------  -----------  -----------  -----------  ------------  ----------------  ----------------------  -----  ----------  --------------------  -----------  -----------  ----------  -----------  -------------------------------------\r\n  141565               1           1  501X Baker St                1            1            1             1                    07/21/1988 12:00:00 AM     21  Width 0ft   Permit Number 25401   6.00061e+06  2.11083e+06     37.776      -122.441  (37.7759676911831, -122.441396661871)\r\n  232565               2           2  940 Elizabeth St             1            2            1             1                    03/20/2017 12:00:00 AM      3  Width 4ft   Permit Number 779625  6.0004e+06   2.102e+06       37.7517     -122.441  (37.7517102172731, -122.441498017841)\r\n  119263               3           3  495X Lakeshore Dr            1            3            1             2                                                   10x30\r\n  207368               2           4  920 Kirkham St               1            1            1             1                                                6  Width 1ft                         5.99201e+06  2.10527e+06     37.7602     -122.471  (37.760210314285, -122.47073935813)\r\n  188702               3           5  1501 Evans Ave               2            4            1             2                                               17  Width 4ft                         6.01599e+06  2.09822e+06     37.7422     -122.387  (37.7422086702947, -122.387293152263)\r\nsql>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can create a dataset in Superset and make a map of red maple trees in SF:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-08-23 at 21-12-41  DEV  Red maple trees in SF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/130554644-8e1549b3-5660-4664-a228-c3999ece7d78.png)\r\n\r\n#### Socrata\r\n\r\nThe [Socrata Open Data API](https://dev.socrata.com/) is a simple API used by many governments, non-profits, and NGOs around the world, including the CDC. Shillelagh can connect directly to any Socrata dataset by using its API URL.

It requires signing up and an API key, but there's a free account.\r\n\r\nHere's an example chart showing the perceived temperature in Fahrenheit in Bodega Bay:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n% shillelagh\r\nsql> SELECT AVG(feelslike_f) AS \"AVG(feelslike_f)\"\r\nFROM \"https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/history.json?q=94923\"\r\nLIMIT 10000\r\nOFFSET 0;\r\n  AVG(feelslike_f)\r\n------------------\r\n           57.6054\r\nsql>\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-08-24 at 08-40-19  DEV  Explore - https api weatherapi com v1 history json q=94923](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/130647161-a167fc13-465d-4bbf-aaf4-ca3948bfadbe.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nShillelagh supports two dialects, `shillelagh://` and `shillelagh+safe://`. The former is disabled in Superset if `PREVENT_UNSAFE_DB_CONNECTIONS` is true, since it can read and write to disk. The latter allows only safe adapters to be loaded, and they have to be listed explicitly:\r\n\r\n<img

SUMMARY\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/16200 updated the add chart page and as a side effect started showing virtual datasets in the dropdown.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCurrently the NA values used in `superset/config.py` are imported via `from pandas.io.parsers import STR_NA_VALUES`. In `pandas>=1.3.0` this approach breaks due to some refactoring in pandas and leads to the following exception: \r\n\r\n`ImportError: cannot import name 'STR_NA_VALUES' from 'pandas.io.parsers'`\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the import is refactored to use `from pandas._libs.parsers import STR_NA_VALUES`, which imports the same NA values as before but uses the original pandas module. This refactoring should work with both the current `pandas==1.2.5` dependency, as well as more recent versions e.g. `pandas==1.3.0`. \r\n\r\nFinally, since this import uses a Cython extension, the corresponding pylint tox environment was modified with the `--extension-pkg-allow-list` option to avoid a false positive when running pylint. \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nUpgrading the pandas package that superset uses to `pandas>=3.0` and starting up superset should reproduce the `ImportError` caused by the dependency issue.

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhile reviewing/testing #16144 , I came across a TODO related to the `/related` endpoints not returning total object count, but rather the count of results on the requested page. \r\n\r\nThis PR makes the following changes:\r\n- When `include_ids` is undefined, always return the total number of objects as the `count` parameter as opposed to the actual number of objects in `result`.\r\n- When `include_ids` is defined, behavior is unchanged, i.e. `count` equals the length of `result`.\r\n- When `include_ids` is defined and `page > 0`, a 400 is returned due to pagination of mixed results not being possible.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nCurrently the `count` parameter in the response is equal to the length of the `result` array (in this example, the total number of objects is in fact two, not just one):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130430642-68136936-76da-4a47-ada2-854dcbf34cf3.png)\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the `count` parameter shows the total number of objects, despite the page size being less:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130430128-c6efd9c4-862a-432a-97e4-2086992b46ab.png)\r\n\r\nWhen sending the request with `include_ids` and `page=0`, the result is the same as before (notice how `page_size` only affects the values not included in `include_ids`):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130431296-34112eaf-f5ff-41b8-afb3-fd66237dbc1f.png)\r\n\r\nNow requesting other than the first page with defined `include_ids` will result in a 400:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130430204-7b9c2cf8-f683-4f03-b375-647a991e980d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR introduces four new options to the Modal component\r\n\r\n`resizable`: It makes the Modal resizable using re-resizable\r\n`resizableConfig`: It accepts a re-resizable configuration object\r\n`draggable`: It makes the Modal draggable using react-draggable\r\n`resizableConfig`: It accepts a react-draggable configuration object\r\n\r\nThe `resizable` and `draggable` are completely independent of each other, they can be used in combination or not used at all.\r\n\r\n_Note: When `resizable` or/and `draggable` are used, the Modal mask will be disabled._\r\n\r\n_Note: When `resizable` and `draggable` are **not** used, the original Modal node will be returned. This is to minimize the impact of these changes on existing Modals._\r\n\r\n### SHOULD I USE THESE OPTIONS?\r\n\r\nThis is up for debate. Personally, I believe resizable and draggable Modals can be useful in very specific cases but should never be used heavily. A better UX solution should be found when the need of resizable and draggable Modals increases. \r\n\r\n### FIRST EXAMPLE: VIEW QUERY MODAL\r\n\r\nBoth `resizable` and `draggable` options have been enabled for the \"View Query\" Modal. The Modal has been slightly enhanced in order for the `SyntaxHighlighter` Component to take the full height. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1680\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-08-22 at 23 16 11\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/130369026-e0bb113b-266d-4b62-91e4-dfaaecca146b.png\">\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/130369005-45e1e8a5-a90f-4d6c-9814-48918b49ffdd.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open Explore\r\n2. Click on \"View Query\"\r\n3. Hover the title and drag the Modal in the window\r\n4. Hover and drag the right, right bottom, and bottom corners to resize the modal\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

SUMMARY\r\n- Change the list views to use the new Select component\r\n- Adjusts the design of the date range picker to match other controls\r\n- Aligns the sort select with the other controls\r\n- Makes the layout behavior consistent when resizing the screen\r\n- Adjusts the controls to have the same width\r\n- Previously we had 'Me' and 'Admin', which are the same user, now it will only show the name of the logged user always as the first option of the select.\r\n- Adjusts the tests\r\n\r\n@junlincc @jinghua-qa @rusackas @mistercrunch \r\n\r\nPS: Sorry for the big PR, but everything needs

SUMMARY\r\n1:dashboard-ui:\r\nI think it related to [PR #13037](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/13037), which help add 8px marginRight when there are more than one element.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nEnabling one of my all time favorite Pylint checks‚Äî`useless-suppression`. I'm not sure why it's not enabled by default, but it's a great check to ensure the code base includes no unnecessary `#pylint: disable=<check>` clutter due either to human error or evolving Pylint logic. \r\n\r\nThe one major caveat is there's a false positive with the `line-too-long` check (https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/4212) which we need to disable on a per line basis.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\n- Preset needs to add some custom sequential color palettes for specific users\r\n- color palettes are delivered in bootstrap data, via the `extra_sequential_color_schemes` and `extra_categorical_color_schemes` fields.\r\n- Wanted to allow general changes to common bootstrap data as well, to allow open-ended support for customizations in Superset deployments.\r\n- Decided to add a function which can be configured to get these `bootstrap_data.common` overrides.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Set `EXTRA_SEQUENTIAL_COLOR_SCHEMES` to a function that returns a dict of `{ \"foo\": \"bar\" }`\r\n2. Verify that Superset Frontend still renders, and that `{ \"foo\": \"bar\" }` was delivered in the bootstrap data.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [x] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

SUMMARY\r\nA recent PR #16193 replaced the external metadata endpoint from using path based parameters to using a rison encoded object.

SUMMARY\r\nAdds `extraVolumes` and `extraVolumeMounts` objects to the Helm chart. Any volumes specified will be mounted to the main containers of all deployments as well as the init-job. Use cases include mounting additional Python modules (so they don't have to be written in-line as a YAML string) and passing in CA certs that are required by our stack.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n- Add one or more `extraVolumes` and `extraVolumeMounts`.\r\n- Run `helm install --dry-run` and confirm that the pod specs contain the new volumes\r\n- Example:\r\n```yaml\r\nextraVolumes:\r\n  volume1:\r\n    configMap:\r\n      name: '{{ template \"superset.fullname\" . }}-custom-config'\r\n  volume2:\r\n    secret:\r\n      secretName: my-secret\r\nextraVolumeMounts:\r\n  volume1:\r\n    mountPath: /mnt/volume1\r\n  volume2:\r\n    mountPath: /mnt/volume2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe `get_chart_dataframe` method was not building a correct dataframe when the column/index were not

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR replaces the document title back to the original one when leaving the dashboard. This is to make sure that the dashboard title does not remain in the browser tab while moving to different pages without reloading.\r\n\r\nThis is not a definitive solution but a quick fix for the problem reported in #16254. As we move toward eliminating page reloads, the need for a title management implementation arises. In fact, the titles are currently only managed server-side, with the Dashboard page being the only exception.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/129903630-e99f92f6-733b-4566-82a9-b7f9ff09a715.mp4\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/129903675-df40022d-e4d8-443a-82cf-8e198e1eb8f1.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Go to the Dashboards' list\r\n2. Open a Dashboard and observe the browser tab title\r\n3. Go back to the Dashboards' list and make sure the browser tab title has changed\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user added 3 or more columns to a control that accepts only columns (such as Group by) and started reordering using drag and drop, the feature was starting to glitch after the first sorting.\r\nThe first dragging and dropping a column to reorder worked correctly. Due to memoization, when user wanted to reorder the second time, the drop index from the first reordering was being used as a start index of the next reordering. That caused a glitch, which resulted in columns \"jumping\" and changing their positions incorrectly.\r\n\r\nAnother issue related to reordering with dnd happened in filters and metrics controls. After reordering, when user clicked a metric label, the popover's content was stale - it showed the column name and aggregate of a metric that was at current index before reordering. The source of the problem seems to be antd popover's internal memoization, which we can switch off by setting a prop `destroyTooltipOnHide`. Before, that prop was set only for popover used to create a new metric or filter, so that user doesn't see old selections after creating a metric/filter and clicking again. Now we set that prop also for popovers used for editing metrics and filters.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: see linked issue\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/129889010-9e5c5a1e-28f7-41e2-a3b0-46bf6d446b86.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0. Enable dnd feature flag\r\n1. Open a chart and add 3 or more columns\r\n2.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCurrently the time grain only applies to the main temporal column, making it impossible to have multiple time grained groupbys in the same chart. This PR changes the SqlAlchemy model to apply the time grain to all selected temporal columns. By applying this change it will no longer be possible to mix time grains and original values from two different temporal columns. However, it is unlikely that anyone would prefer that behavior over the proposed new flow, given that in the old flow it was impossible to apply a time grain to other than the main temporal column. \r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nTable chart:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/129858123-b2cb3994-0574-4dfe-97da-3b4d3a47376c.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/129858167-ee217dcd-885a-46af-af39-8d105f8d8623.png)\r\n\r\nPivot table v2:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/129858314-6981a0e0-a79c-482c-947e-5a65b9f20f70.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/129858345-f903fe79-463f-407a-bee6-937f1fcb3f82.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nTable chart:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/129858421-936899c4-ae74-4256-81cc-8cb0adeeb3fb.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/129858906-17fb7859-6367-4f69-9504-b5da32396ca4.png)\r\n\r\nPivot table v2:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/129858626-21e6eea7-ed34-4a1b-a2a3-63dc68cb6cdf.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/129858861-d21e5341-973c-444e-8640-529d0a844dcb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis fixes this issue: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/16149\r\n\r\nThe reason for this issue occurring is that Javascript orders objects based on integer and integer-like keys first, and then all strings: https://2ality.com/2015/10/property-traversal-order-es6.html\r\n\r\nTherefore to prep the data for copyToClipboard, this code goes through and orders the keys based on the column names. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nAlso fixed the table order, which was previously wrong. \r\nBefore: \r\n![Screen Shot 2021-08-20 at 10 20 21

mix of integers and strings as columns\r\n2) run a query on the database\r\n3) Use the copy to clipboard feature. \r\n4) Go into explore, use the copy to clipboard feature. \r\n\r\nAlso-\r\n1) Go to charts\r\n2) make sure the different visualization types have the south data pane rendering \r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\nFixes Issue #14520 \r\n\r\nextraConfigs do not work for adding databases. This fixes that problem by adjusting the name of the yaml-file to-be-created \r\n (configured in extraConfigs)  to match the filename mentioned by the initscript.\r\n\r\nThis PR alligns them so that they are referencing the same name: **import_datasources.yaml**.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nTested using Kind 0.11.1\r\n\r\nAdd these lines in the values.yaml file.\r\nThe configuration might fail if the trino database does not exist. Which means that the configuration value is actually read and processed.\r\n\r\n```\r\nextraConfigs:\r\n  import_datasources.yaml: |\r\n    databases:\r\n    - allow_csv_upload: true\r\n

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently Explore doesn't let Admins overwrite a slice if they don't belong to the owners group. This changes this so that admins have the `can_overwrite` property on bootstrap data set to `True` if the user is an owner OR they are an Admin. In addition, the Edit Chart metadata modal is changed so that it is possible to save even if the owner list is empty. This is to align the behavior of the Chart metadata modal with the Dashboard metadata modal. See #15149 for more context on this change.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nAs an admin, the user can now overwrite the chart if they are an Admin:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/129674266-71e0ef88-e649-4ac5-99ce-5aed695d433b.png)\r\nIn addition, the Chart metadata modal is now saveable even if the owners list is empty:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/129674320-8d967421-0f8e-4b8c-92f5-14e0f6e6dd91.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nCurrently the overwrite option is disabled for admins that aren't set as owners of a chart:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/129674430-29976a79-01ea-4b09-83ad-48cd65579f15.png)\r\nIn addition, the Save button in the Chart metadata modal is disabled when empty:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/129674552-b15a5dc9-c0ed-405a-a26f-d0605bf724b2.png)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes many cases when applying the pivot table post-processing.\r\n\r\nI reimplemented the algorithm from scratch to make sure it matches the JS logic, testing as many combinations as I could and comparing the Python results with the JS visualization.\r\n\r\nFor each of those cases I added a unit test showing the pivot. The resulting table in each of the unit tests matches the table from the visualization.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

perf improvement is hard to estimate, because I only run a few times, with same dashboard, from my own computer. I feel it might be highly impacted by my computer's performance. For example if i was in zoom meeting the page load will be slower :joy: \r\nSince the change is relatively small, I hope could deploy to airbnb production environment and collect some real data. If thing didn't work well, i am ok to roll it back. \r\n\r\ncc @nytai and @suddjian I saw you have a lot of work on spa and recent dashboard refactor, please take a look at this PR.\r\n\r\nalso cc

SUMMARY\r\nAs explained in #16209, original Flask context is not present on the Celery workers. Because of that, some crucial information like granular source or access token are not reachable for establishing a proper DB connection. This PR ads two functions to the config allowing to materialize some global Flask properties into the Celery request on the requestor side and then dematerialize them back into the global environment on the Celery worker side, thus allowing DB_CONNECTION_MUTATOR to always have all required information.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Define some simple metadata passover functions (e.g. `CELERY_FLASK_METADATA_EXTRACTOR` getting some field from `flask.request` and `CELERY_FLASK_METADATA_INITIALIZER` putting this data somewhere in `flask.g`)\r\n2. Run a query from the Superset SQL Lab locally with a breakpoint on the Celery worker side.\r\n3. Check `flask.g` contains an expected parameter.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: Implements #16209\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the time filter indicator shows filter box time filters as being applied despite being set to \"No filter\". This PR changes the chart data endpoint (both legacy and VI) to not add the time filter to \"applied columns\" if the time filter is set to \"No filter\". In addition, unit tests are added for all non-Druid functionality in `get_time_filter_status` as the function didn't have any unit tests, along with a dataset fixture that can be used with the new unit tests (=faster than the integration tests).\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNotice how now the indicator doesn't show the filter box time range as being applied when set to \"No filter\":\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/129561408-a24c5820-cc65-4be8-8122-5c34927aae95.png)\r\nHowever, when set to something else, it's now showing up correctly:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/129562533-9a44ec1a-b828-4955-80cb-3c022f783671.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nNotice how both V1 (left) and legacy (middle) chart indicators previously showed the filter as being applied: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/129561310-7db74cb6-ff5b-470d-ab75-7a3bab40be11.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a filter box with a \"No filter\" time range and create a dashboard with it\r\n2. Add a legacy chart to the dashboard\r\n3.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nRe-enabling the Pylint `raise-missing-from` check.\r\n\r\nNote one thing which was somewhat concerning whilst updating the code was a common theme of repeated code logic, i.e., there are multiple [`validate_json`](https://github.com/apache/superset/search?q=%22def+validate_json%22) method with identical (or near identical logic). Thankfully there is a `duplicate-code` Pylint check (currently disabled) which can prevent this from occurring in the future, however I sense there needs to be a collective effort to rectify the issue in the current code.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen building a CSV report for an old chart, the worker needs to fetch a screenshot of the chart in order to populate the `query_context` column of the chart. This is needed to request CSV data for the chart if it hasn't been saved with its `query_context`.\r\n\r\nOne problem in doing this is that the worker generating the report might not own the chart, so they are unable to populate `query_context`. I added a check to bypass the permission check only when the request is just for `query_object`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-08-13 at 08-25-47 Superset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/129382243-a0cc59b6-c296-4bcd-a09d-f3333b7dd525.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-08-13 at 08-25-27  Report  Test 2 Most Populated Countries - ralmeida gmail com - Gmail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/129382248-1c809c00-b839-47f9-9cc5-ccc95b59e3d6.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Create a CSV report of a chart from the examples **that hasn't been opened yet** (so that `query_context` is null).\r\n2. Configure screenshots with a low-level user that doesn't own the chart (ie, not \"admin\").\r\n3. Reports should work fine.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has
