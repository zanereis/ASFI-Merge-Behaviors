creates a new dependency between `DataflowRunner` and `PortableRunner`. `DataflowRunner` uses `DockerEnvironment` but there was no need for `DataflowRunner` to depend on the `PortableRunner` module before. We will refactor out `default_docker_image()` method to live in `apache_beam.transforms.Environment`.\r\n\r\nJIRA issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8666\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

sure when this start happening. The problem is that Jenkins runs `gradle :runBeamDependencyCheck`. When the Gradle runs tasks with colons (aka. qualified names), then the path is resolved relative to the root project. In our case, it only checks dependencies defined in the root directory. Removing the \":\" from the task name will lead to a multi-project build.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

changes to the FnApiRunner prepare it to work on the streaming case. Changes, in general are:\r\n\r\n- Execution now is driven by executing available early work.\r\n  - Before this change, execution was driven by fully executing each stage one by one.\r\n- There is a primitive watermark manager that tracks the advancement of the watermark across the pipeline.\r\n\r\nNext steps:\r\n- Support for TestStream, to enable streaming-based testing of the FnApiRunner.\r\n- Creating a first streaming source.\r\n\r\n**Worth noting:**\r\n- Note that commit https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/10067/commits/e9345afbae1e2219a199ef01c683d05e3d6fe207 changes the behavior of a particular corner case.\r\n- Remaining flaky test: `FnApiRunnerSplitTestWithMultiWorkers.test_split_crazy_sdf`\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

extends the Docker environment to support passing a JSON configuration string, similar to the Process and External environments, in order to facilitate the passing of environment variables to the docker runtime. As part of this change, the `DockerPayload` grows a new `env` map field.\r\n\r\nIf a JSON configuration string is used to construct a Docker environment, it must include a `docker_image` key, and can optionally include an `env` sub-object representing an environment variable map. These variables will be forwarded to the `docker` command via `--env` flags.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Implemented cache eviction whenever Python interpreter exits.\r\n2. Cache for PCollections is grouped by PCollections as the\r\nInteractive Beam user flow is now data-centric. And cache including\r\nits eviction is  managed by a global interactive environment instance\r\ncreated/retrieved/reset implicitly by runners in the same main\r\nthread/loop.\r\n3. Unified Python version requirement to 3.6 for interactive features\r\nand their tests for simplicity. We don't have test suite between py35\r\nand py36 (both exclusive) anyway, so there is no need to check by\r\n3.5.3 when some mock test features are only available in 3.6 and later.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`OnCreateMatcher` actually turned out to be pretty involved because we have several matchers that are intended to be used in this context and match against `PipelineResult`, even though they're actually checking something else, like file or BQ table contents. Rather than plumbing through the `PipelineResult` just so I could pass one to these matchers to make them happy, I refactored them so that they can actually be used fluently, like \r\n```java\r\nassertThat(expectedOutputFiles, containsWordCounts(expectedWordCounts));\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```java\r\nassertThat(\r\n    new NumberedShardedFile(options.getOutput() + \"*-of-*\"),\r\n    fileContentsHaveChecksum(DEFAULT_OUTPUT_CHECKSUM));\r\n```\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Deprecate, don't remove\r\n- [ ] Remove usages of `setTempRoot` and deprecate (maybe in a separate PR)\r\n- [ ] Remove

PR adds a cross-language `SqlTransform` stub to the python SDK. For expansion, it relies on a new SQL-only expansion service (`:sdks:java:extensions:sql:expansion-service`) added to Java. It also adds a `wordcount_xlang_sql` example script, and a suite of tests, `sql_test.py`, which can be run continuously with the new `:validatesCrossLanguageRunnerPythonUsingSql` gradle target.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK | Apex | Dataflow |

in nearby code and fixed TestStream's coder, which was set to the class and not an instance of the class (it looks like no other code is actually using this coder, so that's why it wasn't detected).\r\n\r\nR: @lukecwik\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Use pyproject.toml to install requirements for building beam\r\n  - Consolidate a bunch of requirements that were spread across gen_protos, gradle, and tox\r\n  - Remove the convoluted process in gen_protos where it tries to install deps, they're covered by pyproject.toml now\r\n- Use tox to build sdist of beam instead of gradle:  one less virtualenv and fewer deps installed for no reason\r\n- Remove test_requires because they're already handled by extras\r\n- Don't call python setup.py nosetests because it rebuilds beam:  we want this to be entirely controlled by our tox (our pep517-build system)\r\n- Stop running tests against code in the source directory!  This undermines the sandboxing that tox provides and requires more work from gradle and tox cleanup scripts to try to resolve.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note here is that despite the progress made by peps 517 and 518 toward improving the python build toolchains, it's still not a turnkey solution.  You can't just `pip build sdist` yet.  I tried a dozen different things, but it looks like the best solution is this [pep517](https://pypi.org/project/pep517/) module.  References:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6041\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58753970/how-to-build-a-source-distribution-without-using-setup-py-file\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that we're always building cython on linux, rather than doing it conditionally based on the test we're running.  Need to figure out if we can control that with environment markers\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
