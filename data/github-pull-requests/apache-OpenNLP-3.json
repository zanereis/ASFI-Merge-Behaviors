reduces code duplication in `PerceptronModelWriter`, `GISModelWriter`, and `NaiveBayesModelWriter` by introducing AbstractMLModelWriter\r\n- simplifies related, existing test classes by using `ParameterizedTest` now\r\n- optimizes PrepAttachDataUtil to cache already read ppa files avoiding IO efforts during execution of the whole OpenNLP tools test suite\r\n- reduces test execution times by ~5-10 %\r\n- adjusts 'forbiddenapis' plugin's bundledSignature to more precisely cover `jdk-deprecated-${java.version}` (for now: 11 !) which was by default 1.7

you for contributing to Apache OpenNLP.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with OPENNLP-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically main)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn clean install at the root opennlp folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file in opennlp folder?\r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the NOTICE file, including the main NOTICE file found in opennlp folder?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\n\r\nThis PR is the first sub-task of [OPENNLP-1447](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENNLP-1447).\r\n\r\n- It introduces `slf4j-api` in OpenNLP and replaces calls to `System.err` or `System.out` by related logger calls.\r\n- It adds `log4j2` as `runtime` dependency to the OpenNLP distribution + related configuration and adjusts the scripts accordingly\r\n\r\n#### Notes for reviewers:\r\n\r\n- Revision of log levels is tracked with [OPENNLP-1449](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENNLP-1449) and is not scope of the given PR. However, comments on specific log levels are highly welcome, so they can be tracked and incorporated in OPENNLP-1449.\r\n- Fully use of formatting using the possibilities of SLF4J eg.`{}`-replacement is tracked with [OPENNLP-1450](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENNLP-1450) and is not scope of the given PR.\r\n- Log output reduction during the build is currently tracked with  [OPENNLP-1451](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENNLP-1451). At the moment, I introduced `slf4j-simple` as a `test` dependency and disabled log output. We can discuss how we want to deal with it within OPENNLP-1451.\r\n- If some removed `System.out / System.err` statements (in the tests) are really needed, please leave a comment. We can easily move them to log statements\r\n\r\n#### TODOs for reviewers:\r\n\r\n- It would be great, if our heavy CLI users like @atarora can provide valuable feedback.\r\n- Due to the absence of a Windows machine, I cannot test the `.bat` changes - maybe some Windows user can have a look here.\r\n- It would be great, if someone with the `eval` datasets available on his/her machine can run the `eval` tests and provide feedback, if needed.\r\n- I disabled a few tests, which relied on overriding `System.out` and gathering the output. Happy to receive ideas on how we can re-write them to work with `slf4j-simple` in the test context\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13417392/213663341-0e8a76fa-188b-4137-90e5-4c3f9427a303.png)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-20T09:35:12Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T21:57:54Z","closed_at":"2023-02-28T07:33:39Z","merged_at":"2023-02-28T07:33:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"884a65e05744f4deed8a32f9b7e4da2ad7db5e76","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1651647887,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjUxNjQ3ODg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/labels/dependencies","name":"dependencies","color":"0366d6","default":false,"description":"Pull

you for contributing to Apache OpenNLP.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with OPENNLP-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically main)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn clean install at the root opennlp folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file in opennlp folder?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the NOTICE file, including the main NOTICE file found in opennlp folder?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\n\r\n- Don't run publish snapshots on forked repositories (as they do not have the secrets available and will fail as reported by @mawiesne

adds specific `equals` and `hashCode` implementations for `TokenizerModel` and  `ParserModel`.\r\n- introduces new test dependency `junit-jupiter-params` (test-scoped) to _opennlp-tools_ for more flexible test setups.\r\n- improves `TokenizerModelTest`, `treeinsert.ParserTest` and `chunking.ParserTest` by adding further assertions and fixes TODOs.\r\n- adds `AbstractParserModelTest` to avoid code duplication, simplifying existing test cases.\r\n- adds another `Parse` example to demonstrate how easy it is to check different examples without duplicating code.\r\n- removes uncommented code from both `ParserTest` variants (chunker/treeinsert) by providing actual assertions instead!\r\n\r\nTasks\r\n-\r\nThank you for contributing to Apache OpenNLP.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review
