setup and teardown functions.\r\n\r\nThis commit removes the explicit setup and teardown functions in favor of the\r\nautomatic pytest version, and thereby also ensures that the seed handling code\r\nis not executed twice. As a side benefit, seed handling now works correctly even\r\nif contributors forget to add the magic setup_module and teardown_module\r\nimports in new test files.\r\n\r\nIf pytest is run with

versions of MXNet website artifacts are compressed into a zip file and stored in a private S3 bucket, with the following file structure:\r\n> version\r\n> ----1.0.0\r\n> ----1.1.0\r\n>...\r\n> ----1.6.0\r\n> ----1.7.0\r\n\r\nFor new MXNet versions released, we need to add the new website artifacts into the above zip file and upload it to the S3 bucket. Currently we have a pipeline that generates version specific artifacts, but it's still a manual process to upload them to s3 in the expected format shown above. \r\nThis PR aims to automate the website artifact uploading process.\r\nWe introduced pipeline `Jenkinsfile_website_upload` to build the new version website artifacts, prepare all versions of website artifacts into the expected format, and upload them to the target S3 bucket. This pipeline utilizes Jenkins environment variable `FOLDER_NAME` to specify the name of the new artifacts to be

to the above link. There are four stages in the website pipeline: build, build docs, prepare, and publish.\r\n\r\nIn the prepare stage we need to check if the docs artifacts are successfully fetched (from the s3 bucket) for the mxnet version we are defaulting to before moving on to publish the website. This is critical because if the artifacts are missing then the website will be unavailable. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we want to extract the website redirect information (default mxnet version) here https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/179262b1e357f3ed7bd2825a5a16259b45a2c40f/docs/static_site/src/.htaccess#L30, and check if in our docker there is already the folder `/versions/{version}/api`.\r\n\r\nThe added commands will 1. check if `.htaccess` exists (return 1 if so) 2. match the version number 3. check if there are multiple version numbers (return 1 if so) 4. check if the version is empty (return 1 if so) 5. check if the directory exists (return 1 if NOT so)\r\n\r\nwe use `sed -nre 's/^[^0-9]*(([0-9]+\\.)*[0-9]+).*/\\1/p')` to match the version number. Example:\r\ninput\r\n```\r\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ /versions/1.7/$1 [r=307,L]\r\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ /versions/2.0/$1 [r=307,L]\r\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ /versions/2.1/$1 [r=307,L]\r\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ /versions/1.8/$1 [r=307,L]\r\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ /versions/0.0.0/$1 [r=307,L]\r\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ /versions/2.1.12321/$1 [r=307,L]\r\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ /versions/1.a/$1 [r=307,L]\r\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ /versions/a.b/$1 [r=307,L]\r\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ /versions/a.1.b/$1 [r=307,L]\r\n```\r\noutput \r\n```\r\n1.7\r\n2.0\r\n2.1\r\n1.8\r\n0.0.0\r\n2.1.12321\r\n1\r\n```\r\nOf course in reality there must only be one and only one match.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\nwe need to test if `exit 1` will stop/fail the pipeline. If not we probably need to catch the return val in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/1f158197aa1fbd3a31c67581537bc1ee37e11dd0/ci/jenkins/Jenkins_steps.groovy#L1096 and find command to stop the pipeline there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@mseth10 @ys2843  @waytrue17

Description ##\r\nThis is a twin of #19201 to fix #19197.  I made a flaky test, sorry.  \r\n\r\nIt's testing a quantizer that entails rounding but rounding 0.5 is ambiguous.  So I intended to ban 0.5 by adding a small value.  The code checks the interval (0.45, 0.55) and adds 0.05 to anything there.  But that just shifts it to (0.5, 0.6) when I meant to go further from 0.5.  Now it shifts to (0.65, 0.75) so 0.5 won't appear.  \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nFix flaky test `test_contrib_intgemm_prepare_data`\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nAnother approach would be to allow some tolerance for quantized values around 0.5.

Description ##\r\nThis is testing a quantizer by comparing with other MXNet operators like round.  There's one ambiguous case, which is what to do with 0.5, 1.5, -0.5, etc.  Implementations can disagree (plus floating point rounding might push things to the side a bit) and that's ok.  So to make things consistent, I pushed random values between (0.45 and 0.55) away from 0.5 by adding. . . 0.05.  That was dumb because it just mapped values in (0.45, 0.55) to (0.5, 0.6) which still had the same rounding issue and triggered a flaky test #19197.  This PR remaps (0.45, 0.55) to (0.65, 0.75) ensuring no value is near 0.5 when it is rounded.  Then quantized values can be compared exactly.  \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Fix flaky test\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThere will be another PR for master.

supports a number of optimizations to reduce the size of debug information in the binary. They work based on the assumption that the debug type information can be spread out over multiple compilation units. For instance, Clang will not emit type definitions for types that are not needed by a module and could be replaced with a forward declaration. Further, Clang will only emit type info for a dynamic C++ class in the module that contains the vtable for the class.\r\n\r\nThe -fstandalone-debug option turns off these optimizations. This is useful when working with 3rd-party libraries that don’t come with debug information. Note that Clang will never emit type information for types that are not referenced at all by the program.\"\r\n\r\nWithout -fstandalone-debug, lldb usage is degraded as debug information of C++ standard library types such strings or containers will be unusable and the types cannot be printed in lldb. Thus set the option by default in clang builds to assist developers unfamiliar with clang / lldb intricacies.","created_at":"2020-09-18T17:59:10Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T19:24:34Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"717b005fa42451a50c375645c966e1e55fd2313d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NzQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-testing","name":"pr-awaiting-testing","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"PR

the 1.x backporting of master-branch PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/19123 (as PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/19158), some issues were discovered and corrected.  This PR \"forward ports\" the result so that the logic behind use of fatbin compression remains consistent between master and v1.x.\r\n\r\nCurrently, master has the following issues:\r\n\r\nIf CMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS were already set, to say \"--foo=bar\", then that env var would be altered incorrectly to \"--foo=bar--fatbin-options -compress-all\"\r\n\r\nAlso, if USE_SPLIT_ARCH_DLL=OFF and MSVC=1, there would be no fatbin compression, even with USE_FATBIN_COMPRESSION=ON.\r\n\r\nThis PR corrects these issues, and so makes master behave like v1.x.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-18T01:27:54Z","updated_at":"2020-09-22T16:23:36Z","closed_at":"2020-09-22T16:23:35Z","merged_at":"2020-09-22T16:23:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"42ef1cbd0e651b6aac15039e348ef0e5b94685b6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/19175/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/19175/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/19175/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/5346595243c8709a03164e53eedc9bcdf48d461c","head":{"label":"DickJC123:forwardport_fatbin_compression","ref":"forwardport_fatbin_compression","sha":"5346595243c8709a03164e53eedc9bcdf48d461c","user":{"login":"DickJC123","id":1703397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123","html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86116214,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjExNjIxNA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"DickJC123/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DickJC123","id":1703397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123","html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

pr forces static link to libopenblas.a on all pipelines to avoid the name clashing issue (except for windows where visual studio does not support static link to openblas according to this https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/How-to-use-OpenBLAS-in-Microsoft-Visual-Studio see bottom). On ubuntu and centos7 we changed from `apt get`/ `yum` openblas and lapack to building openblas(blas+lapack) from source. Also we add a flag to support LAPACKE api for non-mkl builds. The original description is below:\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nIn mxnet we wrap lapack functions in c_lapack_api.h so that we hide the differences in the underlying blas/lapack libraries such as mkl, openblas, atlas, and accelerate.\r\n\r\nFor mkl we use/wrap the LAPACKE (https://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapacke.html) c interfaces which are the cleanest. For the rest of the libraries we wrap the old CLAPACK interfaces.\r\n\r\nOpenblas is by default built with lapack support and the binary will contain a full set of LAPACKE functions. Thus this poc adds a build option with which we can use the LAPACKE apis even for openblas.\r\n\r\nThis change will make ilp64 blas/lapack support easier as now we have the same wrapping logic or both mkl and openblas with USE_LAPACKE_INTERFACE = ON. Support for ilp64 mkl #19067 will automatically mean support for ilp64 openblas.\r\n\r\nKnown issue: linux distros ship openblas binaries WITHOUT lapack so this option can only work if we build openblas from source. This is not a problem for our mxnet binary distributions as we always use our own openblas build there. However, For users building mxnet from source they must be advised against using this option unless they also build openblas from

Description ##\r\nThis is a backport to v1.x of the PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/18424.  The original PR built on the work of @larroy, and introduced the `with environment():` context and `@with_environment()` decorator.  The PR replaced the ad hoc manipulation of environment variables in unittests and solved the 'read-only env var state' problem of Windows.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] PR's

mxnet we wrap lapack functions in c_lapack_api.h so that we hide the differences in the underlying blas/lapack libraries such as mkl, openblas, atlas, and accelerate. \r\n\r\nFor mkl we use/wrap the LAPACKE (https://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapacke.html) c interfaces which are the cleanest. For the rest of the libraries we wrap the old CLAPACK interfaces. \r\n\r\nWhile atlas and accelerate don't provide the LAPACKE interfaces, openblas does have it. This pr makes mxnet also use the LAPACKE apis when openblas is chosen. \r\n\r\nThis change will make ilp64 blas/lapack support easier as now we have the same wrapping logic or both mkl and openblas. Support for ilp64 mkl https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/19067 will automatically mean support for ilp64 openblas.

Description ##\r\nCUDA graphs is a feature of CUDA 10, which enables lowering CPU overhead by bundling multiple kernel launches together.\r\n\r\nThe main limitation of CUDA graphs is that they do require the graph to be static - no parameters to the kernels can change, otherwise the graph needs to be recaptured. That is why this feature is currently only enabled for the symbolic models and Gluon models hybridized with `hybridize(static_alloc=True, static_shape=True)`.\r\n\r\nThe feature is not enabled by default and requires environment variable `MXNET_ENABLE_CUDA_GRAPHS` to be set. In order to not capture the operations, the execution of which may change during the course of the training job, stateful operators and operators relying on resources other than workspace are not included in the graph.\r\n\r\nSince the feature lowers the CPU overhead of the execution, the impact is most visible in the inference or scale-out workloads with small batch size. Let us consider following script comparing fp16, batch size 1 inference of RN50v2 model from GluonCV with and without graphs:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nimport gluoncv as gcv\r\nfrom gluoncv.model_zoo import get_model\r\nimport time\r\nimport os\r\n\r\nnet = get_model('ResNet50_V2')\r\nnet2 = get_model('ResNet50_V2')\r\n\r\nnet.initialize(ctx=mx.gpu())\r\nnet2.initialize(ctx=mx.gpu())\r\n\r\nnet.cast('float16')\r\nnet2.cast('float16')\r\n\r\nnet.hybridize(static_alloc=True, static_shape=True)\r\nnet2.hybridize(static_alloc=True, static_shape=True)\r\n\r\nimg = mx.random.uniform(shape=(1, 3, 224, 224), ctx=mx.gpu(), dtype='float16')\r\n\r\nos.environ[\"MXNET_ENABLE_CUDA_GRAPHS\"] = \"0\"\r\n\r\nfor _ in range(10):\r\n    o = net(img)\r\n\r\nmx.nd.waitall()\r\n\r\ns = time.time()\r\nfor _ in range(1000):\r\n    o = net(img)\r\n\r\nmx.nd.waitall()\r\ne = time.time()\r\nprint(\"No graphs: \", e - s)\r\nmx.nd.waitall()\r\n\r\nos.environ[\"MXNET_ENABLE_CUDA_GRAPHS\"] = \"1\"\r\n\r\nfor _ in range(10):\r\n    o = net2(img)\r\n\r\nmx.nd.waitall()\r\n\r\ns = time.time()\r\nfor _ in range(1000):\r\n    o = net2(img)\r\n\r\nmx.nd.waitall()\r\ne = time.time()\r\nprint(\"With graphs: \", e - s)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result obtained on V100 16GB:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[20:33:46] ../src/operator/nn/./cudnn/./cudnn_algoreg-inl.h:97: Running performance tests to find the best convolution algorithm, this can take a while... (set the environment variable MXNET_CUDNN_AUTOTUNE_DEFAULT to 0 to disable)\r\nNo graphs:  2.8153152465820312\r\nWith graphs:  2.3230245113372803\r\n```\r\n\r\nso over 17% increase in performance. The same script but with 128 batch size gives much smaller improvement:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[20:38:34] ../src/operator/nn/./cudnn/./cudnn_algoreg-inl.h:97: Running performance tests to find the best convolution algorithm, this can take a while...

coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Added a specific split operator for GPU\r\n- [x] The implementation includes optimal CUDA kernel that identifies if split is performed along last_axis or another, having different paths depending on that. \r\n\r\nPerformance for several scenarios can be find

the last axis is smaller than 128, the new implementation performs in general worse than original version. Thus, in those cases we redirect those scenarios to run the original version.\r\n\r\n

the size of libmxnet.so grows to near 2GB, with increased functionality and the addition of cuda architectures, we're running into link failures, e.g. see issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17045\r\n\r\nOne technique that lowers lib size dramatically is 'fatbin compression', enabled by the nvcc options `--fatbin-options -compress-all`.  This has been always a part of Makefile builds, but this PR adds it to the cmake builds.  Specifically, this PR adds support to CMakeLists.txt for the cmake option `-DUSE_FATBIN_COMPRESSION={ON,OFF}`, with a default of ON for CUDA 11 builds and beyond.  This PR proposes to leave existing cmake builds against 10.2 as they are, without fatbin compression, to avoid unnecessarily introducing unforeseen consequences to existing use cases.\r\n\r\nResults of experiments building the 1.x branch with cuda11:\r\n\r\nWith cmake options `-DMXNET_CUDA_ARCH=\"5.2 6.0 6.1 7.0 7.2 7.5 8.0\" -DUSE_FATBIN_COMPRESSION=OFF`, a cuda11 build fails with link error:\r\n```\r\nlibmxnet.so: PC-relative offset overflow in PLT entry for void mxnet::op::mxnet_op::Kernel<...> ...\r\n```\r\nWith the same above cmake options, but dropping arches 5.2 and 7.2, the build succeeds with a libmxnet.so size of 1.8GB.\r\nFinally, with the same first cmake options `-DMXNET_CUDA_ARCH=\"5.2 6.0 6.1 7.0 7.2 7.5 8.0\"` a cuda11 build (using fatbin compression then by default) succeeds with a libmxnet.so size of 750MB, so over a 2X decrease in size.\r\n\r\nBoth succeeding builds, one with fatbin compression and one without, ran the command:\r\n```\r\ntime python -c \"import mxnet as mx; x = mx.nd.array([1,], ctx=mx.gpu(0)); print((x+1).asnumpy()))\"\r\n[2.]\r\n```\r\nin the same time of 7.6 secs.\r\n\r\n@samskalicky @anirudh2290 @ChaiBapchya @ptrendx

Description ##\r\nThis PR started out as a backport #16131 to v1.x. But then ran into some issues with MKLDNN subgraphing. I wasnt able to enhance the MKLDNN subgraphing to work with deduplicated inputs/outputs since there were too many hard-coded magic numbers to decode. Instead I added a flag `dedup_subgraph` to enable deduplicating subgraph inputs/outputs for our needs, but disable it by default to keep current MKLDNN/TensorRT and any other partitioning flows. \r\n\r\nSo now we set an attribute on the `Graph` and check for it in _build_subgraph.cc_ \"dedup_subgraph\":\r\n```\r\nbool dedup_subgraph = g->HasAttr(\"dedup_subgraph\");\r\n...\r\nCutGraphInputs(input_entries, &orig_input_entries, &unique_orig_entries,\r\n                 &unique_input_entries, false, dedup_subgraph);\r\n...\r\nif (dedup_subgraph)\r\n      subg_prop->ConnectSubgraphInputs(n, &unique_input_entries, &unique_orig_entries);\r\nelse\r\n      subg_prop->ConnectSubgraphInputs(n, &input_entries, &orig_input_entries);\r\n```\r\nWe set this attribute on the `Graph` in `MXOptimizeForBackend `:\r\n```\r\n// set dedup option as attribute on graph to enable dedup during partitioning\r\nif (options_map.count(\"dedup_subgraph\") > 0 &&\r\n      options_map.at(\"dedup_subgraph\").compare(\"True\") == 0)\r\ng.attrs[\"dedup_subgraph\"] = std::make_shared<nnvm::any>(std::string(\"True\"));\r\n```\r\nAnd it is set by users as an argument to `optimize_for`:\r\n```\r\npart_sym = sym.optimize_for(subgraph_backend, arg_dict, aux_dict, dedup_subgraph=True)\r\n```","created_at":"2020-09-10T17:28:29Z","updated_at":"2020-09-28T15:28:27Z","closed_at":"2020-09-15T05:57:06Z","merged_at":"2020-09-15T05:57:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"9dfac79d5acb9e9a195c86aae919a6acaf3de4bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.
