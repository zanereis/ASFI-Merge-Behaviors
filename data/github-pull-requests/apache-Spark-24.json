If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes `TransformWithStateExec` so when its `hasInitialState` is false, the `initialState` won't be rewritten by planner incorrectly to produce invalid query plan which will cause unexpected errors for extension rules that rely on the correctness of query plan.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[SPARK-47363](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-47363) added the support for users to provide initial state for streaming query. Such query operators like `TransformWithStateExec` might have `hasInitialState` as false which means the initial state related parameters are not used. But when query planner applies rules on the query, it will still apply on the initial state query plan. When `hasInitialState` is false, some related parameters like `initialStateGroupingAttrs` are invalid and some rules will use these invalid parameters to transform the initial state query plan.\r\n\r\nFor example, `EnsureRequirements` may apply invalid Sort and Exchange on the initial query plan. We encountered these invalid query plan in our extension rules.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr moves the global scope test configuration `spark.hadoop.hadoop.security.key.provider.path`, which is configured in the parent `pom.xml` and `SparkBuild.scala`, to `OrcEncryptionSuite` to ensure that it is effective only within `OrcEncryptionSuite`.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, the pr also refactors `OrcEncryptionSuite`:\r\n1. Overrides `beforeAll` to back up the contents of `CryptoUtils#keyProviderCache`.\r\n2. Overrides `afterAll` to restore the contents of `CryptoUtils#keyProviderCache`.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that `CryptoUtils#keyProviderCache` is isolated during the test process of `OrcEncryptionSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe test configuration `spark.hadoop.hadoop.security.key.provider.path` in the parent `pom.xml` and `SparkBuild.scala` is effective globally, which leads to the possibility that other Orc writing test cases, besides `OrcEncryptionSuite`, might also be affected by this configuration and use `test.org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.orc.FakeKeyProvider.Factory`。\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, just for test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-07-31T02:52:13Z","updated_at":"2024-08-01T02:29:53Z","closed_at":"2024-07-31T19:02:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3022a1f82f995b26b9e51d55f0c3158d3081856","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47543/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47543/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47543/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0d4cc7849278a186929e28b021b54e48be1697c2","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-49066","ref":"SPARK-49066","sha":"0d4cc7849278a186929e28b021b54e48be1697c2","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExplicitly pass the overridden timezone parameter to `rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros` and `rebaseGregorianToJulianMicros`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, rebasing timestamp defaults to JVM timezone and so it produces incorrect results when the explicitly over-riden timezone in the TimestampFormatter library is not the same as JVM timezone.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UT to capture this scenario\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMoves `SessionHolder.forTetsing(...)` into the package; the new and equivalent method lies in `SparkConnectTestUtils.createDummySessionHolder(...)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe `SessionHolder.forTesting(...)` method is widely used in several Spark Connect testing suites. However, this test-specific code is located in the source code, and incorrect use may lead to the creation of a partial/buggy Spark Connect session during production runtime.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. \r\nCode running in the Server JVM will no longer be able to create a dummy Session Holder during live execution by calling `SessionHolder.forTesting(...)`.\r\nNote that usage of this during live execution is unwanted behaviours as it would lead to creation of a partial `SessionHolder` instance.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI'm trying to implement a way to enhance the metrics in SQL tab with info in logical plan which can help track some info for optimizer. I've searched the jira for the \"metrics ui logical plan\", but not got the right one. So I try to add it via this PR.\r\nIn this PR, I get the est stats from the LogicalPlan via  class SparkPlan's logicalLink and store it in the class SparkPlanInfo metadata field.\r\nBut there is no such info in class SparkPlanGraphNode, which is the UI node for the SQL tab.\r\nSo I add the metadata field, which is with the same type as SparkPlan and finally add it in the dotFile.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn current version, we can see the metrics in SQL tab which is collected in the execution phase, which ignored the info in optimization phase. With this change, the stats in the logical phase can be passed into the sql tab.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt only add two row for the metrics in the SparkPlan.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest in local history server to check the new row values.\r\nThe new stats is added in the metric graph.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo. \r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe missed the fact that submitting a shuffle or broadcast query stage can be heavy, as it needs to submit subqueries and wait for the results. This blocks the AQE loop and hurts the parallelism of AQE.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem by using shuffle/broadcast's own thread pool to wait for subqueries and other preparations.\r\n\r\nThis PR also re-implements https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45234 to avoid submitting the shuffle job if the query is failed and all query stages need to be cancelled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nbetter parallelism for AQE\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make `ErrorClassesJsonReader` handle null properly\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen `ErrorClassesJsonReader` takes null for `getErrorMessage` method, it cannot handle null properly so raises `INTERNAL_ERROR`.\r\n\r\nFor example, given error class example below:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"MISSING_PARAMETER\" : {\r\n    \"message\" : [\r\n      \"Parameter ${param} is missing.\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand run:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ngetErrorMessage(\"MISSING_PARAMETER\", Map(\"param\" -> null))\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```\r\n[INTERNAL_ERROR] Undefined error message parameter for error class: 'MISSING_PARAMETER', MessageTemplate: Parameter ${param} is missing., Parameters: Map(param -> null) SQLSTATE: XX000\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: [INTERNAL_ERROR] Undefined error message parameter for error class: 'MISSING_PARAMETER', MessageTemplate: Parameter ${param} is missing., Parameters: Map(param -> null) SQLSTATE: XX000\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n```\r\n[MISSING_PARAMETER] Parameter null is missing.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API changes, but this PR improves the user-facing error message as described above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for reading relevant operator metadata at given batch id\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNeeded to support reading state for operators that allow for schema changes across batch ids\r\n\r\nThis change also introduces the location for the state schema format for the v2 version. As part of this version, the operator metadata and the state schema will be written to the following locations:\r\n- for the operator metadata, this will be under the `<checkpoint_loc>/state/<operator_id>/ _metadata` directory\r\n- for the state schema, this will be under the `<checkpoint_loc>/state/<operator_id>/ _stateSchema` directory\r\n\r\nIn the older versions for the operator/state schema formats, this would be stored in the following location:\r\n- for the operator metadata, this will be under the `<checkpoint_loc>/state/<operator_id>/ _metadata` directory\r\n- for the state schema, this will be under the `<checkpoint_loc>/state/<operator_id>/ 0/<storeName>/_metadata/schema` directory\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\nAllows the user to specify a batchId while querying the operator metadata. This is a no-op for operators using metadata version 1 and will provide the right metadata from v2 onwards\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark\r\n   .read\r\n   .format(\"state-metadata\")\r\n   .option(\"batchId\",

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix `RewriteDistinctAggregates` rule to deal properly with aggregation on DISTINCT literals. Physical plan for `select count(distinct 1) from t`:\r\n```\r\n-- count(distinct 1)\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[count(distinct 1)], output=[count(DISTINCT 1)#2L])\r\n   +- HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[partial_count(distinct 1)], output=[count#6L])\r\n      +- HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[], output=[])\r\n         +- Exchange SinglePartition, ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [plan_id=20]\r\n            +- HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[], output=[])\r\n               +- FileScan parquet spark_catalog.default.t[] Batched: false, DataFilters: [], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(1 paths)[file:/Users/nikola.mandic/oss-spark/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.s..., PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<>\r\n```\r\nProblem is happening when `HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[], output=[])` node yields one row to `partial_count` node, which then captures one row. This four-node structure is constructed by `AggUtils.planAggregateWithOneDistinct`.\r\n\r\nTo fix the problem, we're adding `Expand` node which will force non-empty grouping expressions in `HashAggregateExec` nodes. This will in turn enable streaming zero rows to parent `partial_count` node, yielding correct final result.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAggregation with DISTINCT literal gives wrong results. For example, when running on empty table `t`:\r\n`select count(distinct 1) from t` returns 1, while the correct result should be 0.\r\nFor reference:\r\n`select count(1) from t` returns 0, which is the correct and expected result.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this fixes a critical bug in Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew e2e SQL tests for aggregates with DISTINCT literals.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn this PR was an extended error message for checkType in ValidateExternalType with information about child nodes.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen we have mixed schema rows, the error message \"{actual} is not a valid external type for schema of {expected}\" doesn't help to understand the column with the problem. I suggest adding information about the source column.\r\n\r\nAfter fix error message may contain extra info\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe external type [B is not valid for the type \"STRING\" at the expression \"getexternalrowfield(assertnotnull(input[0, org.apache.spark.sql.Row, true]), 0, f3)\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nclass ErrorMsgSuite extends AnyFunSuite with SharedSparkContext {\r\n  test(\"shouldThrowSchemaError\") {\r\n    val seq: Seq[Row] = Seq(\r\n      Row(\r\n        toBytes(\"0\"),\r\n        toBytes(\"\"),\r\n        1L,\r\n      ),\r\n      Row(\r\n        toBytes(\"0\"),\r\n        toBytes(\"\"),\r\n        1L,\r\n      ),\r\n    )    val schema: StructType = new StructType()\r\n      .add(\"f1\", BinaryType)\r\n      .add(\"f3\", StringType)\r\n      .add(\"f2\", LongType)    val df = sqlContext.createDataFrame(sqlContext.sparkContext.parallelize(seq), schema)    val exception = intercept[RuntimeException] {\r\n      df.show()\r\n    }    assert(\r\n      exception.getCause.getMessage\r\n        .contains(\"[B is not a valid external type for schema of string\")\r\n    )\r\n    assertResult(\r\n      \"[B is not a valid external type for schema of string\"\r\n    )(exception.getCause.getMessage)\r\n  }\r\n  def toBytes(x: String): Array[Byte] = x.toCharArray.map(_.toByte)\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter fix error message may contain extra info\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe external type [B is not valid for the type \"STRING\" at the expression \"getexternalrowfield(assertnotnull(input[0, org.apache.spark.sql.Row, true]), 0, f3)\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample: https://github.com/mrk-andreev/example-spark-schema/blob/main/spark_4.0.0/src/test/scala/ErrorMsgSuite.scala\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis changes extends error message in case of \"not a valid external type\". \r\n\r\n#### Example before\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.Integer is not a valid external type for schema of double\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Example after\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe external type [B is not valid for the type \"STRING\" at the expression \"getexternalrowfield(assertnotnull(input[0, org.apache.spark.sql.Row, true]), 0, c0)\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis changes covered by new unit test `test(\"SPARK-49044 ValidateExternalType should return child in error\")` and by new integration test `test(\"SPARK-49044 ValidateExternalType should be user visible\")`\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-29T16:29:31Z","updated_at":"2024-09-03T11:12:44Z","closed_at":"2024-09-03T11:11:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"479fc185a5821d5b5c8b975c7a13aa9f5d809418","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47522/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47522/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47522/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1f5fb4a937868f5a846daca5b5de7a658ee5ca58","head":{"label":"mrk-andreev:improve-error-for-cast-v2","ref":"improve-error-for-cast-v2","sha":"1f5fb4a937868f5a846daca5b5de7a658ee5ca58","user":{"login":"mrk-andreev","id":669347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTM0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/669347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev","html_url":"https://github.com/mrk-andreev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":484998266,"node_id":"R_kgDOHOh8eg","name":"spark","full_name":"mrk-andreev/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mrk-andreev","id":669347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTM0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/669347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev","html_url":"https://github.com/mrk-andreev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mrk-andreev/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to reset checkbox when executor metrics are loaded in the Stages tab.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe variable `executorSummaryTableSelector` in the `reselectCheckboxesBasedOnTaskTableState` function may not be initialized, which results in inconsistent UI display.\r\n\r\nSometimes `allexecutors` api calls are slow, which causes `executorSummaryTableSelector` to be initialized lazily.\r\n```js\r\n$.getJSON(createRESTEndPointForExecutorsPage(appId),\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"800\" alt=\"image\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch fixes an issue in the driver hosted Spark UI `SQL` tab DAG view where the invalid SQL metric values are not filtered out correctly and hence showing incorrect `minimum` and `median` metric values in the UI. This regression got introduced in #39311 .\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`SIZE`, `TIMING` and `NS_TIMING` metrics are [created](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9f22fa4d2acfcbc42d6d76a28778885cbdad733d/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/metric/SQLMetrics.scala#L155-L182) with initial value `-1` (given `0` is a valid metric value for them). The `SQLMetrics.stringValue` method filters out the invalid values using condition: `value >= 0` before calculating the `min`, `med` and `max` values. But #39311 introduced in Spark `3.4.0` introduced a regression where the `SQLMetric.value` is always `>= 0`. This means that the invalid accumulators with value `-1` are no longer invalid to get filtered out correctly. This needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, as end users can access accumulator values directly. Users accessing the values in the physical plan programmatically should use `SQLMetric.isZero` before consuming its value.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests; Created new jar for Spark `3.5.1` and confirms that the incorrect data is shown correctly in Spark UI now.\r\n\r\nOld UI view:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLike SPARK-49033, this PR aims to support server-side `sparkProperties` replacement in REST Submission API.\r\n\r\n- For example, ephemeral Spark clusters with server-side environment variables can provide backend-resource and information without touching client-side applications and configurations.\r\n\r\n- The place holder pattern is `{{SERVER_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME}}` style like the following.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/163e512c53208301a8511310023d930d8b77db96/docs/configuration.md?plain=1#L694\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/163e512c53208301a8511310023d930d8b77db96/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/rest/StandaloneRestServer.scala#L233-L234\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nA user can submits an environment variable holder like `{{AWS_ENDPOINT_URL}}` in order to use server-wide environment variables of Spark Master.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ SPARK_MASTER_OPTS=\"-Dspark.master.rest.enabled=true\" \\\r\n  AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=ENDPOINT_FOR_THIS_CLUSTER \\\r\n  sbin/start-master.sh\r\n\r\n$ sbin/start-worker.sh

_any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a new feature and disabled by default via `spark.master.rest.enabled (default: false)`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with newly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support server-side environment variable replacement in REST Submission API.\r\n\r\n- For example, ephemeral Spark clusters with server-side environment variables can provide backend-resource and information without touching client-side applications and configurations.\r\n\r\n- The place holder pattern is `{{SERVER_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME}}` style like the following.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/163e512c53208301a8511310023d930d8b77db96/docs/configuration.md?plain=1#L694\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/163e512c53208301a8511310023d930d8b77db96/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/rest/StandaloneRestServer.scala#L233-L234\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nA user can submits an environment variable holder like `{{AWS_CA_BUNDLE}}` and `{{AWS_ENDPOINT_URL}}` in order to use server-wide environment variables of Spark Master.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ SPARK_MASTER_OPTS=\"-Dspark.master.rest.enabled=true\" \\\r\n  AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=ENDPOINT_FOR_THIS_CLUSTER \\\r\n  sbin/start-master.sh\r\n\r\n$ sbin/start-worker.sh

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChanged hash function to be collation aware. This change is just for interpreted code path. Codegen hashing was already collation aware.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe were getting the wrong hash for collated strings because our hash function only used the binary representation of the string. It didn't take collation into account.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to `HashExpressionsSuite.scala`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPropagate function signature of `func` in `DataFrame(...).transform(...)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPropagating the function signature for `func` in `DataFrame(...).transform(...)` enables type checkers like `mypy` to enforce that `func` is being correctly called through `transform`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it allows the user to better leverage type checking tools when using `DataFrame(...).transform(...)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRan example script that passes `add_num` to `transform` with inappropriate arguments:\r\n- first running mypy on `master`, showing that no mypy errors are raised\r\n- then running mypy with the changes in this PR on the `type-hint-transform-args-kwargs` branch\r\n   - this shows that the expected mypy errors are raised\r\n\r\n<details><summary>screenshot of no mypy errors on master</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<img

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve `MasterPage` to support custom title.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen there exists multiple Spark clusters, custom title can be more helpful than the spark master address because it can contain semantics like the role of the clusters. In addition, the URL field in the same page already provides the spark master information even when we use a custom title.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```\r\nsbin/start-master.sh\r\n```\r\n![Screenshot

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, OperatorStateMetadataV2 and StateSchemaV3 files are written for every new query run. This PR will implement purging files so we only keep `minLogEntriesToMaintain` files per query.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese changes are needed so that we don't indefinitely keep these files across many query runs, bounding the number of state files we keep\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use `17-jammy` tag instead of `17-jre` to prevent Python 12.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTwo days ago, `eclipse-temurin:17` switched its baseline OS to `Ubuntu 24.04` which brings `Python 3.12`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ docker run -it --rm eclipse-temurin:17-jre cat /etc/os-release | grep VERSION_ID\r\nVERSION_ID=\"24.04\"\r\n\r\n$ docker run -it --rm eclipse-temurin:17-jammy cat /etc/os-release | grep VERSION_ID\r\nVERSION_ID=\"22.04\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince Python 3.12 supported is added only to Apache Spark 4.0.0, we need to keep using the previous OS, `Ubuntu 22.04`.\r\n\r\n- #43184\r\n- #43192\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This aims to recover to the same OS for consistent behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with K8s IT. Currently, it's broken at Python image building phase.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/workflows/build_branch34.yml\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-07-25T16:25:56Z","updated_at":"2024-07-26T03:35:45Z","closed_at":"2024-07-25T17:43:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"af56e0ab4e3a26591eedd2425726ad7ff9239acb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47489/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47489/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47489/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eb495f228644239505d6dcb0e6d4b71f6895f359","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-49005-3.4","ref":"SPARK-49005-3.4","sha":"eb495f228644239505d6dcb0e6d4b71f6895f359","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use `17-jammy` tag instead of `17` to prevent Python 12.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTwo days ago, `eclipse-temurin:17` switched its baseline OS to `Ubuntu 24.04` which brings `Python 3.12`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ docker run -it --rm eclipse-temurin:17 cat /etc/os-release | grep VERSION_ID\r\nVERSION_ID=\"24.04\"\r\n\r\n$ docker run -it --rm eclipse-temurin:17-jammy cat /etc/os-release | grep VERSION_ID\r\nVERSION_ID=\"22.04\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince Python 3.12 supported is added only to Apache Spark 4.0.0, we need to keep using the previous OS, `Ubuntu 22.04`.\r\n\r\n- #43184\r\n- #43192\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This aims to recover to the same OS for consistent behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with K8s IT. Currently, it's broken at Python image building phase.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/workflows/build_branch35.yml\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-07-25T16:24:21Z","updated_at":"2024-07-26T03:35:22Z","closed_at":"2024-07-25T17:42:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bf9d78d01a4c9065aac4cb977cbe6f654510c3ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47488/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47488/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47488/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/41793df67407c6bb6c3180383132d6f0c5dedb53","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-49005","ref":"SPARK-49005","sha":"41793df67407c6bb6c3180383132d6f0c5dedb53","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies some Mima rules which are used for checking the binary compatibility between `sql` and `connect` modules. Major changes include:\r\n\r\n- Removed unnecessary filters for specific `private[sql]` constructors - there's a wildcard rule which filters out all of them.\r\n- Removed outdated filters about APIs that are already consistent.\r\n- Add a warning about unused filters.\r\n\r\nCurrent output:\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./dev/connect-jvm-client-mima-check\r\nDo connect-client-jvm module mima check ...\r\nWarning: ExcludeByName[Problem](\"org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset.queryExecution\") did not filter out any problems.\r\nWarning: ExcludeByName[Problem](\"org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset.sqlContext\") did not filter out any problems.\r\nWarning: ExcludeByName[Problem](\"org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset.selectUntyped\") did not filter out any problems.\r\nWarning: ExcludeByName[Problem](\"org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset.rdd\") did not filter out any problems.\r\nWarning: ExcludeByName[Problem](\"org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset.toJavaRDD\") did not filter out any problems.\r\nWarning: ExcludeByName[Problem](\"org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset.javaRDD\") did not filter out any problems.\r\nfinish connect-client-jvm module mima check ...\r\nconnect-client-jvm module mima check passed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI manually audited all rules defined in the list.\r\n\r\nOne issue I found is that all APIs in `Dataset` are not being checked at all, likely due to having a `private[sql]` companion object in `spark-core`. Changing the object's visibility from `private[sql]` to `public` will resolve this issue. The exact reason is unknown and is to be investigated.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nNeed to make sure Mima is really working.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNot needed.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-07-25T15:51:39Z","updated_at":"2024-08-05T11:16:59Z","closed_at":"2024-08-05T10:11:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1bc2477056d82428160c4ea6359568f2c2426425","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47487/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47487/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47487/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dff6b7d76c3121dbe0f7ebdf145fd20279385ea6","head":{"label":"xupefei:mima-refactor","ref":"mima-refactor","sha":"dff6b7d76c3121dbe0f7ebdf145fd20279385ea6","user":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":777257207,"node_id":"R_kgDOLlQA9w","name":"spark","full_name":"xupefei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei/spark","description":"Apache

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe are now consistently handling invalid location/path values for all database objects in this pull request. Before this PR, we only checked for `null` and `\"\"` for a small group of operations, such as `SetNamespaceLocation` and `CreateNamespace`. However, various other commands or queries involved with location did not undergo verification. Besides, we also didn't apply suitable error classes for other syntax errors like `null` and `\"\"`.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we add a try-catch block to rethrow INVALID_LOCATION errors for `null`, `\"\"` and all other invalid inputs. And all operations for databases, tables, partitions, raw paths are validated. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor better and consistent path errors\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, IllegalArgumentException thrown by path parsing is replaced with INVALID_LOCATION\r\nerror\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n(Cherry-pick of 57948c865e064469a75c92f8b58c632b9b40fdd3 to branch-3.5)\r\n\r\nCompute the schema of the data without partition columns only once in FileSourceStrategy.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn FileSourceStrategy, the schema of the data excluding partition columns is computed 2 times in a slightly different way, using an AttributeSet (`partitionSet`) and using the attributes directly (`partitionColumns`) These don't have the exact same semantics, AttributeSet will only use expression ids for comparison while comparing with the actual attributes will use the name, type, nullability and metadata. We want to use the former here.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Johan Lasperas

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix SparkStrategy for Aggregates dealing with DISTINCT literals.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAggregation with DISTINCT literal gives wrong results. For example:\r\n`select count(distinct 1) from t` returns 1, while the correct result should be 0.\r\nFor reference:\r\n`select count(1) from t` returns 0, which is the correct and expected result.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this fixes a critical bug in Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew e2e SQL tests for aggregates with DISTINCT literals.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-25T06:13:39Z","updated_at":"2024-07-30T22:35:25Z","closed_at":"2024-07-30T22:35:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c9da59adab438a82818635a4701904a26fb5f86a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47482/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47482/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47482/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5c7fc9a1b5780eb23a39011c8d70007775c3cf88","head":{"label":"uros-db:agg-distinct","ref":"agg-distinct","sha":"5c7fc9a1b5780eb23a39011c8d70007775c3cf88","user":{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":755209418,"node_id":"R_kgDOLQOUyg","name":"spark","full_name":"uros-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, an exception in the maintenance thread pool today can cause the entire executor to exit (or in some cases, deadlock). This PR changes the maintenance thread pool exception logic to _only_ unload the providers that throw exceptions—the entire thread pool is not stopped.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the way that we bubbled exceptions to the maintenance thread task (which manages the pool) was in the following way:\r\n\r\n- A thread in the maintenance thread pool sees an exception and it sets `threadPoolException` to be non-null\r\n- The next time that `doMaintenance()` gets called by the maintenance task (which is scheduled periodically), it checks to see whether that exception is non-null\r\n- If it is non-null, it throws that exception\r\n- It then _catches_ that exception, and stops the thread pool\r\n\r\nBut now that we don't need to stop the entire maintenance thread pool and unload _all_ of the providers, when an exception is encountered in a maintenance thread pool thread, we can just have that thread unload itself. Then, we can remove the `onError` callback because it will no longer be needed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPlease see the JIRA for a full description of the error conditions. We don't want executors to exit because of maintenance thread pool thread failures.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- All existing UTs must pass. One test was removed, though (see below).\r\n- Added a new UT where a fake state store provider is used; this state store provider throws exceptions for partitions 0 and 1. The UT asserts that these two providers become unloaded, but any other ones are _not_. \r\n\r\nThere was an existing test, `SPARK-44438: maintenance task should be shutdown on error`, which actually mentions that the `SparkUncaughtExceptionHandler` should not be invoked even if there is an exception. However, this test does _not_ load more than 1 provider. Thus, the only loaded provider is the one that experiences the exception. We know that the root-cause of this issue is that if there exists _another_ provider that is waiting on a lock (i.e. on an RPC in `verifyStateStoreInstanceActive`), then that provider will receive an `InterruptedException`, which will lead to the `SparkUncaughtExceptionHandler` firing.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-25T00:51:55Z","updated_at":"2024-09-19T17:13:23Z","closed_at":"2024-07-30T08:22:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5ffc7da6caaa8aba55506dba554b905f7b3bf61e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAllows bare literals for `__and__` and `__or__` of Column API in Spark Classic.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently bare literals are not allowed for `__and__` and `__or__` of Column API in Spark Classic and need to wrap with `lit()` function. It should be allowed similar to other similar operators.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import *\r\n>>> c = col(\"c\")\r\n>>> c & True\r\nTraceback (most recent call

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAPI parity\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now `StreamingQuery.lastProgress` returns the actual `StreamingQueryProgress` (and `StreamingQuery.recentProgress` returns `List[StreamingQueryProgress]`). \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to unified `variable` related `SQL syntax` keywords, enable syntax `DECLARE (OR REPLACE)? ...` and `DROP TEMPORARY ...` to support keyword: `VAR` (not only `VARIABLE`).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen `setting` variables, we support `(VARIABLE | VAR)`, but when `declaring` and `dropping` variables, we only support the keyword `VARIABLE` (not support the keyword `VAR`)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"597\" alt=\"image\"

syntax seems `a bit weird`, `inconsistent experience` in SQL syntax related to variable usage by end-users, so I propose to `unify` it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, enable end-users to use `variable related SQL` with `consistent` keywords.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated existed UT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nDisable the listener test. This test would fail after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46921, which is now reverted. The reason was because with #46921, the server starts a server side python process which serializes the `StreamingQueryProgress` object with the new `StreamingQueryProgress` change. But in the client, the client tries to deserialize `StreamingQueryProgress` use the old `StreamingQueryProgress` without the change, which caused serde error. \r\n\r\nHowever, as the change is going to spark 4.0, and is considered a generally good improvement and does more good than harm, we would like to disable this test to bring back #46921.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nUnblock bringing back #46921\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNo need\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`DefaultParamsReader/Writer` handle metadata with spark session\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn existing ml implementations, when loading/saving a model, it loads/saves the metadata with `SparkContext` then loads/saves the coefficients with `SparkSession`.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to also load/save the metadata with `SparkSession`, by introducing new helper functions.\r\n\r\n- Note I: 3-rd libraries (e.g. [xgboost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/jvm-packages/xgboost4j-spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/util/XGBoostReadWrite.scala#L38-L53) ) likely depends on existing implementation of saveMetadata/loadMetadata, so we cannot simply remove them even though they are `private[ml]`.\r\n\r\n- Note II: this PR only handles `loadMetadata` and `saveMetadata`, there are similar cases for meta algorithms and param read/write, but I want to ignore the remaining part first, to avoid touching too many files in single PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCI\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces an intermediate representation for Column operations. It also adds a converter from this IR to Catalyst Expression. This is a first step in sharing Column API between Classic and Connect. It is not integrated with any of the pre-existing code base.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want to share the Scala Column API between the Classic and Connect Scala DataFrame API implementations. For this we need to decouple the Column API from Catalyst.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI added a test suite that tests the conversion from `ColumnNode` to `Expression`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-07-24T02:09:20Z","updated_at":"2024-07-26T19:33:33Z","closed_at":"2024-07-26T19:33:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"80cf79c0ebca852d8b3d356fea8ef00bd8f626fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47466/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47466/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47466/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2d30e57bdd918ab502ff5ff46cada19388ca1fa8","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-48986","ref":"SPARK-48986","sha":"2d30e57bdd918ab502ff5ff46cada19388ca1fa8","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are a number of hard coded expressions in the SparkConnectPlanner. Most of these expressions are hardcoded because they are missing a proper constructor, or because they are not registered in the FunctionRegistry. The Column API has a similar problem. This PR fixes most of these exceptions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReduce the number of hard coded expressions in the SparkConnectPlanner and the Column API. This will make it significantly easier to create an implementation agnostic Column API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-07-24T01:25:05Z","updated_at":"2024-07-28T02:19:41Z","closed_at":"2024-07-28T02:19:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"07caa8294baadcc4fa0cfd012806522c8e6f5bdb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47464/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47464/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47464/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/452a1069a5112d87e28d234f62cf9ded3d1b1fa6","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-48985","ref":"SPARK-48985","sha":"452a1069a5112d87e28d234f62cf9ded3d1b1fa6","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhov
