[hazelcast](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast) from 3.1.5 to 5.3.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/releases\">hazelcast's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.3.0</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast Platform 5.3.0 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues and pull requests in Hazelcast's GitHub repository.</p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Connector for Kafka Connect source (BETA)</strong>: Import data from an external system directly into a Hazelcast data pipeline without the need of a Kafka cluster.</li>\n<li><strong>Connector for MongoDB (BETA)</strong>: Read and write from/to MongoDB via this connector and execute SQL queries on Mongo collections directly from Hazelcast.</li>\n<li><strong>Partition-Aware SQL Client</strong>: Send the SQL commands only to the members having the relevant data, which reduces the network hops and improves the query performances.</li>\n<li><strong>Data connection support in SQL</strong>: data connections and mappings using them can be managed using SQL commands.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Renamed the <code>DataLinkFactory</code> interface as <code>DataConnection</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24224\">#24224</a></li>\n<li>Removed the <code>TO_ROW</code> function as it is obsolete, you can use <code>CAST (udtObj AS JSON)</code> instead. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23808\">#23808</a></li>\n<li>SQL mappings for internal maps (<code>__sql.catalog</code> and <code>__jet.*</code>) cannot be created anymore. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24282\">#24282</a></li>\n<li>Changed the default cloud coordinator URL from <code>coordinator.hazelcast.cloud</code> to <code>api.viridian.hazelcast.com</code>.\nThe default configuration now connects to <a href=\"https://viridian.hazelcast.com/sign-in?next=/\">https://viridian.hazelcast.com/sign-in?next=/</a> instead of Hazelcast Cloud.\nIf you want to continue accessing your Hazelcast Cloud clusters, you need to set the <code>hazelcast.client.cloud.url</code> property to <code>https://coordinator.hazelcast.cloud</code> in your configuration. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23290\">#23290</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<h3>Cloud</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hazelcast was sending requests to Kubernetes API when deploying an application with embedded Hazelcast and <code>service-dns</code> (DNS lookup mode) specified to a Kubernetes cluster.\nThis was causing the requests to be unsuccessful and the application not to start. This mechanism has been improved by creating Kubernetes client only for the DNS lookup mode. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23883\">#23883</a></li>\n<li>When advanced networking is enabled, the Kubernetes discovery plugin might have been discovering several endpoints (per each port)\nfor each member's pod.

multiple methods with the same cache name but having different keys. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/17284\">#17284</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed an issue where the repeated calls of <code>executeOnKeys()</code> in Hazelcast clients for <code>NATIVE</code> maps was causing a continuous increase in the used memory and exhaustion of the memory pool after a while. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/17271\">#17271</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a performance issue when using paging predicates with JDK 8. <a

issues for <strong>Hazelcast IMDG v3.12.8</strong>, Open Source edition release.</p>\n<h1>Enhancements</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Introduced WAN throttling mechanism: this prevents the WAN consumers from getting overloaded by the WAN producers if transferring the WAN events takes less time than processing them in the target cluster. This can be the case with WAN synchronization if the network latency is low enough. It can be configured using the following properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>hazelcast.wan.consumer.invocation.threshold</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>hazelcast.wan.consumer.ack.delay.backoff.init</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>hazelcast.wan.consumer.ack.delay.backoff.max</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Notes</a></p>\n<h2>v3.11-BETA-1</h2>\n<p>3.11-BETA-1 release</p>\n<h2>3.10.7</h2>\n<p>This document includes the new features, enhancements and fixed issues for <strong>Hazelcast IMDG v3.10.7</strong>, Open Source edition release.</p>\n<h1>Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the Near Cache invalidation was not working properly when used with Transactional Map. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16617\">#16617</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.10.6</h2>\n<p>This document includes the new features, enhancements and fixed issues for Hazelcast IMDG v3.10.6, Open Source edition release.</p>\n<h1>Enhancements</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the ability to log <code>IOException</code>s thrown by the ICMP ping task as ping failures. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13826\">#13826</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Entry processors equipped with predicates try to utilize global indexes to narrow down the key set to operate on. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13892\">#13892</a> fixes the following issues for this utilization:\n<ul>\n<li>There were no migration stamp validations performed to prevent entry processors from operating on stale index data.</li>\n<li><code>WrongTargetException</code> was not thrown for out-migrated partitions, as a result the caller (<code>InvokeOnPartitions</code>) was not retrying entry processors on such partitions.</li>\n<li>Partition scope provided to <code>PartitionIteratingOperation</code> was not respected. As a result, operations produced by factories providing their own partition sets were running on more partitions than expected.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fixed the incorrect dependencies in <code>hazelcast-all.pom</code>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13885\">#13885</a></li>\n<li>Hazelcast lacks a mechanism for the client/server recovery within Spring cache context. This is fixed by recreating the local cache configurations when the client is connecting to a restarted member. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13811\">#13811</a></li>\n<li>Clients were sometimes failing to reconnect to another owner member with the <code>ExecutionException</code>. This is fixed by making <code>ClientReauthOperation</code> to be retryable. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13790\">#13790</a></li>\n<li>When an <code>unserializableResponse</code> is tried to be sent to the client as a response from the executor service tasks, the exception was logged on the server side and there was no response returned back to the client. This has been fixed by removing the logging and sending <code>HazelcastSerializationException</code> to the client. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13777\">#13777</a></li>\n<li>Queryable entries returned by High-Density Memory Store indexes were unaware of the map value extractors, so it was not possible to extract values provided by the extractors from the returned entries. This is fixed by forwarding the map value extractor to these indexes. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13775\">#13775</a></li>\n<li>Hazelcast 3.10.5 client was not being auto-discovered on Kubernetes. This is fixed by using a specific TLS version, namely v1.2, for <code>SSLContext</code>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13760\">#13760</a></li>\n<li>There is a scheduled task to clean the client resources. When an endpoint is removed, this task keeps a reference to it and this was causing unnecessary leak. This is fixed by passing only the necessary field objects of the client endpoint to this task to avoid keeping reference to the client endpoint itself. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13755\">#13755</a></li>\n<li>When merging MultiMap entries, <code>MERGE</code> events were being fired. Now they are not since MultiMap does not have a merging listener. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13714\">#13714</a></li>\n<li>Fixed the heartbeat resume mechanism where the heartbeat of a connection was becoming unhealthy when the last read time is lower than the heartbeat timeout. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13684\">#13684</a></li>\n<li>Added the <code>storage.clear</code> operation before <code>storage.destroy</code> to release the High-Density (HD) Memory Store resources, since using only <code>storage.destroy</code> releases the internal resources of backing data structure, not the HD resources. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13659\">#13659</a></li>\n<li>Moved the alive check in <code>ClientConnectionManager</code> to a more centralized method and fixed the exception type. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13525\">#13525</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where a joining member was not validating the initial cluster version. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13390\">#13390</a></li>\n<li>When a Near Cache is used for an IMap and a TransactionalMap is used on a client then the <code>get(key)</code> operation fails reporting a wrong key type. This is fixed by skipping the Near Cache lookup at the member side, for the client’s transaction request. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13371\">#13371</a></li>\n<li><code>HDTxnSetOperation</code> was not taking the changes made by MapInterceptor into account while sending the backups. Now it replicates the result of <code>interceptPut</code>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12705\">#12705</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.10.5</h2>\n<p>This document includes the new features, enhancements and fixed issues for Hazelcast IMDG v3.10.5, Open Source edition release.</p>\n<h1>Enhancements</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduced OperationThreadSamples as a new diagnostics plugin. It samples the operation threads and checks the running operations/tasks. See <a href=\"http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10.5/manual/html-single/#operationthreadsamples\">OperationThreadSamples</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a workaround for the <code>Constructor cache</code>, which performs caching under incorrect keys, such that you have now the option not to use that cache. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13679\">#13679</a></li>\n<li>A client connection could not detect whether it has been idle and hence the member was closing the connection. This is fixed now so that the member does not close the connections when the clients only listen. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13576\">#13576</a></li>\n<li>Fixed the <code>MultiMapValue</code> serialization error occurred when merging MultiMap entries. It was caused by firing MERGE events which expect the entry values to be serialized. Since MultiMap does not have a MERGE listener, there was no need to fire these events; this has been fixed and now no MERGE events are fired during the merging process. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13559\">#13559</a></li>\n<li>When a client is waiting for a lock to be released for a period more than invocation timeout seconds and the member dies, the client was getting an operation timeout exception. This behavior is fixed so that the operation is now retried on the new member of that lock. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13551\">#13551</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
