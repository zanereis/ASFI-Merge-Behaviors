method allows us to periodically extract perWorkerMetric updates for an input `MetricsContainerRegistry`. This is the same pattern we use to support existing DFE counters (see `StreamingStepMetricsContainer::extractMetricUpdates`).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR adds support to clean up stale PerWorkerCounters. Counters will be removed from the underlying `perWorkerCounters` map if they have been zero valued for longer than 5 minutes. This allows us to create counters with dynamic metric labels that might not last the lifetime of the job, e.g. BQ table IDs set with dynamic destinations.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

initial TestStream support for Prism for #29917.\r\n\r\n* Handles watermark advancement.\r\n* Multiple Outputs (though, this is untested until covered by Python, as Go doesn't permit tag specification, however, the same lookup mechanism remains in the single output case)\r\n* Handles arbitrary element bytes.\r\n* Handles being consumed as a side input.\r\n\r\nA bit of light experimentation on handling design puts most test stream related code into a single file, and uses an interface to delegate the execution of events to the different events themeselves.\r\n\r\nThe only easily testable logic outside of a pipeline execution context would be popping events from a queue. But as the alternative to correct popping is a pipeline freeze and crash (pending elements remaining, but nothing to trigger their processing), these are omitted.\r\n\r\nThe only included logic that isn't currently covered is Processing Time handling, though the core is present in this PR. TestStreams with ProcessingTime events will be hard failed at job submission time for now.  This is no great loss as Prism doesn't meaningfully handle ProcessingTime events at all, and that will require it's own coordination to insert their executions in the queue. Tracking processing time implementation is in #30083.\r\n\r\nThere was a bit of a delay in finishing this implementation due to the 2.54.0 beam release, and what to do about the Flink quirks. It turns out the Flink TestStream quirks were documented for the Go SDK, and the tests were made to suit them. This PR removes the quirks to validate What You Put In Is What You Get Out, for those tests (no extra length prefixing for example).\r\n\r\nPrism also wraps the unknown byte blobs with length prefixes if it is length prefixing that coder in other places. This is simpler than doing an additional conditional re-write of coders in the pipeline graph, just due to test stream. A test that uses a row coder has been added to additionally validate this behavior.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Also includes following two updates.\r\n\r\n* Add an annotation to upgraded transforms so that they can be easily identified by looking at the pipeline proto.\r\n* Prevent Dataflow from performing upgrading when building the Runner v1 pipeline (otherwise, Dataflow will unnecessarily start/shutdown the transform service twice).\r\n\r\nThis fixes

processing a CRLF-delimited file and the read buffer has CR as the last character, startOfNextRecord will be set to the position after the CR, i.e. the following LF. Let's say the position of this LF is p.\r\n\r\nIn the next buffer, even though the actual start of record should be p+1, startOfRecord is set to startOfNextRecord, which is p.\r\n\r\nThen the code processes the next record by skipping the LF and yields a record starting from p+1. It decides whether the record is valid by checking if startOfRecord is in the range defined in RangeTracker.\r\n\r\nIf there is a split right after p, i.e. we have ranges [a, p+1) and [p+1, b), then the above record would be considered as valid in the split [a, p+1), because its startOfRecord is p < p+1. However, the record is also considered valid when split [p+1, b) is processed, resulting into duplicated records in the output.\r\n\r\nfixes #29146\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Go SDK image to use distroless as the base image, instead of the docker debian image.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the same version of debian, but with everything but glibc stripped out of it.\r\n\r\nGo binaries (Go SDK binaries in particular) don't need external deps or most other parts of the OS toolchains, so this reduces the vulnerabilities to largely intractable to fix glibc issues. \r\n\r\nWe could remove glibc as by default the SDK doesn't need to compile with C-go enabled (the only reason to link in glibc for go running binaries) but it is handy for users who would depend on it.\r\n\r\ndistroless has the ca-certificates pre-installed, and as long as we build against latest, it remains relatively up to date. It's not clear to me why we chose to remove the licenses except when configured, but it's harder to remove things conditionally when the shell tools and bash aren't present.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

should make Java 17 available for java jobs to use without an extra download step. Then we can migrate them and remove Java 8 from the image. The goal is to build with gradle and plugins using this version of Java, and probably javac and all that also using this version but targeting Java 8 platform.\r\n\r\nFeedback welcome on the tradeoff between preloading this stuff onto the image vs downloading dynamically (as we seem to do for non-default versions), how to migrate to it being default, etc.\r\n\r\nParticularly I might eliminate the concept of it being symlinked to /usr/local/java and always use explicit versions when it comes to the filesystem layer.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

getProcessingDistributionsForWorkId threadsafe to avoid race conditions with remove tracker\r\n\r\nthe race condition happens in getProcessingDistributionsForWorkId because we check for the existence of the work id in the activeTrackersByWorkId map before retrieving the value from the map. if another thread removes the tracker from the map in-between us checking for its existence and actually grabbing the object, we will get a null tracker that then throws a NullPointerException when we try to access data on it. \r\n\r\nWas able to repro this with a chaos test locally and confirmed that synchronizing the getProcessingDistributionsForWorkId method solves the issue. Decided to not commit the chaos test since it's a bit messy and deviates from test patterns in this repo.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

(Within Beam's domain of course, since we don't have a way to measure external progress.) eg. We could track the progress at the last few ticks and only split if progress dips below our estimated progress.\r\n\r\nFixes #29180\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the Java Dataflow worker to send new ComputationHeartbeatRequests to Windmill if the experiment `send_new_heartbeat_requests` is set. If Windmill sends ComputationHeartbeatResponses, then the worker harness will mark any matching in-progress or queued work items as failed, which will cause the harness to abort processing as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWe check if the work item is failed:\r\n\r\n* In between reading elements from a source.\r\n* Before sending GetData or CommitWork requets.\r\n* When pulling a work item off the queue of active work.\r\n\r\nWe will also not send heartbeats for any failed work items. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
