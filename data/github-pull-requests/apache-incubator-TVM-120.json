DepthToConv operator to tensorflow frontend.\r\n\r\nIn some cases where a tensors shape was based on input values such as Resize or Full ops, Relay was unable to correctly determine the proper output shape. To address this, I added better constant detection to many operations. This allows more unusual architectures to be directly imported.\r\n\r\nAlso made keras import script work with tensorflow.keras if standalone keras not found.\r\n\r\nI've confirmed that frontend tests pass after these

a simple testing utility, @jroesch and I decided that it would be useful to have a translation of Relay programs into equivalent Python code that we could use as an oracle for fuzzing.\r\n\r\nHere I have written an attempt at such a translation. The Python code it produces is meant to match the intended semantics of Relay very closely rather than be performant, so there are some ineffeciencies that a smarter implementation could eliminate through analysis (translating let bindings as functions, for example).

This PR does this.\r\n\r\nAffected:\r\nWe could not use Auto TVM to tuning on ARM CPU. Because ARM CPU schedule only implement NCHW currently. We should add SpatialPack + NHWC for conv2d / depthwise convolution on ARM CPU.\r\n\r\n@srkreddy1238 \r\n\r\ncc: @songqun @gomida @ariwaranosai @tqchen @yzhliu

this PR has grown to include front-end support with Relay of VTA. Support for quantization, graph packing, and topi operator support are now grouped in this rather sizeable PR. In terms of operator coverage, group_conv2d and conv2d_transpose will be added in later PRs.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nCurrently a WIP PR. The goal here is to bring AutoTVM-compatible TOPI operators to VTA so we can leverage the autotuner to quickly search good schedules, instead of using the old scheduler that was ad-hoc and bug-prone.\r\n\r\nAdded the conv2d operator, but will be adding group_conv2d (for mobilenets variants), conv2d_transpose (for DCGAN), and dense for MLPs/RNNs.\r\n\r\nCredit for most of the AutoTVM support goes to @merrymercy; relay bitpacking to @jroesch and @MarisaKirisame who helped build the first prototype for Relay to VTA compilation.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-03T20:56:55Z","updated_at":"2019-11-04T17:33:41Z","closed_at":"2019-06-28T16:28:21Z","merged_at":"2019-06-28T16:28:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"3818b2a250543afad6d028d42dcd88033d4a7669","assignee":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Laurawly","id":3700467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDA0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3700467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly","html_url":"https://github.com/Laurawly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"Huyuwei","id":17470319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDcwMzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17470319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei","html_url":"https://github.com/Huyuwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

#3039 for the context and discussion.\r\n\r\nThis is my second cut at fixing tuple fusion, which I hope is a better approach than the rather ad hoc one in #3049 .\r\n\r\n* Added two new op patterns, for marking tuple and tuple field nodes \r\n* Added a new attribute to the fusion group structure, to keep track of data flow between groups (think hypergraph where nodes correspond to fusion groups)\r\n* After the existing fusion step, check each fusion group to see if we can further fuse the group and its input groups.  By now, we can determine If the tuple has been fused to subsequent ops or not. We can fuse tuple fields into the tuple here.

fixes #3072 \r\n\r\nCurrently bounding box for `fused` parameter in PassUpDomain is the full extent of `outer` and `inner` dimensions of the output tensor.\r\nProposed change computes tight bounds for `outer` dimension. If `fused` `IntSet` always fits inside `inner` dimension, then tight bound for `inner` also can be computed. Otherwise, full extent of `inner` is used.\r\n\r\nFor example, if 2 axes of a 2d tensor with shape (12, 6) are fused and split with factor 12, then outer and inner bounds will have dimension (2, 6). If the tensor is split with factor 9, bounds will be the same, because 9 elements wrap around 2 rows of (12, 6), and some redundant computation will occur. If split factor is 3, we can again avoid redundant computation by using (1, 3) shape.","created_at":"2019-04-22T21:38:14Z","updated_at":"2019-07-18T00:15:32Z","closed_at":"2019-07-18T00:15:10Z","merged_at":"2019-07-18T00:15:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"54f903a526d59e6701f5dc9a553f834ef45bc2ba","assignee":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

#3039 for the context. This is my take on fixing tuple fusion.\r\n\r\n* a tuple that is an intermediate value in its group can be fused. [The existing test case](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/tests/python/relay/test_pass_fuse_ops.py#L123) passes unmodified.\r\n\r\n* a tuple that is the root in its group is lifted out of a subfunction. Before this PR, the tuple is the return value of the subfunction\r\n\r\nHere is the approach:\r\n* First, tuples are marked as Injective so that they can be fused as much as possible.\r\n* After fusion step, chech if there are tuples that are roots in their groups\r\n* Update the data flow graph to detach root tuples from predecessors\r\n* Run DomTree construction and fusion step again. The tuples are no longer roots.\r\n\r\nPlease review @tqchen @zhiics @vinx13 @MarisaKirisame

and others have noted that the Peano (unary) nat, other than being a convenient example for ADTs, is not actually very useful outside of proof assistants and should be replaced with integer scalars.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes nats from the prelude and replaces them with integer scalars in other functions. Unfortunately, there appear to be issues with the interpreter that prevent the scalar operations from properly being lowered, so I have left this PR as a WIP until those issues can be fixed and allow the tests to work.

current Relay prelude is huge pain to modify and doesn't always result in correct ASTs requiring painful hand modifications each time we update it.\r\n\r\nIt would be far more useful to make use of the Relay parser to load the Prelude from disk.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it possible to partially load a Relay Prelude from disk. The PR also includes some modifications to the Relay parser to support defining more code in Relay.\r\n\r\nThis should help motivate one piece of the final push on the Relay Text format (see #3016).\r\n\r\nMy goal is to make it possible to define a limited form of TensorArray using this in the coming days.\r\n\r\ncc @wweic @joshpoll @MarisaKirisame
