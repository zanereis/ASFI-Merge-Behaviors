I additionally added TPCH's lineitem table as a new test dataSource for CalciteQueryTest. To avoid huge change, I added a simple annotation ```InputDataSource``` for unit tests based on CalciteTests indicating which data sources will be used in each unit test. The lineitem dataSource will be more useful to test various aspects of calcite.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n---\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\"

PR addresses #4746 . The idea is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. It is assumed that when a unzip/gunzip/copy from input stream happens it needs to skip the page cache (might need to be more fine-grained, need advice here)\r\n2. It reads and writes in chunks, in order ti impact the cache as little as possible: every chunk will shortly reside in memory and then gets flushed. This could be user configurable (how to?) or could be the same size as the segment size. If the latter it means that at most one segment that is being pulled will be in the cache for a bit. It would probably mean the same speed for pulling, but little impact on the  cache.\r\n\r\nThis is WIP: it doesn't address Azure/AWS/GCP stuff yet. As mentioned I need some advice in how to deal with when the unpacking gets called. Is this only used for pulling? Sometimes byteSources with retries are used and implemented differently. Should those also be updated?\r\n\r\ncc: @gianm @drcrallen

fixes #4016, #4177, #4812, #4781, #4743 and #5046 \r\nPartially fixes #4498 and #4693 \r\nAlternate to https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/4178 and https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/4175\r\n\r\n- Incrementally handoff segments when they hit maxRowsPerSegment limit\r\n- Decouple segment partitioning from Kafka partitioning, all records from consumed partitions go to a single druid segment\r\n- Support for restoring task on middle manager restarts by check pointing end offsets for segments\r\n- Incremental handoff is NOT supported with `pauseAfterRead` feature\r\n\r\nDesign - \r\n- Currently a KafkaIndexTask only creates and publishes segments corresponding to a single `sequenceName`.\r\n- With this PR, Introduced ability to incrementally hand-off segments by by starting a new sequence when `maxRowsInSegment` limit is reached and publishing all the segments for the previous sequence.\r\n- New Sequences are created by concatenating base sequence name with monotonically increasing id called `sequenceId`. It starts with 0.\r\n- A sequence corresponds to a range of Kafka offsets. `SequenceMetadata` class is added to `KafkaIndexTask` class to maintain metadata about a sequence. Metadata for all the sequences in the task is persisted to disk whenever a new sequence is created or deleted or end offsets for a sequence are set. This also enables restore on restart.\r\n- End offsets for the latest sequence is set whenever `AppenderatorDriverAddResult.getNumRowsInSegment()` returned by `add` call of `AppenderatorDriver` is greater than `maxRowsInMemory`. \r\n-At this point the task will pause and send `CheckPointDataSourceMetadataAction` to the Supervisor, which will use the same logic as is used for finishing all the tasks in the `TaskGroup` and call `setEndOffsets` on the replica tasks with `finish` flag set to `false` to indicate that current sequence should be finished and published and new sequence should be created for messages having offsets greater than the set end offsets. The new checkpoint information will be stored in the TaskGroup. \r\n- At Supervisor list of SequenceMetadata is not maintained for tasks in TaskGroup rather a sorted map of <SequenceId, Checkpoint> is maintained. Checkpoint always corresponds to the start offsets of a Sequence.\r\n- Whenever a new task is started by the Supervisor it always sends the map of checkpoints for the TaskGroup in the `context` field. Using this checkpoints information, the task creates list of SequenceMetadata and sets it start offsets to the start offset of the first sequence.\r\n- Since task always starts consuming from the start offset of first sequence, it is necessary for the Supervisor to remove checkpoints from the TaskGroup for which segments have been published so that new tasks are not sent stale checkpoints thus preventing duplicate work. \r\n- Supervisor does this clean up lazily only when it starts new tasks in replacement of a failed task or creates a new TaskGroup or discover new tasks for a TaskGroup (includes the case when it restarts). This is done by getting checkpoints information from the running tasks and verifying them with the offsets information in the metadata store. It also kills inconsistent task, refer to `verifyAndMergeCheckpoints` method.\r\n\r\nSome more information about specific issues -\r\n- Task status is set to `FINISHING` immediately after the task is asked to finish by call to `setEndOffsets` with `finish` set to `true` to fix https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/4812\r\n- To persist commit metadata only for the subset of segments which are being published, option 1 is used as described here - https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/4781\r\n- Un-deprecated `handoffConditionTimeout` property as for fixing https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/4175 the tasks are now killed (not stopped) after pending Completion Timeout elapses.\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-16T21:15:08Z","updated_at":"2018-10-18T20:54:50Z","closed_at":"2017-11-17T22:05:21Z","merged_at":"2017-11-17T22:05:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"cb03efeb147135440656149f119fdedb489b4a9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

followup to #4767\r\n\r\n@jihoonson i realized that after adding the exponential backoff ( https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/4767#discussion_r138473473 ) , wait can be up to two minutes which is very long for holding a thread in the executor and might starve sync with other good servers just because of a few bad servers when number of bad servers equals to number of threads available.\r\n\r\nthis patch is a fix to that, instead of holding the thread, schedule the next sync with delay equal to sleepMillis based on exponential backoff. so that no threads are actually blocked

is a one-line fix for `druid-kerberos` extension. There is a problem with class loader for hadoop `Configuration` class. By default, configuration uses the context class loader of the current thread set to the class loader used to load the application. But application class loader doesn't contain any dependencies due to isolation. As a result we can not load any class located in \r\n`hadoop-common` (it contains the most important implementations for configuring hadoop).\r\n\r\nThere are 2 solutions: use `Configuration` class loader or get class loader of any class in extension. I decided to use module class to make more explicit the fact that we use extension class loader.\r\n\r\nSome stacktrace for reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2017-09-07T13:16:58,928 INFO [main] io.druid.indexing.common.actions.RemoteTaskActionClient - Submitting action for task[index_hadoop_task_2017-09-07T13:16:52.833Z] to overlord[http://host:8090/druid/indexer/v1/action]: LockTryAcquireAction{interval=2017-08-09T00:00:00.000Z/2017-08-11T00:00:00.000Z}\r\n2017-09-07T13:16:59,011 ERROR [main] io.druid.cli.CliPeon - Error when starting up.

per [our conversation](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/druid-user/AATjuCUFS0E/36OIMaJjAAAJ) on the mailing list, I'm submitting a PR that changes the `RealtimePlumber` / `RealtimeIndexTask` to use the \"SegmentAllocate\" API.  Some notes:\r\n\r\nI refactored the \"segment tracking\" code out of `AppenderatorDriver` and in to a standalone class, `SegmentTracker` so that this can be reused.\r\n\r\nI struggled with the best way to add this in to the `Plumber` API given that the `RealtimePlumber` is used by both the `RealtimeIndexTask` and the `RealtimeManager` but it is instantiated in different scenarios.  I ended up passing the `SegmentAllocator` to `PlumberSchool#findPlumber` and passing the sequence name as an argument to `Plumber#add`.  I'm open to suggestions on ways to improve this but this seemed the best way, to me.\r\n\r\nIn `RealtimePlumber`, I'm using the task ID as the sequence name.  My understanding from reading the existing  code, particularly the `KafkaIndexTask`, is that the sequence name should be unique for the duration of the task.  Please correct me if my understanding is incorrect.  I'm not so certain about how to best generate a sequence name for the `RealtimeManager` though.  The test coverage here was pretty basic, and I don't have experience running realtime nodes, so I'm not sure if this is implemented properly.\r\n\r\nIn `RealtimePlumber`, I'm persisting the segment tracking metadata and the segments identifiers as JSON in files, similar to what is done to the identifier in `AppenderatorDriver`.  Please let me know if this is improper.  The other option would be to store them along with the index metadata but this didn't seem like the right place\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what feedback you have, thank you!","created_at":"2017-09-10T18:13:17Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:37:53Z","closed_at":"2018-02-07T16:50:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7c5a96874b8122bfe605c4101dc52aef57ac52ea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/4774/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/4774/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4774/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/5ef8fa5981003c45c2703cbeacc832a9eb08b847","head":{"label":"kevinconaway:realtime-segmentallocate","ref":"realtime-segmentallocate","sha":"5ef8fa5981003c45c2703cbeacc832a9eb08b847","user":{"login":"kevinconaway","id":6921953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjE5NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6921953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinconaway","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":102219499,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDIyMTk0OTk=","name":"druid","full_name":"kevinconaway/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kevinconaway","id":6921953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjE5NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6921953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinconaway","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinconaway/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kevinconaway/druid","description":"Column

for release notes:** downgrade from the Druid version, which includes this PR, is possible only to version, that includes #4824, i. e. Druid 0.11.0, but not earlier.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR consists of three sets of fairly independent changes:\r\n - Replace `IOPeon` with `SegmentWriteOutMedium`\r\n - Refactoring of buffer compression, remove unnecessary data copy\r\n - Replace some boxing collections with fastutil, and similar things in the serialization part of the codebase\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the way how those changes were developed doesn't allow to split them into independent PRs at this point and make them pass tests (I tried). I apologise for the size of this PR and will try to avoid this situation in the future.\r\n\r\n### Replace `IOPeon` with `SegmentWriteOutMedium`\r\n\r\n`IOPeon` interface was used in many serializers and writers to temporarily store the \"main volume\" of the data:\r\n```java\r\ninterface IOPeon {\r\n  OutputStream makeOutputStream(String filename);\r\n  InputStream makeInputStream(String filename);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere was a single implementation `TmpFileIOPeon`, that created a temporary file for each stream of data in the task working directory.\r\n\r\nThis interface is replaced with `SegmentWriteOutMedium`:\r\n```java\r\ninterface SegmentWriteOutMedium {\r\n  WriteOutBytes makeWriteOutBytes();\r\n}\r\n\r\nabstract class WriteOutBytes extends OutputStream implements WritableByteChannel {\r\n long size();\r\n void writeTo(WritableByteChannel channel);\r\n InputStream asInputStream();\r\n void readFully(long pos, ByteBuffer buffer);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`WriteOutBytes` is an abstraction of appendable byte stream, that is readable and writable at any time.\r\n\r\nThis interface change allowed to simplify many serializers and writers, and they don't need to be `Closeable` anymore.\r\n\r\nAlso an off-heap memory based implementation of `SegmentWriteOutMedium` is added, along with tmpFile-based. Everyone who have enough memory on the servers should use this type of `SegmentWriteOutMedium`. Note that it may require to change `-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize` JVM parameter.\r\n\r\nType of `SegmentWriteOutMedium` to use could be configured per-task (in this PR this is implemented for most relevant types of tasks, except Hadoop tasks), via a parameter called `segmentWriteOutMediumFactory`, with options `tmpFile` and `offHeapMemory`, somewhere in \"tuningConfig\".\r\n\r\nAlso a generic `druid.defaultSegmentWriteOutMediumFactory` configuration added, to select the `SegmentWriteOutMedium` to use for tasks in which `segmentWriteOutMediumFactory` is not specified. It should work in Hadoop as well. The default value is `tmpFile`, for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Refactoring of buffer compression, remove unnecessary data copy\r\n\r\nBuffer compression is simplified. Unnecessary data copy is removed at least at two points:\r\n - `CompressedObjectStrategy.toBytes()` (This method is removed and not used anymore, because the code that used it was optimized)\r\n - LZ4 compression now uses only direct buffers on the input and the output side, that allows the native implementation to not allocate another buffer internally and use the provided buffers.","created_at":"2017-09-08T00:01:32Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:37:52Z","closed_at":"2017-12-05T02:04:28Z","merged_at":"2017-12-05T02:04:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"a7a6a0487e22a4ca8975922d0127992789417103","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":120288359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAyODgzNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

now _Peon_ checks whether stdin is open, if it's not then _Peon_ shutdowns _JVM_. That way _Peon_ controls it doesn't lose the parent process. However it could be convenient to use _Peon_ within the same _JVM_ without open _stdin_. For example, a _Druid extension_ can send _Peon_ to a cluster managed by _Yarn/Mesos_ within a wrapper which uses _Peon_ functionality. This PR makes it possible to disable that check by using _Guice_ module

introduces lookup synchronization during startup of Druid processes. The main motivation for this is to cut the lookup load time when performed by the Coordinator, so that realtime tasks have lookups available immediately.\r\nUpon startup, processes communicate with the coordinator on retrieving the lookups to be loaded and loads them before finishing up the start sequence. Thus all the processes have the lookups loaded before starting to serve queries. If it fails to communicate with the coordinator (Coordinator unavailable) then it falls back to snapshot directory if there is any. \r\nThis does not fail startup of the process in case of failing to load lookups. Following are the high level changes:\r\n1. Add synchronization of lookups in LookupReferencesManager\r\n2. Parallelize the lookup loading process in LookupReferencesManager\r\n3. Move LookupReferencesManager and associated classes to druid-server module. This was necessary as LookupReferencesManager required access to LookupListeningAnnouncerConfig for tier related information and this was not possible from the druid-processing module.\r\n4. Introduce a flag which can be used to disable the lookup synchronization workflow on startup.","created_at":"2017-09-06T20:45:06Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:37:52Z","closed_at":"2017-10-13T02:22:24Z","merged_at":"2017-10-13T02:22:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"c07678b143663dde069569ab77c9803901d78a73","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":736877212,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzY4NzcyMTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Lookups","name":"Area

PR seeks to address a previously-encountered bug that if a `LoadRule` has multiple tiers, prolonged loading on a (lower) tier seems to \"block\" another tier from loading even when the latter is available for loading. Preliminary investigation suggests that, depending on the `BalancerStrategy` and/or configurations (e.g., `maxSegmentsInNodeLoadingQueue` and `replicationThrottleLimit`), the circumstances may result in missed opportunity in loading, which could critical when prompt loading in bulk is required (e.g., recovery of historicals).\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation, the primary replica will be assigned to the tier that comes first in the `tieredReplicants` map when there is no replica in the cluster and this replica _will not be throttled_: https://github.com/druid-io/druid/blob/d43687d578bf3dea98b01d0899bcfbb2125d142e/server/src/main/java/io/druid/server/coordinator/rules/LoadRule.java#L130-L134\r\n\r\nThe main mechanism in the PR uses the `priority` parameter set on the server to prioritized which server is selected as the holder of the primary replica. The change in this PR simply identifies if the primary replica needs to be loaded (i.e., when `totalReplicantsInCluster <= 0`) and will prioritize appropriately (i.e., select among the candidate servers the one with the highest priority), instead of using the arbitrary ordering of the hash

PR contains changes to improve handling of null values in druid by treating nulls as missing values which don’t actually exist. This will make it more compatible to SQL standard and help with integration with other existing BI systems which support ODBC/JDBC. (Detailed description in proposal - https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/4349)\r\n\r\nChanges include - \r\n\r\n## New Configuration \r\n\r\n* New configuration - **_\"druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull\"_** in class NullValueHandlingConfig default to true for preserving old behavior.\r\n* NullHandlingHelper - this a helper class with static methods for handling optional nullToEmpty / emptyToNull conversions for switching between old/new behavior. Without this static helper, we would need to inject NullValueHandlingConfig almost everywhere throughout the querying and indexing layer. \r\n\r\n## Storage Layer - \r\n\r\n* GenericIndexed - Added ability to distinguish between null/empty bytes. the value buffer for GenericIndexed contains element size followed by  the bytes, for null values size is written as -1 and for empty bytes size is 0. \r\n* String Columns - the dictionary is stores as a genericIndexed, which now can contain null value. An inverted index is created with the id assigned to null value. Null and empty strings will get different id's in dictionary encoding.\r\n* Numeric Columns - The column is serialized as primitive objects of long/float/double type, a nullRowsBitmap is also stored which is used to distinguish rows having 0 and null values.  \r\n* Complex columns - Complex columns use genericIndexed internally for storage, so supported nulls in genericIndexed make this work. the ObjectStrategy can choose to return null objects when deserializing data. \r\n\r\n## Indexing Layer - \r\n\r\n* Row - instead of returning primitive types return Float/Long/Double objects so that indexer can distinguish between null and 0 values.\r\n* StringIndexer,DoubleIndexer,LongIndexer,FloatIndexer changed to distinguish between null and empty values. \r\n* ColumnValueSelector - added new method isNull() to check whether a value is null or not while aggregating. this is mainly done in order to avoid boxing/unboxing from primitive values while doing segment scans. \r\n\r\n## Nullability for Aggregators/Metrics\r\n\r\nAs per the current implementation, most aggregators are coded to replace null values with default e.g. sum treats them as zeroes, min treats them as positive infinity, etc.\r\nTo match the new semantics and make aggregators nullable, where if an aggregator encounters only the null values the result will be null value following changes are made -\r\n\r\n* Aggrgator/BufferAggregator - Added a new method boolean isNull() which returns false by default. aggregators that support nullability can choose to override this and return true if the aggregated result is null. \r\n* Added a NullableAggregator/NullableBufferAggregator which is be used as a decorator for existing aggregator implementations to make them nullable. This will return null values if all the values aggregated are null, If any of the aggregated value is non-null, it will have same behavior as the delegate aggregator. \r\n* If new null behavior is enabled, aggregator factories will decorate the aggregators with NullableAggregator/NullableBufferAggregator. \r\n* Cardinality and HyperUnique  aggregators ignore null values and only count non-null values, If all the encountered values are null, the result will be 0. This is different from current behavior where null values are also counted.\r\n* Count aggregator - since count aggregator is not associated with any column and just a count of the number of rows, it has the same behavior as before. \r\n\r\n## Math Expressions Null Handling\r\n* For general calculations like sum, full expression is be considered as null if any of the components is null. \r\n* StringLiteral now supports null and and expressions containing non-quoted null is parsed as StringLiteral with null \r\n* Specifying a default value for null is supported by the use of NVL or IF clause to assign default values at query time.\r\n\r\n## Filtering on Null values\r\n* SelectorDimFilter currently specifies filtering on null values but the implementation assumes null and empty strings as equivalent. The implementation is changed to consider null and empty string differently. Generation of cache key for selectorDimFilter is also modified to support null.\r\n* InFilter/ExpressionFilter/LikeFilter are also modified to not treat nulls as empty strings. \r\n\r\n## Changes to Druid build-in SQL layer\r\n* NULL and empty strings are treated differently. \r\n* IS NULL and IS NOT NULL filters against null values instead of empty strings. \r\n* NVL, IFNULL and COALESCE work as per SQL standard. \r\n* count now skips null values and works as per SQL standard. \r\n\r\n## Misc Changes\r\n\r\nAbove are the major changes in the user facing APIs and behavior. Other than these there are multiple places in the code where we convert empty Strings to null and vice-versa. They are changed in order to treat null and String values separately.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility \r\n* **_\"druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull\"_** is added as a new config. The default value is set to true for backwards compatibility. \r\n*  code places in query/ingestion where we converted emptyToNull or nullToEmpty now use NullHandlingHelper which only does the conversion if backwards compatibility is enabled. \r\n* Storage layer changes are backwards compatible for GenericIndexed/String columns. \r\n* For Numeric columns new V2 serde implementations are introduced which also supports serde of nullRowsBitmaps. Previous implementations are kept unchanged to read any existing segments. \r\n\r\n## Testing \r\n* Most of the unit tests that tested nulls are modified to have two branches of expected results to test new/old behavior both. \r\n* For CI have added new runs to test matrix to test new behavior for nulls. \r\n* To run the tests with new behavior run **_\"-Ddruid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=false\"_**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-05T17:54:52Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:37:52Z","closed_at":"2018-01-22T18:51:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ff8484e5bf309c7fa34a468615b95cf09ba95e8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287687,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"2ceefb","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

support for JSON parse spec to the Avro parser. \r\n\r\nCurrently the Avro parser does not support nested fields and can only consume top level fields in an Avro record. This feature allows nested field support using a JSON Parse Spec. If an ingestion spec using an Avro Stream or Avro Hadoop parser contains a JSON parse spec then the extension will allow extraction of nested properties using the JSON parse spec / Flatten spec. \r\n\r\nThe implementation is basic and is probably lacking in some areas but I've created it to allow us to get off the ground without a lot of effort for a prototype. I've not documented this feature as did not think it was worth it until seeing if it would be pulled in. If it's of use to the community then I can document it via another commit. Alternatively if there is a better way of doing this without a lot of effort or I am fundamentally doing something wrong then let me know.\r\n\r\nBasically it works such that If the ingestion spec supplied is a JSON parse spec then at runtime a new Converter is used which essentially calls GenericRecord.toString to turn the GenericAvroRecord into JSON and passes this to the standard JSON parser to do it's dimension mapping. If any other type of parse spec is supplied then the existing implementation is used.\r\n\r\nSome of the important bits of code.\r\n\r\n- GenericRecordRowConverter \r\n```java\r\n  public MapBasedInputRow convert(GenericRecord record)\r\n  {\r\n    GenericRecordAsMap genericRecordAsMap = new GenericRecordAsMap(record, fromPigAvroStorage, false);\r\n    TimestampSpec timestampSpec = parseSpec.getTimestampSpec();\r\n    DateTime dateTime = timestampSpec.extractTimestamp(genericRecordAsMap);\r\n    return new MapBasedInputRow(dateTime, dimensions, genericRecordAsMap);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n- GenericRecordJSONConveter\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Override\r\n  public MapBasedInputRow convert(GenericRecord record)\r\n  {\r\n    Map<String, Object> map = parser.parse(record.toString()); //note the tostring\r\n    TimestampSpec timestampSpec = parseSpec.getTimestampSpec();\r\n    DateTime dateTime = timestampSpec.extractTimestamp(map);\r\n    return new MapBasedInputRow(dateTime, dimensions, map);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Factory method to instantiate correct converter based on spec type. \r\n```java\r\n  public static GenericRecordRowConverter fromParseSpec(\r\n      ParseSpec parseSpec,\r\n      boolean fromPigAvroStorage,\r\n      boolean binaryAsString\r\n  )\r\n  {\r\n    return parseSpec instanceof JSONParseSpec ?\r\n           new GenericRecordJSONRowConverter(parseSpec, fromPigAvroStorage) :\r\n           new GenericRecordRowConverter(parseSpec, fromPigAvroStorage, binaryAsString);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n- Example Spec.\r\n```java\r\n \"parser\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"avro_stream\",\r\n            \"parseSpec\": {\r\n              \"format\": \"json\",\r\n              \"timestampSpec\": {\r\n

depending upon the existing redirection feature and getLeader endpoint provided by them.\r\nHowever, to retain backward compatibility and to allow rolling upgrade, it first tries to find the coordinator or overlord node in external discovery which shall be removed in future. \r\n\r\nAll the other classes that used to interact with coordinator or overlord leaders have been updated to use

is fast implementation of CostBalancerStrategy. Computation algorithm slightly differs from the original version and allows pre-compute and cache cost function values to reduce complexity of the algorithm.\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\n 1. Current implementation is very complex computational task and calculation time grows linearly with number of segments in the cluster. For rather big cluster one druid balancer iteration could take tens of minutes\r\n 2. If large number of segments need to be rebalanced, cost function calculation could take hours or even days (if number of historical nodes changed for instance)\r\n 3. Total server cost could not be calculated due to high computational complexity and thus could not be included in balancing algorithm\r\n\r\nImplementation details:\r\n - Result numbers are not equal for CachingCostBalancerStrategy and CostBalancerStrategy, but decisions made are the same, meaning that the same server has been chosen for particular segment by two strategies (has been tested for ~100k segments from our cluster)\r\n - CachingCostBalancerStrategy is less memory efficient and requires ~100mb heap for each million of segments\r\n - Computation time is ~10000x faster (depends on segment distribution and total number of servers and segments)\r\n\r\nBenchmark\r\n\r\n```\r\ncachingCostStrategy  avgt   10      1.766 ±    0.035  us/op\r\ncostStrategy         avgt   10  21987.245 ±

support for JSON parse spec to the Avro parser. \r\n\r\nCurrently the Avro parser does not support nested fields and can only consume top level fields in an Avro record. This feature allows nested field support using a JSON Parse Spec. If an ingestion spec using an Avro Stream or Avro Hadoop parser contains a JSON parse spec then the extension will allow extraction of nested properties using the JSON parse spec / Flatten spec. \r\n\r\nThe implementation is pretty basic and is probably lacking in some areas but I've created it to allow us to get off the ground without a lot of effort for a prototype. I've not documented this feature as did not think it was worth it until seeing if it would be pulled in. If it's of use to the community then I can document it via another commit. Alternatively if there is a better way of doing this without a lot of effort or I am fundamentally doing something wrong then let me know.\r\n\r\nBasically it works such that If the ingestion spec supplied is a JSON parse spec then at runtime a new Converter is used which essentially calls GenericRecord.toString to turn the GenericAvroRecord into JSON and passes this to the standard JSON parse spec to do it's dimension mapping. If any other type of parse spec is supplied then the existing implementation is used instead.\r\n\r\nSome of the important bits of code.\r\n\r\n- GenericRecordRowConverter \r\n```java\r\n  public MapBasedInputRow convert(GenericRecord record)\r\n  {\r\n    GenericRecordAsMap genericRecordAsMap = new GenericRecordAsMap(record, fromPigAvroStorage, false);\r\n    TimestampSpec timestampSpec = parseSpec.getTimestampSpec();\r\n    DateTime dateTime = timestampSpec.extractTimestamp(genericRecordAsMap);\r\n    return new MapBasedInputRow(dateTime, dimensions, genericRecordAsMap);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n- GenericRecordJSONConveter\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Override\r\n  public MapBasedInputRow convert(GenericRecord record)\r\n  {\r\n    Map<String, Object> map = parser.parse(record.toString()); //note the tostring\r\n    TimestampSpec timestampSpec = parseSpec.getTimestampSpec();\r\n    DateTime dateTime = timestampSpec.extractTimestamp(map);\r\n    return new MapBasedInputRow(dateTime, dimensions, map);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Factory method to instantiate correct converter based on spec type. \r\n```java\r\n  public static GenericRecordRowConverter fromParseSpec(\r\n      ParseSpec parseSpec,\r\n      boolean fromPigAvroStorage,\r\n      boolean binaryAsString\r\n  )\r\n  {\r\n    return parseSpec instanceof JSONParseSpec ?\r\n           new GenericRecordJSONRowConverter(parseSpec, fromPigAvroStorage) :\r\n           new GenericRecordRowConverter(parseSpec, fromPigAvroStorage, binaryAsString);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n- Example Spec.\r\n```java\r\n \"parser\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"avro_stream\",\r\n            \"parseSpec\": {\r\n              \"format\": \"json\",\r\n              \"timestampSpec\": {\r\n

- Add `Offset.reset()`, which will allow to create ColumnValueSelectors/DimensionSelectors against a static `Offset` object (currently \"reset\" is done via `Offset` cloning and replacing the `Offset`

reference the offset directly (which is already a \"holder\" of primitive `int` offset value).

has two modes. Here is the doc from ConcurrentGrouper.\r\n\r\n> As long as the result set fits in memory, keys are partitioned between buffers based on their hash, and multiple threads can write into the same buffer. When it becomes clear that the result set does not fit in memory, the table switches to a mode where each thread gets its own buffer and its own spill files on disk.\r\n\r\nOnce the data are spilled on disk, records having the same grouping keys can be stored in different groupers and further aggregation is needed. Currently, this is combined by the single-threaded ```ResultMergeQueryRunner```, but it can be a problem if there are too many records to be combined.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, I added a combining tree at the last of ConcurrentGrouper which does streaming combine of records using multiple threads.
