of Collage, https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/0062-collage.md)\r\n\r\nThis change prepares the target handling machinery to support\r\n'external codegen' targets in addition to 'regular' targets. This allows us\r\nto configure the build with Collage as follows:\r\n```\r\n    host_target = tvm.target.Target(\"llvm\")\r\n    targets = [tvm.target.Target(\"cuda\", host_target),\r\n               tvm.target.Target(\"cutlass\", host_target),\r\n               tvm.target.Target(\"cudnn\", host_target)]\r\n    with tvm.transform.PassContext(...):\r\n        exe = tvm.relay.vm.compile(module, target=targets)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFour changes are required:\r\n1. I introduce four new target kinds for the external codegens currently supported\r\n   by Collage (\"tensorrt\", \"cutlass\", \"cudnn\" and \"cublas\"). Others can be added as\r\n   they are vetted for use by Collage. These are given a device type matching the\r\n   external codegen's assumption (ie just CUDA currently), and given a target kind\r\n   attribute \"is_external_codegen\" of True. The latter is needed by Collage to signal\r\n   the target kind name represents an external codegen 'compiler' name.\r\n2. I introduce the binary relation Target::IsExternalCodegenFor so that\r\n   'external codegen' targets can be related back to the 'regular' targets\r\n   they are implicitly using in their codegen.\r\n3. I rework the VMCompiler and BuildModule interfaces to accept an Array<Target> of\r\n   'raw targets' instead of a Map<Integer, Target>. This more general representation\r\n   is needed because we may now have multiple targets of the same device type\r\n   active simultaneously. I add new static methods on the Python Target to\r\n   convert to this form in a way that mimics check_and_update_host_consist.\r\n4. I rework CompilationConfig to work from Array<Target> directly, to not depend\r\n   on the host_target argument (since dealt with adequately on the Python side),\r\n   and to understand that if we have two targets for the same device type the\r\n   non-external codegen target takes precedence.\r\n\r\nThe change to CompilationConfig seems neutral with respect to the recent\r\ndiscussions on compilation configuration representation and tvmc.\r\n\r\nI've made sure to not expose CompilationConfig in any core APIs, preferring\r\nthe more neutral `Array<Target>` instead.\r\n\r\nI made a few attempts to remove Target.check_and_update_host_const entirely in\r\nfavor of using CompilationConfig as the definitive target handling choke point but\r\nbacked out each time due to difficulties supporting the existing Python code.","created_at":"2022-04-28T22:57:43Z","updated_at":"2022-05-05T00:58:33Z","closed_at":"2022-05-04T20:57:21Z","merged_at":"2022-05-04T20:57:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"521b80af217a60bf4be3febd5a1e081eb4f76b93","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11173/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11173/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11173/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/53a8aa715e595655dc9c1b99cfc69d27f3ad20e9","head":{"label":"mbs-octoml:mbs-collage-targets","ref":"mbs-collage-targets","sha":"53a8aa715e595655dc9c1b99cfc69d27f3ad20e9","user":{"login":"mbs-octoml","id":87091372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDkxMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87091372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":386444680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODY0NDQ2ODA=","name":"mbs-tvm","full_name":"mbs-octoml/mbs-tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mbs-octoml","id":87091372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDkxMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87091372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml/mbs-tvm","description":"Open

PR introduces a new interface to unify meta schedule logging from both c++ and python side. It will be easier to control logging level and format content. From now on, only task scheduler level will be printed to screen by default, and task level information will be logged to a file in given folder. We still support any logging configuration from outside, and use `tvm.meta_schedule` as the main logger.\r\n\r\nThe interface uses logger on the python side while on the c++ side we created a new macro called `TVM_PY_LOG` to work int the following style where `logging_func` is the optional packed function for logging (thanks to #10032 ):\r\n```\r\nTVM_PY_LOG(DEBUG, logging_func)\r\nTVM_PY_LOG(INFO, logging_func)\r\nTVM_PY_LOG(WARNING, logging_func)\r\nTVM_PY_LOG(ERROR, logging_func)\r\n```\r\nThe logger would fall back to original c++ logger function `LOG(Level)` if given logging function is not defined.\r\n\r\nRecomended setup of logger is as follows:\r\n```\r\nlogging.getLogger(\"tvm.meta_schedule\").setLevel(logging.INFO)\r\n# Use logging.DEBUG if debugging\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd further configuration of task level loggers can be set in `TuneConfig` for features like whether to stream to screen, whether to propagate to main logger, patterns, etc, by passing a Dict to `TuneConfig` as follows:\r\n```\r\nTuneConfig(\r\n    ...,\r\n    logger_config = {\r\n        \"loggers\": ...,\r\n        \"handlers\": ...,\r\n        \"formatters\": ...\r\n    }\r\n    # None if use default setting.\r\n    # The strings can be parameterized using any parameter given in create_loggers function\r\n    # for example, `{logger_name}` and `{log_dir}` can be used for parameterization in tune_extracted_tasks function.\r\n)\r\n```\r\nDefault setting is to output to files in `log_dir` folder and the logging structure looks like the following

`is_positive_int`, `is_negative_int`, `is_const_int`, and `as_const_int` had nearly duplicate type-checking logic.  This allowed handling of Broadcast nodes to be diverge between the implementations.  (e.g. `is_const_int(Broadcast(4,1), 4)` returns true, but `is_positive_int(Broadcast(4,1))` returns false.)\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `as_const_int` to contain the type-checking logic, including the handling of Broadcast nodes, with the other three functions implemented in terms of `as_const_int`.","created_at":"2022-04-26T14:42:21Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T13:59:00Z","closed_at":"2022-05-02T17:53:51Z","merged_at":"2022-05-02T17:53:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"169f824d69442ac9c19f320e2ddb9baec32af68e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11129/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11129/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11129/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/81de31acf486183ad4b88e9c745b8b13179ea596","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:op_h_deduplication","ref":"op_h_deduplication","sha":"81de31acf486183ad4b88e9c745b8b13179ea596","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

I have moved `device, cpu, cuda, gpu, opencl, cl, vulkan, metal, mtl, vpi, rocm, ext_dev` functions from `tvm.runtime.ndarray` to `tvm.runtime.devices` and reimported them in `tvm.runtime`, so we can

options would take effect at the TVM level, much like the LLVM codegen options take effect within LLVM. The current set of options is `emit-asm`, `emit-llvm`, `emit-obj`, and `emit-so`, and each one can take an optional value 0 or 1 (the default is 1). These options determine whether the particular type of output is generated, although options with any other use relevant to code generation (i.e. applicable in `BuildHexagon`) would be appropriate.\r\n\r\nRight now, the Hexagon codegen emits both the object code and the assembly text, which runs the LLVM codegen twice (extending compilation time). Even if the LLVM pass pipeline was constructed in a way to allow using different code emitters without repeating the codegen passes, it may still be useful to have control over whether the different types of output are generated or not. The primary motivation of this patch, though, is to reduce time spent in code generation.\r\n\r\nThere is a plan to change the `hexagon` target to become a variant of the `llvm` target, and this may serve as a use case for some additional options that may be added to `llvm`.\n\ncc

#9352 was merged, it became a requirement to pass runtime parameters to `tvm.build` in order for the RPC server to work. Most files were updated, but not `test_arduino_rpc_server.py`, as this test requires attached Arduino hardware.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a small change that fixes the test.

`src/runtime/hexagon`\r\n- delete directory `android`,\r\n- move files from `hexagon` to `.`, delete `hexagon`,\r\n- merge `host/hexagon_module.cc` with `hexagon_module.cc`, delete `host`.\r\n\r\nRename `HexagonHostModuleNode` to `HexagonModuleNode`.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nOne additional change in the contents of `HexagonModule` is that the list of functions with the \"C packed\" ABI is no longer needed and has been removed.  Functions that were offloaded to Hexagon could have had any number of parameters, and the interface would be created inside of TVM when the offloaded code was extracted into its own function.  Calls to these functions could not be generated by TVM at the same time, because the calls were placed in the host code, and were \"remote calls\", i.e. were calling the runtime to indicate what functions need to be called on Hexagon.  The actual \"call\" instructions were in the runtime, which needed to know what parameter-passing conventions was used: it would set up parameter register, stack, and execute a branch to the function code. Because of that, the list of functions following the \"C packed\" convention was also a member of the Hexagon module.\r\nWith the offload removed, there are no \"remote calls\" anymore, and the calling conventions are handled internally by LLVM.\r\n\r\ncc

on https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11075, add `MultiLevelTilingWithIntrin` schedule rule and `RewriteTensorize` postproc, which can be used for auto-tensorization with a single intrinsic, such as CPU / GPU dot product. This is the simplistic but non-trivial use of auto tensorization. \r\n\r\nThe diff looks large but most of them are boilerplate from tests. The actual change to enable auto tensorization is about 300 lines.\r\n\r\n`MultiLevelTilingWithIntrin` can be used to auto-tensorize schedules with the following intrinsics. We should be able to deprecate corresponding manual templates in AutoTVM, but detail perf analysis is yet to be done.\r\n* VNNI conv2d / dense\r\n* ARM NCHWc conv2d (with or without `sdot`) (cc @tkonolige)\r\n* `dp4a` for cuda, SPIRV integer dot product for vulkan, and AMDGPU gfx10 `sdot4` for rocm.\r\n\r\nAs a demonstration, I've add integration tests in `tests/python/integration/test_meta_schedule_auto_tensorize.py`, one of which is E2E auto-tensorzation on quantized `bert-base` x {VNNI, DP4A}. DP4A tests can also run on AMDGPU via vulkan or rocm backends (@mei-ye @tmoreau89).\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Siyuan Feng [Hzfengsy@sjtu.edu.cn](mailto:Hzfengsy@sjtu.edu.cn)\r\nCo-authored-by: Bohan Hou

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.21.0</h2>\n<h1>NumPy 1.21.0 Release Notes</h1>\n<p>The NumPy 1.21.0 release highlights are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>continued SIMD work covering more functions and platforms,</li>\n<li>initial work on the new dtype infrastructure and casting,</li>\n<li>universal2 wheels for Python 3.8 and Python 3.9 on Mac,</li>\n<li>improved documentation,</li>\n<li>improved annotations,</li>\n<li>new <code>PCG64DXSM</code> bitgenerator for random numbers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition there are the usual large number of bug fixes and other\nimprovements.</p>\n<p>The Python versions supported for this release are 3.7-3.9. Official\nsupport for Python 3.10 will be added when it is released.</p>\n<p>:warning:  Warning: there are unresolved problems compiling NumPy 1.21.0 with gcc-11.1 .</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimization level <code>-O3</code> results in many wrong warnings when running the tests.</li>\n<li>On some hardware NumPy will hang in an infinite loop.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New functions</h2>\n<h3>Add PCG64DXSM BitGenerator</h3>\n<p>Uses of the PCG64 BitGenerator in a massively-parallel context have\nbeen shown to have statistical weaknesses that were not apparent at the\nfirst release in numpy 1.17. Most users will never observe this weakness\nand are safe to continue to use PCG64. We have introduced a new\nPCG64DXSM BitGenerator that will eventually become the new default\nBitGenerator implementation used by <code>default_rng</code> in future releases.\nPCG64DXSM solves the statistical weakness while preserving the\nperformance and the features of PCG64.</p>\n<p>See <code>upgrading-pcg64</code> for more details.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18906\">gh-18906</a>)</p>\n<h2>Expired deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>shape</code> argument <code>numpy.unravel_index</code> cannot be\npassed as <code>dims</code> keyword argument anymore. (Was deprecated in NumPy\n1.16.)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

the Spresense SDK and `arduino-cli` had major bugs that required really nasty fixes in `base_box_provision.sh` (see https://github.com/sonydevworld/spresense/issues/200 and https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/pull/1312, respectively).\r\n\r\nBoth of these have been fixed in the latest versions, though. This PR updates the `arduino-cli` version to `0.21.1`, and sets the Spresense version to a generic latest version (as we do this for all the other board URLs). These allow us to remove the ugly hacks from `base_box_provision.sh`.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR requires merging #11043 and #11095.\n\ncc @gromero

add estimated roofline performance to a profiling report. The roofline model measures how close a operator gets to best possible memory bandwidth or FLOP/s depending on whether it is memory or compute bound. This computation uses the runtime of the operator along with two numbers extracted from the TIR code: bytes of memory touched and number of floating point operations. Because these numbers are extracted from TIR, they may not be 100% accurate. The best possible memory bandwidth and FLOP/s are measured by running small programs that are memory and compute bound respectively.\r\n\r\nFor now, this function only works with llvm cpu targets, but
