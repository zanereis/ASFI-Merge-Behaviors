this change sensors in \"reschedule\" mode were being instantly\nrescheduled because they didn't have the extra dep that\nBaseSensorOperator added.\n\nTo fix that we need to include deps in the

As of this PR right\nnow, only built-in deps are allowed -- a custom dep will result in a DAG\nparse error.\n\nWe can fix that for 2.0.x, as I think it is a _very_ uncommon thing to\ndo.\n\nFixes #12783\n\n\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!

have a number of custom forms that have required fields that weren't\nexplicitly marked as required.\n\nThis allowed you to submit the Connection form (for example) with\nnothing as the Conn Id, leading to an empty string being used as the\nconnection id. This marks that and all the other required fields as\nrequired.\n\nWe also replace DataRequired with InputRequired. The previous one is\ntested the truthyness of the value, rather than just that a value was\nsubmitted.\n\n\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!

#12757 \r\n\r\nWhen a task does not have a dag at the time it's being set as a relative of another task, the Graph View becomes empty.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow import

It's added to op1's DAG after this line, but not added to any `TaskGroup`.

On several occasions we've seen someone introduce an error in a couple hundred generated DAGs, which completely clobbers the web UI. \r\n\r\nMy initial plan was to introduce a separate view for import errors, and allow users to disable the import errors on the main page via configuration. However, now that Airflow 2 makes this section of the page collapsible, I figured its easier to just make this section collapsed by default.

configuring airflow to use smtp_backend for outbound email alerts(using `email_on_failure` or `email_on_retry`), from time to time, airflow isn't able to reach the SMTP server and by default `smtplib` does not enforce a timeout. This leads to the airflow task just stalling indefinitely and not terminating.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces 2 new `[smtp]` config parameters:\r\n `smtp_timeout` : To enforce a timeout when making the initial smtp call using `smtplib`. This defaults to 30 seconds.\r\n `smtp_retry_limit`: Number of retries for the email sending mechanism. This defaults to 5 retries.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/12576\r\n\r\n- Fix the log spam issue reported in https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/12576 . It's easy to validate the issue\r\n```python\r\nimport docker\r\ncli = docker.APIClient()\r\nfor x in cli.pull(self.image, stream=True, decode=True):\r\n    print(x)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The change in this PR actually also makes the log more meaningful. When we pull an image, normally there are a few layers, simply printing the `status` is not very meaningful. It's much better to print the `status` by `id`.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Sample output when we pull image using `docker.APIClient.pull(stream=True)`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/100925266-1258e100-34e2-11eb-9930-3c31e25baaa0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
