For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-2301\\] Sync files of an S3 key with a GCS path\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2301\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n    - Sync all files in an S3 key with a Google Cloud Storage path with or without replacement. Google Cloud Platform offers a transfer service but it lacks retrials and the advantages of making the transfer dependent on certain events as in what can be done with a DAG. This operator makes all that possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n   - `tests/contrib/operators/test_s3_to_gcs_operator.py`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-12T10:17:47Z","updated_at":"2018-04-13T07:33:45Z","closed_at":"2018-04-13T07:33:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9df4bb2ff94994ac3de5f48a4d93aa050fc9ba95","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3216/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3216/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3216/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/a8507e0ae3ba636e0249d5c1c955e75c0a42bf5c","head":{"label":"wileeam:s3-to-gcs-operator","ref":"s3-to-gcs-operator","sha":"a8507e0ae3ba636e0249d5c1c955e75c0a42bf5c","user":{"login":"wileeam","id":275724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NTcyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/275724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wileeam","html_url":"https://github.com/wileeam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wileeam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wileeam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wileeam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wileeam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wileeam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wileeam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wileeam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wileeam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wileeam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"5cb530b455be54e6b58eae19c8c10ef8f5cf955d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1325) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1325\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n- Add ElasticSearch log handler which writes to local file and reads from ElasticSearch (need seperate EFK/ELK stack to have the local file uploaded to ElasticSearch).\r\n- Add support of auto-tailing task instance log, when user scroll to the bottom.\r\n- Log reading major changes:\r\n    - No log will be loaded before rendering ti_log.html, instead the html will make calls, potentially repeatedly, to new get_logs_with_metadata() endpoint to load logs (see the graphs below).\r\n    - FileTaskHandler().read() would now take metadata as an option parameter to enable streaming read and return (logs, metadatas) tuple, which may contain end of log and next offset info.\r\n\r\nNote that codes under /tests/utils/log/elasticmock are mostly copy/paste from ElasticMock with some compatibility changes and License headers added.\r\n\r\nA simple high level overview of the architecture change of the task instance log loading:\r\n![old_arch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/37805787-96ee0186-2df9-11e8-96e0-6dfcb71bd1bd.jpg)\r\n![new_arch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/37805791-98d4525c-2df9-11e8-8f3b-ddf3a3ed2d65.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn the new architecture, metadata would be used to mark end of log, current offset in stream, etc.\r\n\r\nHere are some screenshot for the new loading icon, which will be displayed as long as the task log page is still loading log (e.g. loading large log or loading streaming log):\r\n<img width=\"1668\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-04-12 at 12 52 07 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/38663786-aca32f4e-3dec-11e8-9811-33ea88e2d7d2.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1671\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-04-12 at 12 59 53 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/38663850-df743026-3dec-11e8-98fb-c9952b4c6684.png\">\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntests/utils/log/test_es_task_handler.py\r\ntests/www/test_views.py: test_get_logs_with_metadata\r\n\r\nSimilar logic has been running in our branch for more than half a year. Tested Elasticsearch as logging backend on our cluster end to end.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-2314\\] Remove only leading slash in GCS path\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2314\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n    - This PR resolves an unwanted behaviour of the `_parse_gcs_url` function in `airflow.contrib.hooks.gcs_hook` that strips both the leading and trailing slash characters in the blob part of the URI, to *only* keep the stripping leading character (if available).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n    - `tests/contrib/hooks/test_gcs_hook.py`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2307\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCloses AIRFLOW-2307.  Adds uid to task instance, opportunistically set uid if an id is returned from execute_async.  Returns task id from CeleryExecutor.   This should be generally applicable to other executors with a little work.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nCovered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-10T19:23:20Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T16:27:07Z","closed_at":"2019-09-11T16:27:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"69c58657ff27cbc35190bc1880074851158b1eae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2278\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n> When you need to make some minor changes in your DAG would be nice to have possibility to edit it from webapp.\r\n> To protect DAG from editing by everyone should be set up arg inside DAG 'editable_by'. Where '*' means everyone, and ['user1', 'user2'] means specific users.\r\n> Example when DAG can be editable in webapp by user1 and user2 only:\r\n```\r\nargs = {\r\n'owner': 'airflow',\r\n'editable_by': ['user1', 'user2'],\r\n'start_date': airflow.utils.dates.days_ago(2)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd with access you will get:\r\n![airflow-dag-edit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4667951/38294690-efbe761e-37eb-11e8-9541-26ef63bf790b.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n> My change is simple and related most of all to front-end part\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n>

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2162\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWhen impersonating a user other than the user the executor is running as, sudo is pre-pended to the commands.  Without -E arg, the env variables are lost.  This can affect running in docker containers, etc.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTrivial 1-line change already covered in tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

data is ordered by first column in descending order\r\nHeader row comes as first only if the first column is number\r\nThis fix puts header as first row regardless of first column data type\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2254\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn RedshiftToS3Operator, data was ordered by first column in descending order. Header row comes as first only if the first column is number. Additional column called sort order is used to order the rows such that header row is always comes first in the file regardless of first column data type. This additional column is used only for sorting and not part of the output\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTestRedshiftToS3Transfer - Updated test case to reflect the change \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [ x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2261\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWith this change, one should be able to enable remote log storage via `REMOTE_BASE_LOG_FOLDER`, `REMOTE_LOGGING`, and `REMOTE_LOG_CONN_ID` in either the config file or environment variables.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThe change is fairly minor.  Plus, I'm not sure how automated testing is set up for this (e.g. mock remote destinations)--update me and I'll add one.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4.

PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n> - [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nUpdate the \"allowed_formats\" in bigquery_operator.py to allow files of format PARQUET.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n> I followed the instructions in the contributor guidelines and was prepared to add tests, however my change is a very simple set of additions to whitelists restricting what file types may be imported into BigQuery. It would seem that according to these testing guidelines, there ought to be tests for this, however there are none, and so I'm assuming there are good reasons for this that are not immediately obvious to me. I'm submitting this PR on the basis of this reasoning, however I am happy to take feedback and reconsider this.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n X   1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n X   2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n X   3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n X   4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n X   5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n X   6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n\r\n> This runs and exits-zero.\r\n\r\nAdditional Note: I have run several Parquet-to-BQ jobs using this code, which have

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA-2256](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2256) issues\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2256\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] The SparkOperator did not support submits to a standalone cluster in client mode. When submitting to a standalone cluster, network failures/timeouts are common. Therefore a retry mechanism has been added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2253\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWe are trying to improve user experience on Airflow particularly on Airflow CLI where our user does most of testing in CLI. As a first step, we'd like to instrument user's activity on CLI.\r\nCurrently, Airflow instruments user activity from web UI via www.utils.action_logger, but not on CLI and we are trying to instrument user activity from Airflow CLI as well. By default, we'd like to instrument same as what current behavior from Web UI.\r\nShould it need different instrumentation, we will provide a registry method to register callback so that customized instrument can be easily plugged in. (e.g: We have our customized event topic that already wired with ingestion pipeline. Having pluggable callback, making integration with customized instrumentation a breeze.)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2247\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nRedshiftToS3Transfer calls S3Hook.get_credentials() and tries\r\nto take the return value as a tuple with two elements but fails.\r\nThis is because the return value is ReadOnlyCredentials, which\r\nshould be handled as a single object or a tuple with tree elements.\r\nThis PR fixes the above problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNewly added tests/operators/test_redshift_to_s3_operator.py.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

for reviewing. This is my first PR for apache/incubator-airflow. Please let me know if there are any issues. I welcome all feedback and comments.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2249) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdding side-loading param to the Zendesk Hook to allow support for the side-loading capability in the Zendesk API. Side-loading allows for the retrieval of related records as part of a single request. Currently, the Zendesk hook does not support side-loading and only returns data related to a primary key. See https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/core/side_loading for correct usage of side-loading and valid side-loading parameters for various endpoints.\r\n\r\nThe side-loading param is a boolean which denotes whether a user intends to side-load additional data in his/her API request. When marked as true, the Zendesk Hook call returns a dictionary of dictionaries with key/values of the primary/side-loaded params as the keys and dictionaries of the corresponding data as the values.  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI have added the `test_zdesk_sideloading_works_correctly` function to the `test/contrib/hooks/test_zendesk_hook.py` file to ensure that the added functionality works as intended.\r\nAdditionally the other tests in the file still pass without any extra modifications (aside from small pep8 changes that I included to make sure my test file was pep8 compliant)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-23T20:18:18Z","updated_at":"2018-03-26T19:25:24Z","closed_at":"2018-03-26T19:25:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"788b5e89a73313fb25d2a0aaf066a821d326381b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3153/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3153/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3153/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/a006f721081e8e96655dd278bc809bfd406b79de","head":{"label":"theodoresiu:zendesk_sideloading","ref":"zendesk_sideloading","sha":"a006f721081e8e96655dd278bc809bfd406b79de","user":{"login":"theodoresiu","id":12432513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDMyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12432513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu","html_url":"https://github.com/theodoresiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":126498197,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjY0OTgxOTc=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"theodoresiu/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"theodoresiu","id":12432513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDMyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12432513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu","html_url":"https://github.com/theodoresiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theodoresiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/theodoresiu/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

For example, \"[AIRFLOW-1929] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1929\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe TriggerDagRunOperator was not configurable to pass the execution_date of the dag being triggered. This change adds another field to the TriggerDagRunOperator and uses the experimental API method trigger_dag used in the cli utility. This can help in avoiding code deduplication. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nHave modified the existing test cases to encompass the new changes.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2200) \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] This pull request adds a [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.net/) connection, hook, and operator so that Airflow can execute Snowflake operations. A snowflake entry has been added to the list of possible connections:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9574117/37796203-16fec232-2ded-11e8-942f-99292f989c5c.png)\r\nso we can store the connection details using Airflow's encryption:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9574117/37796281-47858a08-2ded-11e8-83ad-09d7b23d9cf3.png)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR doesn't have any tests because it depends on snowflake credentials. Let me know if there is a work around or example for this. It follows the same patterns as the mysql and postgres hooks/operators. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-22T20:46:26Z","updated_at":"2018-04-09T14:38:30Z","closed_at":"2018-04-05T07:28:42Z","merged_at":"2018-04-05T07:28:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"c4ba1051a750cd0a0906eba652bc21e848aa8454","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3150/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3150/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3150/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c4ba1051a750cd0a0906eba652bc21e848aa8454","head":{"label":"xl8:AIRFLOW-2200","ref":"AIRFLOW-2200","sha":"c4ba1051a750cd0a0906eba652bc21e848aa8454","user":{"login":"xl8","id":5823440,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU4MjM0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5823440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xl8","html_url":"https://github.com/xl8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xl8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xl8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xl8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xl8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xl8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xl8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xl8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xl8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xl8/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"9c0c4264c3ecdee2d11c0be9d2a151ea423dd3d9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2228) \r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2228\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n1. Allow tolerance to take on a value of 1. This is important to define a range of values the results can take on. \r\n   Modify the condition r / (1 + self.tol) <= self.pass_value <= r / (1 - self.tol) in ValueCheck operator\r\n to  pass_value_conv * (1 - self.tol) <= r <= pass_value_conv * (1 + self.tol)\r\n2. Modify pass_value to be a template field, so that it's value can be determined at the runtime. Convert the pass_value to float if possible in the execute method itself, after the template has been rendered.\r\n3. Add the tolerance value in the airflow exception. This gives an idea about the allowed range for the resultant records.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests\r\nAdded 4 unit tests in ValueCheckOperatorTest to check the following: \r\n1. Rendering of pass_value field when it's value is of type string.\r\n2. Pass value accepts a float value even after though it's a template field.\r\n3. No exception is raised when the record is within the allowed range. \r\n4. An exception is raised when the record > 2*pass_value and tolerance is set to 1. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`","created_at":"2018-03-22T09:41:24Z","updated_at":"2018-03-26T19:16:24Z","closed_at":"2018-03-26T19:16:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"000a738b495f5055b6ad2c49fdd087c71e84fd2c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3149/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3149/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3149/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/96d769b04edb71d2a11b1cf30cadbfb892e9bf78","head":{"label":"sakshi2894:AIRFLOW-2228","ref":"AIRFLOW-2228","sha":"96d769b04edb71d2a11b1cf30cadbfb892e9bf78","user":{"login":"sakshi2894","id":15192680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTkyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15192680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894","html_url":"https://github.com/sakshi2894","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":125063512,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjUwNjM1MTI=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"sakshi2894/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sakshi2894","id":15192680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTkyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15192680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894","html_url":"https://github.com/sakshi2894","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakshi2894/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sakshi2894/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

JIRA\r\n- [ X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1235\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis catches the condition where gunicorn master process exits (usually due to a problem starting workers, e.g. SQL unavailable), but airflow isn't aware and the webserver just keeps running.  This change will not leave airflow webserver in a hung state. It should crash all the way out, so that systemd/supervisord/docker/whatever init system can restart it.\r\n\r\nThis is a partial fix so we should not close out the Issue. We need to fix the underlying condition and make the airflow www app more robust (perhaps some retries) and potentially consider restarting gunicorn if it crashes.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThis is a trivial change. The positive case is already covered in test coverage. I'm not totally sure how to cover the negative case (e.g. gunicorn dies).  Mocking?\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [X ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2224) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdds support to export files in CSV format, including all traditional CSV formatting options\r\n * Column names in first row\r\n * Delimiter selection\r\n * Quote character selection\r\n * Character escape selection\r\n * Line termination character selection\r\n\r\nUses unicodecsv to handle all CSV formatting nuances.\r\nDone through adding an additional parameter 'export_format' that defaults to 'json' (for retro-compatibility).\r\nParameter is a dictionary with muliple key-value pairs, see component documentation for details.\r\nCSV file format is also split into multiple parts (as JSON).\r\nCorrect mime type 'application/csv' set when uploading to GCS.\r\nHeader is included in all parts (if muliple parts required).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTests for mysql_to_gcs added, based on existing tests for postgres_to_gcs. Added additional test to verify new CSV file export functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

DagBag to prepare the possibility of fetching dags remotely, by creating the DagFetcher abstraction, and a factory function that instantiates the right DagFetcher based on the _dags_folder_ URI prefix.\r\n\r\nImplements the default FileSystemDagFetcher (using the code that was part of DagBag).\r\n\r\nAdds the possibility of adding DagFetchers as plugins.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [AIRFLOW-2221](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2221) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] This PR refactors DagBag to prepare the implementation of multiple DagFetchers. It is not supposed to bring new functionality, but it is also not supposed to break anything :)\r\nBecause the file system related code from DagBag was moved to FileSystemDagFetcher, the diff is bigger than the actual changes. Is is basically:\r\n* A DagFetcher abstract base class.\r\n* A FileSystemDagFetcher, where the code is what we already had scattered in the DagBag class.\r\n* A get_dag_fetcher factory method that instantiates the right fetcher based on the dags_folder setting scheme (the uri prefix).\r\n* DagBag instances initialize and hold their own dag_fetcher (but always use the default for the example_dags).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\nAdded test_get_dag_fetcher in tests.models:DagBagTest\r\nRemoved test_get_dag_without_refresh as I didn't find an easy way to implement this test under the new architecture.\r\nAdded test_fetchers in test.plugins_manager:PluginsTest\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-18T01:00:56Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T13:02:11Z","closed_at":"2018-12-27T09:24:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6330d58633c3645c523d97b0bd45f8312e50e747","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1460\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen a task instance exists in the database but its corresponding task\r\nno longer exists in the DAG, the scheduler marks the task instance as\r\n`REMOVED`. Once removed, task instances stayed removed forever, even if\r\nthe task were to be added back to the DAG.\r\n\r\nThis change allows for the restoration of removed task instances. If a\r\ntask instance is in state `REMOVED` but the corresponding task is present\r\nin the DAG, restore the task instance by setting its state to `NONE`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nA new unit test in ` tests/models.py` simulates the removal and restoration of a task\r\nfrom a DAG and verifies that the task instance is restored. Run it with:\r\n`./run_unit_tests.sh tests.models:DagRunTest.test_removed_task_instances_can_be_restored`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

all,\r\nThis PR is to add the Slack webhook hook/operator pair. This allows posting\r\nmessages to Slack in an easy, light-weight manner. It requires a lot less configuration than the full Slack API. We've been using it to post messages if a task fails. \r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [AIRFLOW-2217](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2217/) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2217\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n       Add the Slack webhook operator/pair, which allows for easier, simple interaction with Slack. The    incoming webhook supports posting messages to a specified channel. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: Adds tests for both the slack_webhook_hook and slack_webhook_operator\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-15T08:04:52Z","updated_at":"2018-03-28T21:24:39Z","closed_at":"2018-03-28T21:24:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4560206b9a4cc95e6fe80568f5bf72620f73a8a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3129/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3129/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3129/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/2dcbcb659fb7afbf808a487413a936bbfa74469a","head":{"label":"danielvdende:AIRFLOW-2217-add-slack-webhook-operator","ref":"AIRFLOW-2217-add-slack-webhook-operator","sha":"2dcbcb659fb7afbf808a487413a936bbfa74469a","user":{"login":"danielvdende","id":4234426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzQ0MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4234426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende","html_url":"https://github.com/danielvdende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62139910,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjEzOTkxMA==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"danielvdende/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"danielvdende","id":4234426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzQ0MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4234426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende","html_url":"https://github.com/danielvdende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielvdende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/danielvdende/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2207\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\ntests.www.test_views:TestMountPoint.test_mount changes base_url\r\nthen calls airflow.www.app.cached_app().\r\nBut if another test calls app.cached_app() first without changing\r\nbase_url, succeeding test_mount fails on Travis.\r\nSo test_mount should clear cached app for itself in its setup method\r\nso as to remount base_url forcefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis PR does not need a new test, because it's a fix for existing test case. I ran `run_unit_tests.sh tests.www.test_views` with another test case that calls app.cached_app() and confirmed both of them succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-12T14:53:44Z","updated_at":"2018-03-12T18:06:10Z","closed_at":"2018-03-12T18:06:10Z","merged_at":"2018-03-12T18:06:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"7ab53e6f3d12d36a9828ad6facc25598652b1023","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3123/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3123/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3123/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/7ab53e6f3d12d36a9828ad6facc25598652b1023","head":{"label":"sekikn:AIRFLOW-2207","ref":"AIRFLOW-2207","sha":"7ab53e6f3d12d36a9828ad6facc25598652b1023","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59171319,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTE3MTMxOQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"sekikn/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn/airflow","description":"Apache

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2204) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe command `airflow webserver -d` crashes because it tries to call the method run from the `cached_app` (from `airflow.www.app`) returned value, i.e. a `DispatcherMiddleware` instance. To run the flask app in debug mode (without gunicorn) it has to be created directly via `create_app` (also from `airflow.www.app`), that returns the Flask instance.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nVery small changes, just a variable assign pushed a few lines down the usual flow and a line added for the debug flow. \r\n(Some are to fix PEP8 compliance and pass `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-10T01:26:05Z","updated_at":"2018-03-12T18:08:56Z","closed_at":"2018-03-12T18:08:56Z","merged_at":"2018-03-12T18:08:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"022b7ae3f3c6492f1188c5bcd28a65fc0222ee5a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3118/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3118/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3118/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/022b7ae3f3c6492f1188c5bcd28a65fc0222ee5a","head":{"label":"bbonagura9:master","ref":"master","sha":"022b7ae3f3c6492f1188c5bcd28a65fc0222ee5a","user":{"login":"bbonagura9","id":1745946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDU5NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1745946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9","html_url":"https://github.com/bbonagura9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113681464,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTM2ODE0NjQ=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"bbonagura9/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bbonagura9","id":1745946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDU5NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1745946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9","html_url":"https://github.com/bbonagura9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbonagura9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bbonagura9/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

more manual tests pending, also need to make it python3 compatible to pass CI**\r\n\r\nAdding back support for filter in max_partition().\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2202) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2202\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAdding back support for filter in max_partition() which could be used by some valid use cases. It will work for tables with multiple partitions, which is the behavior before (tho the doc stated it only works for single partitioned table). This change also kept the behavior when trying to get max partition on a sub-partitioned table without supplying filter--it will return the max partition value of the partition key even it is not unique.\r\n\r\nSome extra checks are added to provide more meaningful exception messages.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded test_hive_hook.py to test _get_max_partition_from_part_names(). Also tested on our local branch.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-09T09:05:28Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T21:13:11Z","closed_at":"2018-03-17T01:03:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0c1d03f50bf55ca0f602cb21964e2b19255c9152","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3117/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3117/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3117/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/3d18aac4534051e49cd4fe9a0af375b73203836c","head":{"label":"KevinYang21:kevin_yang_add_filter","ref":"kevin_yang_add_filter","sha":"3d18aac4534051e49cd4fe9a0af375b73203836c","user":{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":106481430,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDY0ODE0MzA=","name":"airflow","full_name":"KevinYang21/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21/airflow","description":"Apache
