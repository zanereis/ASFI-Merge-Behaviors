call to `backingStore.get()` (called by connector task threads through `OffsetStorageReaderImpl.offsets()`) can block for long time waiting for data flush to complete (`KafkaProducer.flush()`).\r\n\r\nThis change moves that call outside the synchronized clause that holds `offsetReadFutures`, so that if `backingStore.get()` hangs then it does not keep `offsetReadFutures` locked. The access to `closed` flag (`closed.get()`) is kept inside the synchronize clause to avoid race condition with `close()`.\r\n\r\nThis is important because `OffsetStorageReaderImpl.close()` needs to lock `offsetReadFutures` as well in order to cancel the futures.\r\nSince the herder thread calls `OffsetStorageReaderImpl.close()` when attempting to stops a task, before this change this was resulting in the herder thread hanging indefinetely waiting for `backingStore.get()` to complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

removes `transaction-coordinator` as a dependency of `storage`. This prevented making `transaction-coordinator` depend on `coordinator-common` because `coordinator-common` itself depends on `storage` thus making a loop. `transaction-coordinator` was only used in `storage` tests to get one constant.\r\n\r\nThe new Serde, `TransactionCoordinatorRecordSerde`, mimics `GroupCoordinatorRecordSerde` and is also used in `DumpLogSegments` instead of `TransactionLog`. Following this PR, we will now be able to move `DumpLogSegments` to `tools` as `TransactionLog` was the last class it depended onto from `core`.\r\n\r\nWe should be able to refactor `TransactionLog` to use `TransactionCoordinatorRecordSerde`, or even completely replace it.

consumer supports auto.offset.reset config option, which is used when there is no initial offset in Kafka (or) if the current offset does not exist any more on the server. This config currently supports earliest/latest/none options. Currently consumer resets might force applications to reprocess large amounts of data from earlier offsets. With infinite storage, its beneficial to have a duration based offset reset strategy. This will allow applications to consume/initialise from a fixed duration when there is no initial offset in Kafka.\r\n\r\nAs part of [KIP-932](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-932%3A+Queues+for+Kafka), we are adding support for share consumer groups. Share consumer groups supports dynamic group configuration property share.auto.offset.reset. This is used to set the initial Share-Partition Start Offset (SPSO) based on the share.auto.offset.reset configuration. Currently share.auto.offset.reset supports earliest and latest options to automatically reset the offset\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Kafka Consumer, we will add support for by_duration:<duration> config value for `share.auto.offset.reset`.\r\n\r\n\r\n>from [KIP-1106](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-1106%3A+Add+duration+based+offset+reset+option+for+consumer+clients)\r\n\r\nSome
