Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1633] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1633\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n- The issue is that when [CompactionCompleteFileOperationAction.java](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3494/files#diff-1cff14b642342f6005b830c658cae9c6030148c9c79cf3a914d9acac57f3c644) succeeds , it persists the init time using the key `CompactionSlaEventHelper.LAST_RUN_START_TIME`. However, if the job fails after this point but before metadata registration, then the files will not be registered until the next re-compaction cycle determined by `compaction.timebased.min.recompaction.duration`. \r\n- Note: This value for the `CompactionSlaEventHelper.LAST_RUN_START_TIME` is used by the [CompactionTimeRangeVerifier.java](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3494/files#diff-e35a620545631e579301d1d49744d2465729932480c4f9de8eecc0375962b77b) to determine when the last successful compaction started and whether to proceed with recompaction.\r\n- The solution is to persist the value for the key `CompactionSlaEventHelper.LAST_RUN_START_TIME` after the MR compaction task has completed instead of after the file operation is completed. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is extremely difficult to add tests to the MR Compaction Task due to the tight coupling with the job submission. I have regression tested this using a parallel test pipeline and compacting twice.\r\n\r\nThe first compaction job successfully compacts the hourly partition to a daily partition, and the second compaction job does not create any work units due to the compaction\r\n```\r\n26-04-2022 11:07:37 PDT daily-compaction-orc INFO - WARN Last compaction for /data/tracking/streaming_parallel_test/PageViewEvent/hourly/2022/04/26 is 2022-04-26T10:51:07.084-07:00, which is not before latestEligibleCompactTime=2022-04-26T10:06:23.429-07:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1630\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGobblin-as-a-Service emits flow level events for users to keep track of their flow compilation status, job status, number of workunits etc. However, users rarely if ever track adhoc-flows, where they are generally used in a fire-and-forget manner. Furthermore, keeping track of metrics continuously adds strains to the metric libraries which leads to wasted resources.\r\n\r\nWe should only be emitting flow level events for flows that are scheduled and saved.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a flag for adhoc flows such that downstream executions can also differentiate scheduled and adhoc flows, so that downstream workloads can also prevent the emission of metrics for these flows that are not tracked.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-12T01:14:39Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T07:37:54Z","closed_at":"2022-04-18T23:37:30Z","merged_at":"2022-04-18T23:37:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"172d8793d34ffc454139f2161b228e3fd90ce71d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3491/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3491/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3491/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/ada945326aa91ce34697dc05f58d0e4cf45d6af3","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:remove-metrics-adhoc-flows","ref":"remove-metrics-adhoc-flows","sha":"ada945326aa91ce34697dc05f58d0e4cf45d6af3","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1629\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nNow, GobblinMCEWriter can only catch exception, but we notice that if there is one issue in schema, i.e. recursive schema, it will throw StackOverflowError, and cannot handled by the pipeline and thus block other topics\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nunit test and deployed the change in prod env and verify it works as expected\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-29T21:33:03Z","updated_at":"2022-03-29T22:39:04Z","closed_at":"2022-03-29T22:39:04Z","merged_at":"2022-03-29T22:39:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"b26bd92f06ce3a373d5ec8fae440456654108ad1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3489/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3489/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3489/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/ffa990412721389e27390f6a4d846bc5c00a889d","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOBBLIN-1629","ref":"GOBBLIN-1629","sha":"ffa990412721389e27390f6a4d846bc5c00a889d","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/GOBBLIN/issues/GOBBLIN-1620\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n- GobblinHelixJobLauncher can pick up helix tag and resource config for each Gobblin job run. These configs will be read by YarnAutoScalingManager and YarnService, thus allocated container can have helix instances with required tag and desired resources. Since helix instances can contain unique tags, tasks within each Gobblin job run will be assigned to containers with specific tag and resource.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTest in testing pipeline. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-25T21:08:23Z","updated_at":"2022-04-28T19:46:35Z","closed_at":"2022-04-28T19:46:35Z","merged_at":"2022-04-28T19:46:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"3e877951c284ccd68be3634522f9fc2c3d39f81a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3487/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3487/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3487/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/711145d802e4348922a0dbf352e5c4bb01553939","head":{"label":"hanghangliu:GOBBLIN-1620-enable-helix-tag-group-by-workflow","ref":"GOBBLIN-1620-enable-helix-tag-group-by-workflow","sha":"711145d802e4348922a0dbf352e5c4bb01553939","user":{"login":"hanghangliu","id":64626612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjI2NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64626612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu","html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":264983661,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjQ5ODM2NjE=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"hanghangliu/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hanghangliu","id":64626612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjI2NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64626612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu","html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1625\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThere are edge cases where hive tables are rejected due to the mismatch check not being robust enough. For example:\r\n1. If the user specified path and the existing hive table path are exact matches, we should always return that they are equivalent\r\n\r\n2. If the existing hive table path does not exist on the filesystem, we need to recursively check the parents to see if the fs.uri and folder directories are equivalent\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded test cases for each observed scenario\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1624\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWith the DagManager class in GaaS, during rollout/leader swap it is possible to get an inaccurate count of running jobs emitted, and quotas for these running jobs.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the leader is shut down while keeping track of 10 running jobs, and during restart 5 of these jobs completed, the leader would emit that 0 jobs are currently running since it would not treat the job counters as idempotent. Additionally, we over-decrement due to not differentiating jobs running on the executor that fail, vs jobs that fail on the GaaS side.\r\n\r\nWe should keep track of currently running jobs better to ensure that we only decrement counters/quotas for jobs that are actually running on the executor and track better between startup. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded tests in the DagManagerTest class, will expand tests to the QuotaManager once functionality expands\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1623\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nNow when we try to call httpClient.getClientManager, it's possible that the implementation of httpClient will throw an NPE in this case. To make it more safer, we close the client when it's a CloseableHttpClient and other than that, we rely on the implementation of httpClient to handle the open connection\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- [ ] mint build\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1621\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nNow, when we enable concurrency on gobblin service but disable that on gobblin cluster, gobblin cluster manager will drop the job silently if previous job is running. And from gobblin service, since no update heard back, it will think that job is still waiting for start and then once we exceed job start sla, it will cancel the job, which in turn will cancel the previous running job. And make the long running job never finish in this case. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe solution is to emit job skip event when job get dropped, and on job status monitoring service, we listen to this event and mark the job status as cancelled in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nunit test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1619] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1619\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n#### The current implementation recursively calls fs.mkdirs has the following issues:\r\n- Race condition for creating parent directories, causing FileNotFound exception even when the file exists on file system\r\n- HDFS fs.mkdirs atomically creates missing parent directories. Thus, the recursive approach is making unnecessary calls.\r\n\r\nIn HDFS, which the current [FileSystem](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/api/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FileSystem.html) interface is built upon, guarantees the parents will be created. So, all FileSystem class implementations should also follow this behavior. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSee the [FileSystem](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/api/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FileSystem.html) abstract class documentation:\r\n\r\n> The behaviour of the filesystem is [specified in the Hadoop documentation. ](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/filesystem/filesystem.html)However, the normative specification of the behavior of this class is actually HDFS: if HDFS does not behave the way these Javadocs or the specification in the Hadoop documentations define, assume that the documentation is incorrect\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests added and change tested internally at LinkedIn on parallel fastingest test pipeline. The parallel test pipeline compared the permissions created with previous implementation and with new implementation. There were not any differences in the way permissions are set, so the change is completely transparent and non-breaking. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-11T00:40:15Z","updated_at":"2024-09-25T17:08:27Z","closed_at":"2022-04-21T19:21:02Z","merged_at":"2022-04-21T19:21:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"167d2104cba64cebe44340021d71e383c14e8fa3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3477/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3477/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3477/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/92132c2f8fd44047634974ba28824e986199edec","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-GOBBLIN-1619--optimize-mkdirs","ref":"mh-GOBBLIN-1619--optimize-mkdirs","sha":"92132c2f8fd44047634974ba28824e986199edec","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1614\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nFor Partitioned Hive Tables, Gobblin with attempt to resolve the URI using the FS when performing table equality checks to ensure that the user is not trying to register their table under a new path.\r\n\r\nThis is to fix a bug where snapshot tables could perform this check, but partitioned tables would fail when their paths are equivalent.\r\n\r\nBoolean check for hive table equality was reversed\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested on a partitioned table, added unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-24T04:26:03Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T21:13:46Z","closed_at":"2022-02-24T22:35:52Z","merged_at":"2022-02-24T22:35:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"316ab18a4b157c9da1a3e8588e7b2b9c3dafe421","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3472/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3472/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3472/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/0ec002197ddd53d6cb3a0e53a418f5e9b962cb45","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:fix-bug-hive-table-equality","ref":"fix-bug-hive-table-equality","sha":"0ec002197ddd53d6cb3a0e53a418f5e9b962cb45","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1611\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThe description about  the writer.codec.type property in the document has a little mistake. This PR corrects it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo additional test, since it's just a documentation fix.\r\nI ran `mkdocs serve` locally and confirmed the document was modified as expected.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-16T07:23:12Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T18:16:46Z","closed_at":"2023-02-14T18:16:37Z","merged_at":"2023-02-14T18:16:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"7b6c5fe92bd15e1e8fcf62fd17e1d2302c4a690e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3470/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3470/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3470/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/dc0499917e4a963aa5c3ae3a12176f6832a32601","head":{"label":"sekikn:GOBBLIN-1611","ref":"GOBBLIN-1611","sha":"dc0499917e4a963aa5c3ae3a12176f6832a32601","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":145573154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDU1NzMxNTQ=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"sekikn/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1608\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nWhen `max.error.dateset` is reached and the container is failed, gobblin will cause close() on the writer, which will call flush(). This causes a couple issues with events due to assumptions on where flush() is called.\r\n\r\n- Move `tableOperationTypeMap.remove(tableString)` to before the container is failed, otherwise an extra flush() will be called on the table. This flush() shouldn't actually do anything since writer.reset has been called for the dataset already.\r\n- Don't send error GTEs for all tables if flush() is called from close(). This event emission is here because GMCE watermark is advanced when flush() is called periodically, but when flush() is called from close the watermark is not advanced so events should not be sent.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nTested with one dataset in e2e pipeline.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n@jack-moseley  @ZihanLi58  please review\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1606\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\na) change default value of gobblin_copy_check_filesize to true because it makes more sense to abort the copy if the copied file size does not match the source file size\r\nb) remove the old metric which counts how many bytes are copied, because in case of retries, this can give incorrect value\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nupdated existing unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1604\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIn distcp, if the size or number of files allocated by the RequestAllocator during workunit collection is too large, then Gobblin will log the error:\r\n```\r\n// item does not fit even in empty pool\r\nlog.warn(String.format(\"Request %s is larger than the available resource pool. If the pool is not expanded, \"\r\n        + \"it will never be selected. Request: %s.\", newElement.getT(),\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe job will still be marked as COMMITTED/SUCCESSFUL state. This PR makes the job in FAILED state if there are no items to be copied due to all of them being rejected\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1603\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nHiveCopyEntityHelper will fail silently if it encounters IOExceptions or invalid tables to be copied. We need to propagate these errors so that it will be much easier to debug tables that are failing during this collection step.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1602\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIn scenarios where the paths are equivalent in the underlying FS, hive copy should not treat these paths separately if the user provided URI does not match the hive registered URI. For example, when comparing a logical and physical path, if the FS treats these paths as equivalent then the check to equate table or partition locations should not fail.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1599\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nGobblin depended on an old deprecated Avro API that worked with Jackson JsonNode objects. In Gobblin's default Avro dependency version (1.8) these APIs were already marked as deprecated. In Avro 1.9 these APIs were replaced by similar APIs that work with `Object` rather than `JsonNode` Java objects.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nMy PR does not need unit tests to validate whether it is working. Simply attempting to compile the project with a flag to inject avro 1.9+ (`-PavroVersion=1.9.1`) validates that this PR fixes the issue.\r\nFunctionally the change also worked appropriately as I was able to use newer Avro versions to read events from Kafka using gobblin jobs that depended on these new versions.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-22T18:40:14Z","updated_at":"2022-02-05T06:08:38Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3455/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3455/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3455/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/a5de9fff3275ee9a29fc63d265a7db4cdcfd4c8c","head":{"label":"pedro93:fix-deprecated-avro-api","ref":"fix-deprecated-avro-api","sha":"a5de9fff3275ee9a29fc63d265a7db4cdcfd4c8c","user":{"login":"pedro93","id":3718654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTg2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3718654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93","html_url":"https://github.com/pedro93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":446935783,"node_id":"R_kgDOGqOy5w","name":"gobblin","full_name":"pedro93/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pedro93","id":3718654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTg2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3718654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93","html_url":"https://github.com/pedro93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro93/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pedro93/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1598\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n2021/06/12 07:11:32.067 ERROR [DagManager] [pool-19-thread-3] [gobblin-service-war] [] Exception encountered in org.apache.gobblin.service.modules.orchestration.DagManager$DagManagerThread\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: A metric named GobblinService.testFlow.RunningStatus already exists\r\n at org.apache.gobblin.metrics.InnerMetricContext.register(InnerMetricContext.java:266) \r\n\r\n\r\nLikely root cause:\r\n\r\nIf we activate/deactivate DagManager several times, DagManagerThreads alongside with their flowGauges maps will be recreated, but RootMetricContext will still stay the same. So the newly created threads will incorrectly think that the flow was not registered previously, and try to register it again.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-22T00:14:14Z","updated_at":"2022-01-25T02:58:29Z","closed_at":"2022-01-25T02:58:28Z","merged_at":"2022-01-25T02:58:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"621b7c30616f09342d98179c94772673417e00b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3454/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3454/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3454/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/60cc5655c719248ac0530f9825af9118d43ba8db","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOBBLIN-1598","ref":"GOBBLIN-1598","sha":"60cc5655c719248ac0530f9825af9118d43ba8db","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1594\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nCurrently, a poorly formed SLA time (e.g. String instead of Long) will cause the DagManagerThread to completely stall and not make any progress. This is a short term fix to at least move the DagManager forward if the SLA is not properly defined, future fix will be to verify before flow creation\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nDagManagerTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1591\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nFileContext objects are not cached and you get a new object every time you call FileContext.get()\r\nCurrently Gobblin creates a DataWriter for every Task. These DataWriters are not destroyed till all the Tasks complete committing. In FileAwareInputStreamDataWriter , we hold a reference to FileContext which is quite expensive.\r\nWe should not keep this reference and use it when it is really required during the commit phase, so it can be GC'ed when required\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntested the objects reduction by taking heap dumps\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-10T23:18:04Z","updated_at":"2021-12-14T17:31:49Z","closed_at":"2021-12-14T17:31:49Z","merged_at":"2021-12-14T17:31:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f3c9ce8b028ec4c68a992e070d48b99068e99f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3444/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3444/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3444/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/604f0284bb313d85feb809a64dd4c617f07c801b","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:lazyFileContext","ref":"lazyFileContext","sha":"604f0284bb313d85feb809a64dd4c617f07c801b","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n@sv2000 @phet please review\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1589\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nprovide a way to cache FileContext. This is needed because unlike FileSystem, FileContext is not cached and thus every file being copied in distcp creates a new object of FileContext. This often causes OOM errors.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nadded a unit test in FileContextFactoryTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-08T02:02:19Z","updated_at":"2022-03-13T20:10:14Z","closed_at":"2022-03-13T20:10:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3fa16cccb93e1330e983205edc1976cd6e864277","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3442/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3442/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3442/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/decb9d88e822cc146114e72be940de7157e398eb","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:FileContextFactory","ref":"FileContextFactory","sha":"decb9d88e822cc146114e72be940de7157e398eb","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Allows user to configure a mysql ingestion job to allow replacement of the record's value for an existing record in the table.\r\n* Also replaces a backward iteration of ResultSet() with forward iteration in MySqlWriterCommands\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1584 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe only support insertion of new values into tables, not update/upsert. If you run an ingestion job with a record containing a record with the same primary key the whole job will fail because of the duplicate entry. We don't expect ingestion jobs to always contain only new records, so we should handle duplicate entries, ingestion of data already in the table or updates to old values. The insert vs. replace logic should be configurable to the user as well.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nIt adds a unit test that utilizes replace logic in the JdbcPublisherTest.\r\nI have also tested manually by copying duplicate data and repeated primary keys into a Mysql table and verified the values were updated.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-03T00:42:39Z","updated_at":"2021-12-09T22:37:12Z","closed_at":"2021-12-09T22:37:12Z","merged_at":"2021-12-09T22:37:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"65a3649474be1d8b5203c8cacb16b8e1bcd5455b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3438/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3438/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3438/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/ec0d44a947d8aaf24a19e8f42ab1bfbc83d149eb","head":{"label":"umustafi:addingReplaceLogicToMysqlWriter","ref":"addingReplaceLogicToMysqlWriter","sha":"ec0d44a947d8aaf24a19e8f42ab1bfbc83d149eb","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1579\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen path of the existing hive table in target does not match with the desired path of the target table to be copied, HiveTableLocationNotMatchException is logged, empty list is returned and job state is set to committed. Propagating the HiveTableLocationNotMatchException so that job state can be set as failed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnpartitionedTableFileSetTest.java\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1575\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGobblinTaskRunner creates a HelixManager and passes it to HelixJobTask. When the GobblinTaskRunner is stopped, it disconnects to HelixManager, but because the HelixJobTask is also using the same HelixManager object, it cannot use it do its own shutdown operation. This PR will make a copy of HelixManager to be used by HelixJobTask 's.\r\n\r\nSame argument with GobblinClusterManager passing the same HelixManager object to HelixRetriggeringJobCallable\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntrivial changes\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1569\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nAdd RDBMS-backed `MysqlJobCatalog`, as alternative to file system storage\r\n\r\nPresent storage bindings for `JobCatalog` are in-memory or file system.  While the latter is durable, it requires an NFS-like capability for cross-instance sharing.\r\n\r\nSupport alternative multi-instance backing through MySQL, precluding the need for NFS.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNew unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1568\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nRight now the wait time between polling is fixed 1 min, which would potentially generate too many Salesforce calls when the bulk job is large. Thus, this PR proposes to do exponential backoff with min of 1 min and max of 10 min to reduce the polling frequency.\r\nIn addition, this PR also changed the logger position, so as to make more sense.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nOnly affecting wait time and logging\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-27T21:12:43Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T00:43:02Z","closed_at":"2021-10-28T00:43:02Z","merged_at":"2021-10-28T00:43:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"7fe8f975c050556e7f049474d7abc30d8f0a498b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3420/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3420/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3420/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/0bf2a73e269a064f8582503d246924c33f9072ca","head":{"label":"williamwjs:salesforceBulkApiBackoff","ref":"salesforceBulkApiBackoff","sha":"0bf2a73e269a064f8582503d246924c33f9072ca","user":{"login":"williamwjs","id":7764707,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NjQ3MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7764707?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs","html_url":"https://github.com/williamwjs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":421934315,"node_id":"R_kgDOGSY06w","name":"gobblin","full_name":"williamwjs/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"williamwjs","id":7764707,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NjQ3MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7764707?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs","html_url":"https://github.com/williamwjs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamwjs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/williamwjs/gobblin","description":"A

will not affect other topics in the same container\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1565\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGMIP should be fault tolerant, so that one topic failure should not affect other topics in the same container. One potential solution is that we can catch the error and document the error dataset, if we have more than one datasets have issue, that normally something wrong happening on the whole job, we should fail the task, but if there is only one problematic topic, we can handle the exception and let the pipeline move on and process other topics.\r\nLeft some todo for emitting GTE so that we can rely on those event to detect failure and do backfill as needed\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdd new unit test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-25T21:31:50Z","updated_at":"2024-09-27T15:09:47Z","closed_at":"2021-11-10T01:24:29Z","merged_at":"2021-11-10T01:24:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"62a434474d96cdf63bd4913846f6ca07f8c9e5e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3419/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3419/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3419/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/2786777bcfeb2804ddb56e58144b4993ce36a4ff","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOBBLIN-1565","ref":"GOBBLIN-1565","sha":"2786777bcfeb2804ddb56e58144b4993ce36a4ff","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1562\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThe `MySqlSpecStore` essentially presumes to store only `FlowSpec`s, and thus would not work for `TopologySpec`s.  That leaves only the `FSSpecStore` for them, not a backing RDBMS.  Hence, we refactor `MysqlSpecStore` into a general store, truly for any `Spec` object, with nothing specific to `FlowSpec`.  That now works for topology specs as well.  Still, we retain a specialization with the existing `FlowSpec`-specific logic supporting search/retrieval.\r\n\r\nTo maintain backwards-compatibility, we avoid changing/re-naming the semantics of `MysqlSpecStore`.  So, the refactored `SpecStore` generalization is named `MysqlNonFlowSpecStore`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNew unit test, `MysqlNonFlowSpecStoreTest`.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-15T07:43:52Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T20:26:11Z","closed_at":"2021-10-25T20:26:11Z","merged_at":"2021-10-25T20:26:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"255bdc15f4e8dd7dbf5fb94e9742d8430f2506f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3414/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3414/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3414/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/b452bd231595d644f8159604dea7d1b7e2bcc492","head":{"label":"phet:MysqlNonFlowSpecStore","ref":"MysqlNonFlowSpecStore","sha":"b452bd231595d644f8159604dea7d1b7e2bcc492","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n- [ ] Leverages AvroCompatibilityHelper to upgrade to Avro 1.9.2\r\n- [ ] With Avro 1.9, Type with \"null\" union is adding \"default: null\". This was not generated and validated by earlier version. Corrected the input test schemas/files and fixed the failed tests.\r\n- [ ] Union with default EnumString name fails as Avro 1.9.2 uses internal JacksonUtils to convert to corresponding JsonNode and it does not support enumString as default.\r\n- [ ] Some failed tests are fixed and added todo list for some of the failed tests. The reason for some of the failures is due to Helix, Hadoop, Hive libraries are using older Jackson version. \r\n- [ ] Reference PR - https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3328 (Initial Avro upgrade investigation PR)\r\n\r\nAvro 1.9 compatible change done earlier:\r\n- [ ] Replace the public APIs which are deprecated/removed with the ones compatible with Avro 1.9 - https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3349 (Done)\r\n- [ ] Upgrade jackson mapper from 1.x to 2.x compatible with Avro 1.9 - https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3368 (Done)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-14T15:24:06Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T16:10:57Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"988346565b2523ee608bcbf5a237a3ce736ed2ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3413/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3413/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3413/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/089c1e8014ea73e7ff9c1db3ce331fca8f246a1f","head":{"label":"abhisheknath2011:avro_1_9_dev","ref":"avro_1_9_dev","sha":"089c1e8014ea73e7ff9c1db3ce331fca8f246a1f","user":{"login":"abhisheknath2011","id":679579,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTU3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/679579?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011","html_url":"https://github.com/abhisheknath2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":379564417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzk1NjQ0MTc=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"abhisheknath2011/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"abhisheknath2011","id":679579,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTU3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/679579?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011","html_url":"https://github.com/abhisheknath2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/abhisheknath2011/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1561\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen flow compilation fails, it prints a large list of irrelevant configs that are missing from different edges. The reason for this is that the pathfinding does not know what the intended path was, so it doesn't know which edges were actually missing required config. For example, this create flow command: \r\n\r\ncurli --dv-auth SELF --fabric ei-ltx1 \"d2://sharedFlowconfigsV2\" -X POST -H 'X-RestLi-Method: create' -H 'X-RestLi-Protocol-Version: 2.0.0' --data '{\"id\": {\"flowName\": \"test123\", \"flowGroup\": \"test123\"}, \"properties\": {\"gobblin.flow.sourceIdentifier\": \"faro\", \"gobblin.flow.destinationIdentifier\": \"faro\", \"user.to.proxy\": \"gobblintest\", \"gobblin.flow.input.dataset.descriptor.path\": \"/tmp/gaas-cli-test/a\", \"gobblin.flow.output.dataset.descriptor.path\": \"/tmp/gaas-cli-test/a\", \"gobblin.flow.input.dataset.descriptor.partition.type\": \"none\", \"gobblin.flow.output.dataset.descriptor.partition.type\": \"none\", \"report.job.progress\": \"true\", \"flow.applyRetention\": \"true\", \"flow.applyInputRetention\": \"true\", \"gobblin.retention.newestK.versions.retained\": \"0\", \"dataset.datetimePattern\": \"yyyy/MM/dd\", \"copy.date.pattern\": \"yyyy/MM/dd\"}, \"templateUris\": \"FS:///\"}'\r\nFails because the \"version.finder\" property is unresolved for the faro_faro_retention edge, but that info is buried in this large error message:\r\n\r\n\"Flow was not compiled successfully.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

removes gauges after reporting interval\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1560 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAt the moment, once a gauge for work unit count is set. The value will be continually emitted to inGraphs until the value is changed, making it confusing for users to tell what the most recently set value is. Instead we will unregister this gauge after an interval we expect the value to be emitted to inGraphs so the graph will appear as a set of data points. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nManually tested with local deployment of gaas by starting jobs and using log statements to see the gauges are removed. Shutdown service as well to ensure the scheduled threads are removed. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-07T23:32:08Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T21:01:21Z","closed_at":"2022-01-13T21:01:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"613bad0f4c6677dee5a5509a4afe4c375d2fc235","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3411/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3411/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3411/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/b11bab68a5c553a985e4f4b266a1fb73950b31d3","head":{"label":"umustafi:fixWorkUnitMetricsEmission","ref":"fixWorkUnitMetricsEmission","sha":"b11bab68a5c553a985e4f4b266a1fb73950b31d3","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nThis is my second PR, I hope I'm doing it in a way that works for you folks :)\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1558\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Make BaseDataPublisher behavior possible to override when publishing to new folders.\r\n- [ ] Override the new method in TimePartitionedDataPublisher for it to record subfolder-granularity published folders (instead of parent one) when publishing into a new folder.\r\n- [ ] Clean TimePartitionedStreamingDataPublisher from the code providing the functionality now provided b the parent class.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] No test for BaseDataPublisher, the behavior doesn't change.\r\n- [ ] TimePartitionedDataPublisherTest for TimePartitionedDataPublisher is a copy from the one original created for TimePartitionedStreamingDataPublisher.\r\n- [ ] TimePartitionedStreamingDataPublisherTest has been updated to reuse TimePartitionedDataPublisherTest.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-06T19:06:25Z","updated_at":"2021-11-04T05:42:37Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3409/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3409/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3409/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/efc2ff18a44badd1463ffb7f64ff7ba269442030","head":{"label":"jobar:update_basedatapublisher","ref":"update_basedatapublisher","sha":"efc2ff18a44badd1463ffb7f64ff7ba269442030","user":{"login":"jobar","id":1686047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODYwNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1686047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar","html_url":"https://github.com/jobar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":340017124,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDAwMTcxMjQ=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"jobar/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jobar","id":1686047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODYwNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1686047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar","html_url":"https://github.com/jobar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jobar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jobar/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1553\r\n    - this is one hotfix\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThere is one update in upstream that support get iceberg schema for non-optinal union type, but get metrics will throw exception. So we need to catch this kind of exception when get metrics as well\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1552\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nflow status is determined by looking at the flow level events. but flow level events are not emitted outside of dag manager. so currently flow status is not being determined correctly when dag manager is disabled.\r\nthis pr adds a field `flowStatus` to FlowStatus class, which is determined by JobStatus'es when DagManager is not enabled. in a way it used to be done prior to https://github.com/apache/gobblin/commit/59f3beeea1e62dcc1f3901f082e46bc3d237f9fb#diff-141f30f7aa658e9e18316e3e5ecea3b92865dcc88a4c0809b6d5c0ef1598e410 \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\na couple of new unit tests are added. existing test cases are updated\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-25T18:11:34Z","updated_at":"2021-11-10T23:07:39Z","closed_at":"2021-11-10T23:07:39Z","merged_at":"2021-11-10T23:07:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"55e64979075fb50f83303c7f0f9dc631d6a018ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3403/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3403/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3403/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/7ab8ba2f549b58e5cced1047a9b06726b0233463","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:flowStatusWithoutDagManager2","ref":"flowStatusWithoutDagManager2","sha":"7ab8ba2f549b58e5cced1047a9b06726b0233463","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1552\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nflow status is determined by looking at the flow level events. but flow level events are not emitted outside of dag manager. so currently flow status is not being determined correctly when dag manager is disabled.\r\nthis pr adds a field flowStatus to FlowStatus class, which is determined by JobStatus'es when DagManager is not enabled. in a way it used to be done prior to 59f3bee#diff-141f30f7aa658e9e18316e3e5ecea3b92865dcc88a4c0809b6d5c0ef1598e410\r\n\r\nAnother refactoring this PR does is to make getJobStatusesForFlowExecution in jobStatusRetriever return a list instead of an Iterator, this is done because flow status determination needs to iterate through this iterator and the iterator cannot be re-parsed so it become unusable afterwards.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nadded a couple of unit tests and updated the existing ones\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-24T21:40:36Z","updated_at":"2024-09-12T17:38:49Z","closed_at":"2024-09-12T17:38:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d4cf602f8ef24c22a708a594d0f811a256eb0ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3402/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3402/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3402/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/be7a4c8fd6c34cd02b90e786e224c10601421c7e","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:iteratorToList","ref":"iteratorToList","sha":"be7a4c8fd6c34cd02b90e786e224c10601421c7e","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

It is private static now, while it could actually be useful for other use cases especially when it comes to crafting Hive DDL to create Hive views for example. \r\n\r\nThis PR is to increase the visibility of the method `generateAvroToHiveColumnMapping` by copying it into a utility class, and add some basic unit tests for this method. There's no change to the `generateAvroToHiveColumnMapping` itself except making sure the newly created utility class is conforming to Gobblin style in terms of line length etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo change in the functionality and added one more unit test.  Passing existing unit test should be sufficient.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1546\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThe kafka job status monitor is currently calling `readSchemaVersioningInformation` to advance the input stream of the kafka messages it reads to the record portion, which calls the schema registry every time, but the result of it is ignored. This PR adds another API that just advances the input stream without contacting the schema registry, to remove a point of failure.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntested in local gaas deployment\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-17T01:21:49Z","updated_at":"2021-09-20T17:18:45Z","closed_at":"2021-09-20T17:18:45Z","merged_at":"2021-09-20T17:18:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"b729be0a94ffa61d5b4b3690859b365bd567f6b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3397/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3397/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3397/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/9e13ec6387f0efad3b1d295c07b5e0eec0180fce","head":{"label":"jack-moseley:skip-registry","ref":"skip-registry","sha":"9e13ec6387f0efad3b1d295c07b5e0eec0180fce","user":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67752782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Nzc1Mjc4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"jack-moseley/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley/gobblin","description":"Universal
