What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport push down `GreaterThanOrEqual` minimum value and `LessThanOrEqual` maximum value for Parquet  when [sources.In](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/a744fea3be12f1a53ab553040b95da730210bc88/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/sources/filters.scala#L162-L181)'s values exceeds `spark.sql.optimizer.inSetRewriteMinMaxThreshold`. For example:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM t WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will push down `id >= 1 and id <= 15`.\r\n\r\nImpala also has this improvement: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IMPALA-3654\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove query performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test, [manual test](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29642#issuecomment-743109098) and benchmark test.\r\n\r\nBefore this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe optimization result of `CostBasedJoinReorder` is non-deterministic now, it affected by the input order if there have more than one same cost candidate plans.\r\n\r\nIn this pr give a way to make it deterministic as much as possible, the main change of this pr as follow:\r\n\r\n- Sort the items which use to produce candidate plans in descending order according to `rowCount` and `sizeInBytes` to ensure the deterministic of input items as much as possible.\r\n\r\n- Change to use `LinkedHashMap` instead of `HashMap` to make sure that items are inserted and iterated in the same order.\r\n\r\n- Add a new test case to `StarJoinCostBasedReorderSuite` to verify all input permutations have the same optimization result\r\n\r\n- Regenerate golden files used by `TPCDSV2_7_PlanStabilityWithStatsSuite`, `TPCDSV1_4_PlanStabilityWithStatsSuite` and `TPCDSModifiedPlanStabilityWithStatsSuite` affected by this sort behavior\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nLet `CostBasedJoinReorder` produce optimization result, independent of input order. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Add a new test case named `Test 7: SPARK-32687 Verify all input permutations have the same optimization result`\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.12: Pass the Jenkins or GitHub

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes a bug `FileSourceStrategy`, which generates partition filters even if the table is not partitioned. This can confuse `FileSourceScanExec`, which mistakenly think the table is partitioned and tries to update the `numPartitions` metrics, and cause a failure. We should not generate partition filters for non-partitioned table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe bug was exposed by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29436.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, fix a bug.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe whole `DynamicPartitionPruningSuite` takes about 2 min on my laptop (either AE on or off). The slowest tests are `test(\"simple inner join triggers DPP with mock-up tables\")` and `test(\"cleanup any DPP filter that isn't pushed down due to expression id clashes\")`, which totally take about 1 min.\r\n\r\nWe can reuse existing test tables or use smaller tables to reduce the cost. After that, the two tests takes only about 1 sec in total, leading to 2x speedup for the suite.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo speedup DPP test suites.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nModified two existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMove StreamingRelationV2 to the catalyst module and bind with the Table interface.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, the StreamingRelationV2 is bind with TableProvider. Since the V2 relation is not bound with `DataSource`, to make it more flexible and have better expansibility, it should be moved to the catalyst module and bound with the Table interface. We did a similar thing for DataSourceV2Relation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

Ie3e2a6cc08b4c0e8770417c3b66f2f747bebefda\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently logDir just refers to one directory. We would like to add a capability to HistoryServer UI to read from multiple directories. \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOur service dynamically creates short-lived YARN clusters in cloud. Spark applications run on these dynamically created clusters. We want a static instance of SparkHistoryServer to view information on jobs that ran on these clusters. \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running existing test suites.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-02T23:20:09Z","updated_at":"2020-12-19T00:51:12Z","closed_at":"2020-12-19T00:51:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fec36e62409ce8766b7e3f47fa4a30543017e86e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29630/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29630/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29630/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5cce482ac0a623aaa9d4657995bb2f5574a9a9a4","head":{"label":"Gaurangi94:logdirectoryregex","ref":"logdirectoryregex","sha":"5cce482ac0a623aaa9d4657995bb2f5574a9a9a4","user":{"login":"Gaurangi94","id":5628082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjgwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5628082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94","html_url":"https://github.com/Gaurangi94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":292384631,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTIzODQ2MzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"Gaurangi94/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Gaurangi94","id":5628082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjgwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5628082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94","html_url":"https://github.com/Gaurangi94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaurangi94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Gaurangi94/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDisplay driver host name on History UI page. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32135\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOur service dynamically creates short-lived YARN clusters in cloud. Spark applications run on these dynamically created clusters. Log data for these applications is stored on a remote file-system. We configure a static instance of SparkHistoryServer to view information on jobs that ran on these clusters. \r\n\r\nSince we are using a single History Server for multiple clusters, it will be useful for users to have information on where the jobs were executed. We would like to display this information on the main web-page, instead of having users go through multiple links to retrieve this information.\r\n\r\nWe chose to display driverHost on the web-page as it reflects cluster name. If this information is not available we leave cluster name as blank. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n![image-2020-09-02-12-37-55-860](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/92086891-c2488080-ee05-11ea-96d8-0684270a603b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded driverHost to json files to verify HTTP response. Ran HistoryServerSuite.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-02T22:19:35Z","updated_at":"2020-12-19T00:51:13Z","closed_at":"2020-12-19T00:51:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0edb2f8a909e7683197f93057dccd98348b0c0bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue for parsing aliasing typed interval values\r\n\r\ne.g.  cases below should be all valid ones\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n\r\n         > select interval '1 day' abc;\r\nError in query:\r\nError parsing ' 1 day abc' to interval, unrecognized number 'abc'(line 1, pos 16)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nselect interval '1 day' abc\r\n----------------^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> select interval '1 day' as abc;\r\nError in query:\r\nError parsing ' 1 day as' to interval, unrecognized number 'as'(line 1, pos 16)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nselect interval '1 day' as abc\r\n----------------^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, these cases will be captured by grammar rule `multiUnitsInterval` but not `typedLiteral`, e.g. for interval '1 day' day, the value is `1 day` and the unit is day， which actually should be parsed as `((interval 1 day) as day)`\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I add a new rule \"INTERVAL STRING AS? identifier? \" to handle interval typed literals(maybe aliasing) and 1-stringvalue-unit interval together and before the rule `multiUnitsInterval`.\r\n\r\nwhen the \"AS\" key is not null, the `STRING` must be the whole context of the interval whether it is valid or not, the identifier should be the alias name or else the \"AS\" itself as alias name.\r\n\r\nwhen the \"AS\" key is null\r\n    1 and when the `STRING` contains any alphabet, we can assume that the  `STRING` is the whole context of the interval whether it is valid or not. the identifier part will be alias name if present\r\n    2 and when the `STRING` contains no alphabet, e.g. '1' day, '-1' day, '\\t1' day, so the identifier here should be the unit part whether it is valid or not.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

Previously in `FileSourceScanExec` -> `FileScanRDD`, we read input file sequentially one by one. For sorted bucket table which potentially can have multiple sorted files per bucket, the sort ordering for each bucket cannot be preserved as we read sorted files one by one. This PR is to add the support to read sorted files all together in a sort-merge way to preserve the ordering for each bucket.\r\n\r\nSpecifically the code change is:\r\n* Add a parameter `ScanMode` (which can be either `RowMode` (read row by row - non-vectorization), `BatchMode` (read batch by batch - vectorization), or `SortedBucketMode` (read rows in sort-merge way - sorted bucketed file case)) for `FileScanRDD`. `FileScanRDD.compute()` decides which iterator to use based on this `ScanMode`.\r\n\r\n* Extract the existing iterator logic in `FileScanRDD` to `BaseFileScanIterator`, which holds common logic for file scan. `BaseFileScanIterator` has 3 subclasses where `FileRowScanIterator` reads row by row for each file (`RowMode`), and `FileBatchScanIterator` reads batch by batch for each file (`BatchMode`), and `FileSortedBucketScanIterator` reads row by row based on each row ordering across multiple files (`SortedBucketMode`).\r\n\r\n* `FileSortedBucketScanIterator`: a priority queue is used to output rows from multiple sorted files based on table sorted columns.\r\n\r\nThe PR also separates the logic for existing row scan and batch scan, so we don't need to do `if (nextElement.isInstanceOf[ColumnarBatch]) {` at line 100 of `FileScanRDD` per row, which was a long-standing TODO.\r\n\r\nThe whole feature is controlled by a new config `spark.sql.sources.bucketing.sortedScan.enabled` which is disabled by default, as there can be a risk to read more data in task and cause OOM (especially with vectorization, we need to keep each batch of each file in memory at any time). In addition, we need to set `InputFileBlockHolder` for each row (as any row from any file can be outputted), so it can be costly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRight now for sorted bucket table, even though each individual file is sorted, the current file scan approach does not preserve sort ordering across files in one bucket, so a sort still needs for a sort-merge join or sort aggregate. If the table is big, the external sort can happen and cause extra CPU and IO overhead. Introducing the code path here to read multiple sorted files in a sort-merge way to avoid later sort before join or aggregate, to save CPU and IO resource.\r\n\r\nAt our internal fork, we added the similar support (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brzInUisshY&feature=youtu.be&t=910), though the code path is different (we are reading/writing hive table).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. A new user-facing config `spark.sql.sources.bucketing.sortedScan.enabled` is introduced to allow users to read sorted bucketed table efficiently (e.g. no sort for sort merge join / sort aggregate on bucketed columns).\r\n\r\nExample query plan with no `Sort` before `SortMergeJoin`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSortMergeJoin [i#38, j#39], [i#44, j#45], Inner\r\n:- Filter (isnotnull(i#38) AND isnotnull(j#39))\r\n:  +- FileScan parquet default.bucketed_table1[i#38,j#39,k#40] DataFilters: [isnotnull(i#38), isnotnull(j#39)], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex[file:/Users/chengsu/spark/sql/core/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.sql.sources..., PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(i), IsNotNull(j)], ReadSchema: struct<i:int,j:int,k:string>, ScanMode: SortedBucketMode, SelectedBucketsCount: 8 out of 8\r\n+- Filter (isnotnull(i#44) AND isnotnull(j#45))\r\n   +- FileScan parquet default.bucketed_table2[i#44,j#45,k#46] DataFilters: [isnotnull(i#44), isnotnull(j#45)], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex[file:/Users/chengsu/spark/sql/core/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.sql.sources..., PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(i), IsNotNull(j)], ReadSchema: struct<i:int,j:int,k:string>, ScanMode: SortedBucketMode, SelectedBucketsCount: 8 out of 8\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPropagateEmptyRelation will not be applied to LIMIT operators in streaming queries.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nRight now, the limit operator in a streaming query may get optimized away when the relation is empty. This can be problematic for stateful streaming, as this empty batch will not write any state store files, and the next batch will fail when trying to read these state store files and throw a file not found error.\r\n\r\nWe should not let PropagateEmptyRelation optimize away the Limit operator for streaming queries.\r\n\r\nThis PR is intended as a small and safe fix for PropagateEmptyRelation. A fundamental fix that can prevent this from happening again in the future and in other optimizer rules is more desirable, but that's a much larger task.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nunit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR changes the behavior of `sc.listJars` and `sc.listFiles` to list jars/files added by --jars/--files options when we run apps on YARN.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix the inconsistent behavior between YARN and other cluster managers.\r\nJars/files specified with --jars / --files options are listed by sc.listJars and listFiles except when we run apps on YARN.\r\nIf we run apps not on YARN, those files are served by the embedded file server in the driver and listJars/listFiles list the served files.\r\n```\r\n$ bin/spark-shell --master spark://localhost:7077 --jars /tmp/test1.jar --files /tmp/test1.txt\r\nscala> sc.listJars\r\nres0: Seq[String] = Vector(spark://192.168.1.204:35969/jars/test1.jar)\r\nscala> sc.listFiles\r\nres1: Seq[String] = Vector(spark://192.168.1.204:35969/files/test1.txt)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut with YARN, such files specified by the options are not served by the embedded file server so listJars and listFiles don't list them.\r\n```\r\n$ bin/spark-shell --master yarn --jars /tmp/test1.jar --files /tmp/test1.txt\r\nscala> sc.listJars\r\nres0: Seq[String] = Vector()\r\nscala> sc.listFiles\r\nres1: Seq[String] = Vector()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. The behavior of listJars/listFiles are consistent among supported cluster managers.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nFor YARN client mode, I ran the following code with spark-shell and confirmed the result.\r\n```\r\n$ bin/spark-shell --master yarn --jars /tmp/test1.jar,hdfs:///tmp/test2.jar --files /tmp/test1.txt,hdfs:///tmp/test2.txt\r\nscala> sc.listJars\r\nres0: Seq[String] = Vector(file:///tmp/test1.jar,

ran the following code and confirmed the result in the ApplicationMaster log.\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.internal.Logging\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\r\n\r\nobject ListJarsTest extends Logging {\r\n  def main(args: Array[String]) {\r\n    val spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"ListJarsTest\").getOrCreate\r\n    val sc = spark.sparkContext\r\n    println(\"Jars\")\r\n    sc.listJars.foreach(println)\r\n    println(\"Files\")\r\n    sc.listFiles.foreach(println)\r\n\r\n    // dummy\r\n    spark.range(1, 2).collect\r\n    spark.stop()\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, EliminateJoinToEmptyRelation Rule will convert Join into EmptyRelation in some cases with AQE on. But if streamedSide of Join is a ShuffleQueryStage(canChangeNumPartitions == false), which means the Exchange produced by repartition Or singlePartition, in this case, if we were to convert it into an EmptyRelation, it will lost user specified number partition information for downstream operator, it's not right. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNumPartition info incorrect when streamedSide is a repartition plan or SinglePartition plan.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded case in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`sql-expression-schema.md` automatically generated by `ExpressionsSchemaSuite`, but only expressions entries are checked in `ExpressionsSchemaSuite`. So if we manually modify the contents of the file,  `ExpressionsSchemaSuite` does not necessarily guarantee the correctness of the it some times. For example, [Spark-24884](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27507) added `regexp_extract_all`  expression support, and manually modify the `sql-expression-schema.md` but not change the content of `Number of queries` cause file content inconsistency.\r\n\r\nSome additional checks have been added to `ExpressionsSchemaSuite` to improve the correctness guarantee of `sql-expression-schema.md` as follow:\r\n\r\n- `Number of queries` should equals size of `expressions entries` in `sql-expression-schema.md`\r\n\r\n- `Number of expressions that missing example` should equals size of `Expressions missing examples` in `sql-expression-schema.md`\r\n\r\n- `MissExamples` from case should same as  `expectedMissingExamples` from `sql-expression-schema.md`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEnsure the correctness of `sql-expression-schema.md` content.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nEnhanced

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor queries with multiple foldable distinct columns, since they will be eliminated during\r\nexecution, it's not mandatory to let `RewriteDistinctAggregates` handle this case. And\r\nin the current code, `RewriteDistinctAggregates` *dose* miss some \"aggregating with\r\nmultiple foldable distinct expressions\" cases.\r\nFor example: `select count(distinct 2), count(distinct 2, 3)` will be missed.\r\n\r\nBut in the planner, this will trigger an error that \"multiple distinct expressions\" are not allowed.\r\nAs the foldable distinct columns can be eliminated finally, we can allow this in the aggregation\r\nplanner check.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nbug fix\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR increases the thread safety of the `BytesToBytesMap`:\r\n- It makes the `iterator()` and `destructiveIterator()` methods used their own `Location` object. This used to be shared, and this was causing issues when the map was being iterated over in two threads by two different iterators.\r\n- Removes the `safeIterator()` function. This is not needed anymore.\r\n- Improves the documentation of a couple of methods w.r.t. thread-safety.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is unexpected an iterator shares the object it is returning with all other iterators. This is a violation of the iterator contract, and it causes issues with iterators over a map that are consumed in different threads.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadd

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up on SPARK-32721 and PR #29567. In the previous PR we missed two more cases that can be optimized:\r\n```\r\nif(p, false, null) ==> and(not(p), null)\r\nif(p, true, null) ==> or(p, null)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBy transforming if to boolean conjunctions or disjunctions, we can enable more filter pushdown to datasources.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUse `CodeGenerator.typeName()` instead of `Class.getCanonicalName()` in `CodegenContext.addReferenceObj()` for getting the runtime class name for an object.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29439 fixed a bug in `CodegenContext.addReferenceObj()` for `Array[Byte]` (i.e. Spark SQL's `BinaryType`) objects, but unfortunately it introduced a regression for some nested Scala types.\r\n\r\nFor example, for `implicitly[Ordering[UTF8String]]`, after that PR `CodegenContext.addReferenceObj()` would return `((null) references[0] /* ... */)`. The actual type for `implicitly[Ordering[UTF8String]]` is `scala.math.LowPriorityOrderingImplicits$$anon$3` in Scala 2.12.10, and `Class.getCanonicalName()` returns `null` for that class.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, `Class.getName()` is safe to use for all non-array types, and Janino will happily accept the type name returned from `Class.getName()` for nested types. `CodeGenerator.typeName()` happens to do the right thing by correctly handling arrays and otherwise use `Class.getName()`. So it's a better alternative than `Class.getCanonicalName()`.\r\n\r\nSide note: rule of thumb for using Java reflection in Spark: it may be tempting to use `Class.getCanonicalName()`, but for functions that may need to handle Scala types, please avoid it due to potential issues with nested Scala types.\r\nInstead, use `Class.getName()` or utility functions in `org.apache.spark.util.Utils` (e.g. `Utils.getSimpleName()` or `Utils.getFormattedClassName()` etc).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new unit test case for the regression case in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`InSubquery` can be either single-column mode, or multi-column mode, depending on the output length of the subquery. For multi-column mode, the length of input `values` must match the subquery output length.\r\n\r\nHowever, `InSubqueryExec` doesn't follow it and always be executed under single column mode. It's OK as it's only used by DPP, which looks up one key in one `InSubqueryExec`, so the multi-column mode is not needed. But it's better to make the physical and logical node consistent.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `InSubqueryExec` to support multi-column mode, and also fix `SubqueryBroadcastExec` to report output correctly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix a potential bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

effects\r\n\r\n3 -> The type does not correspond, the data precision may be lost during the conversion process\r\n\r\nFor the decimal type, Spark needs to match the label according to its scale and precision attributes.\r\n\r\n**There are five code changes:**\r\n\r\n- Added a user configuration\r\n\r\n  Users can use the data source option `conversionMode` or global SQL option `spark.sql.parquet.conversionMode` to set the data conversion mode. There are three modes available.\r\n\r\n  `MATCH`(default): Only convert label 1 in the table.\r\n\r\n  `NO_SIDE_EFFECTS`: Convert labels 1 and 2 in the table.\r\n\r\n  `LOSS_PRECISION`: Convert all labels 1, 2 and 3 in the table.\r\n\r\n- Added instructions for conversion\r\n\r\n  *In docs/sql-data-sources-parquet.md*.\r\n\r\n- Added a checker to determine whether it can be converted\r\n\r\n  The checker will obtain the Spark `requiredSchema` and the schema of the parquet file footer metadata. The checker checks the mapping relationship between the two schemas according to the `conversionMode` to determine whether the type conversion is allowed.\r\n\r\n  If the conversion is not allowed, an exception is thrown.\r\n\r\n  *The main logic is in `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.SparkParquetSchemaChecker`*\r\n\r\n- Added conversion logic for spark.sql.parquet.enableVectorizedReader=false\r\n\r\n  *The main logic is in `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetRowConverter`*\r\n\r\n- Added conversion logic for spark.sql.parquet.enableVectorizedReader=true\r\n\r\n  *The main logic is in `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetColumnConverter`*\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark uses `requiredSchema` to convert the read parquet file data. It does not consider that the `requiredSchema` and the schema stored in the file may be different.\r\n\r\nThis may potentially cause data correctness problems. For example ([SPARK-32317](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32317)), this decimal data correctness problem.\r\n\r\nI think it is necessary to consider the mapping between the `requiredSchema` and the schema stored in the file. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\n1. User configuration\r\n\r\n   Users can use the data source option `conversionMode` or global SQL option `spark.sql.parquet.conversionMode` to set the data conversion mode. There are three modes available:`MATCH`, `NO_SIDE_EFFECTS`, `LOSS_PRECISION` .\r\n\r\n2. Runtime exception\r\n\r\n   - The checker checks the schema mapping relationship between spark and parquet according to the conversionMode to determine whether the type conversion is allowed. If the conversion relationship is not allowed, throw an exception.\r\n   - When an error occurs or data overflow occurs during data conversion, an exception is thrown, instead of implicitly assigning the wrong data to null.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n// TODO  Added UTs\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-31T17:31:16Z","updated_at":"2020-11-11T12:22:06Z","closed_at":"2020-11-11T12:22:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1496047285,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDk2MDQ3Mjg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/EXAMPLES","name":"EXAMPLES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29600/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29600/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29600/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d782734dd23488c96bef115a27d64a50bc9fdbd9","head":{"label":"izchen:SPARK-32317","ref":"SPARK-32317","sha":"d782734dd23488c96bef115a27d64a50bc9fdbd9","user":{"login":"izchen","id":67534059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTM0MDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67534059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen","html_url":"https://github.com/izchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":277137796,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzcxMzc3OTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"izchen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"izchen","id":67534059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTM0MDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67534059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen","html_url":"https://github.com/izchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/izchen/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR changes `AttributeSet` and `ExpressionSet` to maintain the insertion order of the elements. More specifically, we:\r\n- change the underlying data structure of `AttributeSet` from `HashSet` to `LinkedHashSet` to maintain the insertion order.\r\n- `ExpressionSet` already uses a list to keep track of the expressions, however, since it is extending Scala's immutable.Set class, operations such as map and flatMap are delegated to the immutable.Set itself. This means that the result of these operations is not an instance of ExpressionSet anymore, rather it's a implementation picked up by the parent class. We also remove this inheritance from `immutable.Set `and implement the needed methods directly. ExpressionSet has a very specific semantics and it does not make sense to extend `immutable.Set` anyway.\r\n- change the `PlanStabilitySuite` to not sort the attributes, to be able to catch changes in the order of expressions in different runs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nExpressions identity is based on the `ExprId` which is an auto-incremented number. This means that the same query can yield a query plan with different expression ids in different runs. `AttributeSet` and `ExpressionSet` internally use a `HashSet` as the underlying data structure, and therefore cannot guarantee the a fixed order of operations in different runs. This can be problematic in cases we like to check for plan changes in different runs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPasses `PlanStabilitySuite` after regenerating the golden files.\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-31T14:37:41Z","updated_at":"2020-09-08T14:43:03Z","closed_at":"2020-09-03T11:56:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1215667fb4aeb30569a49a89eedf3a7b3537e023","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29598/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29598/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29598/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9590555915b921a9954f7fe11dc04eef0de197c4","head":{"label":"dbaliafroozeh:FixOrderOfExpressions","ref":"FixOrderOfExpressions","sha":"9590555915b921a9954f7fe11dc04eef0de197c4","user":{"login":"dbaliafroozeh","id":50329522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzI5NTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50329522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaliafroozeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":200818224,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDA4MTgyMjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"dbaliafroozeh/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dbaliafroozeh","id":50329522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzI5NTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50329522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaliafroozeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dbaliafroozeh/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nNow three join reorder suites(`JoinReorderSuite`, `StarJoinReorderSuite`, `StarJoinCostBasedReorderSuite`) all contain an `assertEqualPlans` method and the logic is almost the same. We can extract the method to a single place for code simplicity.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo reduce code redundancy.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nCovered by existing tests.","created_at":"2020-08-31T09:19:41Z","updated_at":"2020-09-01T16:09:41Z","closed_at":"2020-09-01T16:08:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"29548dff6743fe541ee9b59cb615ec2e01109060","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29594/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29594/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29594/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/638bbf991d426dccd53a27999d66628f70fc76cd","head":{"label":"wzhfy:unify_assertEqualPlans_joinReorder","ref":"unify_assertEqualPlans_joinReorder","sha":"638bbf991d426dccd53a27999d66628f70fc76cd","user":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66051854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA1MTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"wzhfy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nOnly copy tags to node with no tags when transforming plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n@cloud-fan [made a good point](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29593#discussion_r482013121) that it doesn't make sense to append tags to existing nodes when nodes are removed. That will cause such bugs as duplicate rows when deduplicating and repartitioning by the same column with AQE.\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.range(10).union(spark.range(10)).createOrReplaceTempView(\"v1\")\r\nval df = spark.sql(\"select id from v1 group by id distribute by id\") \r\nprintln(df.collect().toArray.mkString(\",\"))\r\nprintln(df.queryExecution.executedPlan)\r\n\r\n// With AQE\r\n[4],[0],[3],[2],[1],[7],[6],[8],[5],[9],[4],[0],[3],[2],[1],[7],[6],[8],[5],[9]\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan(isFinalPlan=true)\r\n+- CustomShuffleReader local\r\n   +- ShuffleQueryStage 0\r\n      +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#183L, 10), true\r\n         +- *(3) HashAggregate(keys=[id#183L], functions=[], output=[id#183L])\r\n            +- Union\r\n               :- *(1) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=2)\r\n               +- *(2) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=2)\r\n\r\n// Without AQE\r\n[4],[7],[0],[6],[8],[3],[2],[5],[1],[9]\r\n*(4) HashAggregate(keys=[id#206L], functions=[], output=[id#206L])\r\n+- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#206L, 10), true\r\n   +- *(3) HashAggregate(keys=[id#206L], functions=[], output=[id#206L])\r\n      +- Union\r\n         :- *(1) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=2)\r\n         +- *(2) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's too expensive to detect node removal so we make a compromise only to copy tags to node with no tags.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.

This patch adds the support to work with struct columns.\r\n\r\nThe behavior before this PR:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> val df1 = spark.range(1).selectExpr(\"id c0\", \"named_struct('c', id + 1, 'b', id + 2, 'a', id + 3) c1\")\r\nscala> val df2 = spark.range(1).selectExpr(\"id c0\", \"named_struct('c', id + 1, 'b', id + 2) c1\")\r\nscala> df1.unionByName(df2, true).printSchema\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Union can only be performed on tables with the compatible column types. struct<c:bigint,b:bigint> <> struct<c:bigint,b:bigint,a:bigint> at the second column of the second table;;\r\n'Union false, false\r\n:- Project [id#0L AS c0#2L, named_struct(c, (id#0L + cast(1 as bigint)), b, (id#0L + cast(2 as bigint)), a, (id#0L + cast(3 as bigint))) AS c1#3]\r\n:  +- Range (0, 1, step=1, splits=Some(12))\r\n+- Project [c0#8L, c1#9]\r\n   +- Project [id#6L AS c0#8L, named_struct(c, (id#6L + cast(1 as bigint)), b, (id#6L + cast(2 as bigint))) AS c1#9]\r\n      +- Range (0, 1, step=1, splits=Some(12))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe behavior after this PR:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> df1.unionByName(df2, true).printSchema\r\nroot\r\n |-- c0: long (nullable = false)\r\n |-- c1: struct (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- a: long (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- b: long (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- c: long (nullable = false)\r\nscala> df1.unionByName(df2, true).show()\r\n+---+-------------+\r\n| c0|           c1|\r\n+---+-------------+\r\n|  0|    {3, 2, 1}|\r\n|  0|{ null, 2, 1}|\r\n+---+-------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe `allowMissingColumns` of `unionByName` is a feature allowing merging different schema from two datasets when unioning them together. Nested column support makes the feature more general and flexible for usage.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, after this change users can union two datasets with different schema with different structs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSome plan transformations (e.g., `RemoveNoopOperators`) implicitly assume the same `ExprId` refers to the unique attribute. But, `RuleExecutor` does not check this integrity between logical plan transformations. So, this PR intends to add this check in `isPlanIntegral` of `Analyzer`/`Optimizer`.\r\n\r\nThis PR comes from the talk with @cloud-fan @viirya in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29485#discussion_r475346278\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor better logical plan integrity checking.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor all three different aggregate physical operator: `HashAggregateExec`, `ObjectHashAggregateExec` and `SortAggregateExec`, they have same `outputPartitioning` and `requiredChildDistribution` logic. Refactor these same logic into their super class `BaseAggregateExec` to avoid code duplication and future bugs (similar to `HashJoin` and `ShuffledJoin`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nReduce duplicated code across classes and prevent future bugs if we only update one class but forget another. We already did similar refactoring for join (`HashJoin` and `ShuffledJoin`).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests as this is pure refactoring and no new logic added.","created_at":"2020-08-30T07:31:37Z","updated_at":"2020-08-31T16:39:11Z","closed_at":"2020-08-31T06:43:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"975a5029da172e01d5bbed50653b145ed65bd400","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29583/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29583/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29583/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/34e27c348e760529bc0582aa4dcfd12aba8db48e","head":{"label":"c21:aggregate-refactor","ref":"aggregate-refactor","sha":"34e27c348e760529bc0582aa4dcfd12aba8db48e","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nProcessing for `ThreadSafeRpcEndpoint` is controlled by  `numActiveThreads` in `Inbox`. Now if any fatal error happens during `Inbox.process`, `numActiveThreads` is not reduced. Then other threads can not process messages in that inbox, which causes the endpoint to \"hang\". For other type of endpoints, we also should keep  `numActiveThreads` correct.\r\n\r\nThis problem is more serious in previous Spark 2.x versions since the driver, executor and block manager endpoints are all thread safe endpoints.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we should reduce the number of active threads if fatal error happens in `Inbox.process`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`numActiveThreads` is not correct when fatal error happens and will cause the described problem.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new test.","created_at":"2020-08-30T04:32:39Z","updated_at":"2020-09-15T12:55:33Z","closed_at":"2020-09-15T06:46:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fbb5b86e28b89df58f10d0f857b49bff76207bf2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29580/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29580/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29580/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c279e9418b8a9274729932d8d8d3036699d52337","head":{"label":"wzhfy:deal_with_fatal_error","ref":"deal_with_fatal_error","sha":"c279e9418b8a9274729932d8d8d3036699d52337","user":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66051854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA1MTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"wzhfy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe motivation of this PR is to avoid caching the removed decommissioned executors in `TaskSchedulerImpl`. The cache is introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29422. The cache will hold the `isHostDecommissioned` info for a while. So if the task `FetchFailure` event comes after the executor loss event, `DAGScheduler` can still get the `isHostDecommissioned` from the cache and unregister the host shuffle map status when the host is decommissioned too.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to achieve the same goal without the cache. Instead of saving the `workerLost` in `ExecutorUpdated` / `ExecutorDecommissionInfo` / `ExecutorDecommissionState`, we could save the `hostOpt` directly. When the host is decommissioned or lost too, the `hostOpt` can be a specific host address. Otherwise, it's `None` to indicate that only the executor is decommissioned or lost.\r\n\r\nNow that we have the host info, we can also unregister the host shuffle map status when `executorLost` is triggered for the decommissioned executor.\r\n\r\nBesides, this PR also includes a few cleanups around the touched code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt helps to unregister the shuffle map status earlier for both decommission and normal executor lost cases.\r\n\r\nIt also saves memory in  `TaskSchedulerImpl` and simplifies the code a little bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR only refactor the code. The original behaviour should be covered by `DecommissionWorkerSuite`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently dstream.getOrCompute runs at JobGenerator, which has a single thread event loop.\r\nThis pull request moves that to JobScheduler.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSome of our spark applications have batch creation delay after running for some time. For instance, Batch 10:03 is submitted at 10:06. In spark UI, the latest batch doesn't match current time.\r\nWe observe such applications share a commonality that rdd actions exist in dstream.transfrom. Those actions will be executed in dstream.compute, which is called by JobGenerator. JobGenerator runs with a single thread event loop so any synchronized operations will block event processing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Reproduce\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// run this at Spark shell. Access Spark UI and check batch submission\r\nval lines = ssc.socketTextStream(\"localhost\", 9999)\r\nval words = lines.flatMap(_.split(\" \"))\r\nval mapped = words.transform(rdd => { Thread.sleep(10000); rdd; } )\r\nmapped.foreachRDD(rdd => rdd.foreach(x => println(x)))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// run this at Spark shell. Access Spark UI and look streaming output and associated jobs\r\nval lines = ssc.socketTextStream(\"localhost\", 9999)\r\nval words = lines.flatMap(_.split(\" \"))\r\nval mapped = words.transform(rdd => { val c=rdd.count(); rdd.map(x => s\"$c x\")} )\r\nmapped.foreachRDD(rdd => rdd.foreach(x => println(x)))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- For the batch submission delay issue,\r\nI created a test ForEachDStreamSuite to make sure batch execution doesn't block batch submission.\r\n- For Spark UI issue,\r\nI ran a streaming application and saw all jobs showing at batch page. A test JobSchedulerSuite is added to make sure all jobs in a batch can be associated with the BatchTime and display at Spark UI\r\n\r\n###

If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLooks at the resolving condition of `SetOperation`, it requires only each left data types should be `sameType` as the right ones. Logically the `EqualTo` expression in equi-join, also requires only left data type `sameType` as right data type. Then `HashJoin` requires left keys data type exactly the same as right keys data type, looks not reasonable.\r\n\r\nIt makes inconsistent results when doing `except` between two dataframes.\r\n\r\nIf two dataframes don't have nested fields, even their field nullable property different, `HashJoin` passes the key type check because it checks field individually so field nullable property is ignored.\r\n\r\nIf two dataframes have nested fields like struct, `HashJoin` fails the key type check because now it compare two struct types and nullable property now affects. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR changes key data types check in `HashJoin` to use `sameType`. This backports #29555 to branch-3.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLooks at the resolving condition of `SetOperation`, it requires only each left data types should be `sameType` as the right ones. Logically the `EqualTo` expression in equi-join, also requires only left data type `sameType` as right data type. Then `HashJoin` requires left keys data type exactly the same as right keys data type, looks not reasonable.\r\n\r\nIt makes inconsistent results when doing `except` between two dataframes.\r\n\r\nIf two dataframes don't have nested fields, even their field nullable property different, `HashJoin` passes the key type check because it checks field individually so field nullable property is ignored.\r\n\r\nIf two dataframes have nested fields like struct, `HashJoin` fails the key type check because now it compare two struct types and nullable property now affects. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Making consistent `except` operation between dataframes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSplitting tests originally posted in [PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29352) for SPARK-32531.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe added tests cover cases for maps and arrays of nested structs for different file formats. Eg, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29353 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29354 add object reuse when reading ORC and Avro files. However, for dynamic data structures like arrays and maps, we do not know just by looking at the schema what the size of the data structure will be so it has to be allocated when reading the data points. The added tests provide coverage so that objects are not accidentally reused when encountering maps and arrays.\r\n\r\nAFAIK this is not covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nbuild/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`CaseWhen` can be simplified to `If`, when there is only one case. This opimization was partially present in the `doGenCode` of `CaseWhen`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`If` has more potential optimization rules available than a complex `CaseWhen`. Optimization rules, that can work only on `If` and single-case `CaseWhen` do not have to handle these separately. For example #29567.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe following if clause:\r\n```sql\r\nif(p, null, false)\r\n```\r\ncan be simplified to:\r\n```sql\r\nand(p, null)\r\n```\r\nSimilarly, the clause:\r\n```sql\r\nif(p, null, true)\r\n```\r\ncan be simplified to\r\n```sql\r\nor(not(p), null)\r\n```\r\niff the predicate `p` is non-nullable, i.e., can be evaluated to either true or false, but not null.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nConverting if to or/and clauses can better push filters down.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2020-08-28T02:12:54Z","updated_at":"2020-09-01T02:54:37Z","closed_at":"2020-08-31T21:00:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"645295f5818b4781a59d4008c9e613c7ecced7f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29567/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29567/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29567/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/71bd033bfa58365ceabd108a791fd0748a27e1e0","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-32721","ref":"SPARK-32721","sha":"71bd033bfa58365ceabd108a791fd0748a27e1e0","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is followup from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29342, where to do two things:\r\n* Per https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29342#discussion_r470153323, change from java `HashSet` to spark in-house `OpenHashSet` to track matched rows for non-unique join keys. I checked `OpenHashSet` implementation which is built from a key index (`OpenHashSet._bitset` as `BitSet`) and key array (`OpenHashSet._data` as `Array`). Java `HashSet` is built from `HashMap`, which stores value in `Node` linked list and by theory should have taken more memory than `OpenHashSet`. Reran the same benchmark query used in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29342, and verified the query has similar performance here between `HashSet` and `OpenHashSet`.\r\n* Track metrics of the extra data structure `BitSet`/`OpenHashSet` for full outer SHJ. This depends on above thing, because there seems no easy way to get java `HashSet` memory size.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo better surface the memory usage for full outer SHJ more accurately.\r\nThis can help users/developers to debug/improve full outer SHJ.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future. \r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unite test in `SQLMetricsSuite.scala`

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, in cases like the following:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM t WHERE age < 40\r\n```\r\nwhere `age` is of short type, Spark won't be able to simplify this and can only generate filter `cast(age, int) < 40`. This won't get pushed down to datasources and therefore is not optimized.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a optimizer rule to improve this when the following constraints are satisfied:\r\n - input expression is binary comparisons when one side is a cast operation and another is a literal. \r\n - both the cast child expression and literal are of integral type (i.e., byte, short, int or long)\r\n\r\nWhen this is true, it tries to do several optimizations to either simplify the expression or move the cast to the literal side, so\r\nresult filter for the above case becomes `age < cast(40 as smallint)`. This is better since the cast can be optimized away later and the filter can be pushed down to data sources.\r\n\r\nThis PR follows a similar effort in Presto (https://prestosql.io/blog/2019/05/21/optimizing-the-casts-away.html). Here we only handles integral types but plan to extend to other types as follow-ups.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the previous section, when cast is not optimized, it cannot be pushed down to data sources which can lead\r\nto unnecessary IO and therefore longer job time and waste of resources. This helps to improve that.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests for both the optimizer rule and filter pushdown on datasource level for both Orc and

This change can make DataSourceV2's plan more optimized and reuse exchange as DataSourceV1 and parquet do.\r\n\r\nDirect reason: equals function of DataSourceV2ScanExec returns 'false' as comparing the same V2 scans(same table, outputs and pushedfilters)\r\n\r\nActual cause : With query plan's default doCanonicalize function, pushedfilters of DataSourceV2ScanExec are not canonicalized correctly.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add a specific `AQEOptimizer` for the `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec` instead of implementing an anonymous `RuleExecutor`. At the same time, this PR also adds the configuration `spark.sql.adaptive.optimizer.excludedRules`, which follows the same pattern of `Optimizer`, to make the `AQEOptimizer` more flexible for users and developers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec` has implemented an anonymous `RuleExecutor` to apply the AQE optimize rules on the plan. However, the anonymous class usually could be inconvenient to maintain and extend for the long term.   \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn TorrentBroadcast.scala\r\n```scala\r\nL133: if (!blockManager.putSingle(broadcastId, value, MEMORY_AND_DISK, tellMaster = false))\r\nL137: TorrentBroadcast.blockifyObject(value, blockSize, SparkEnv.get.serializer, compressionCodec)\r\nL147: if (!blockManager.putBytes(pieceId, bytes, MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER, tellMaster = true))\r\n```\r\nAfter the original value is saved successfully(TorrentBroadcast.scala: L133), but the following `blockifyObject()`(L137) or store piece(L147) steps are failed. There is no opportunity to release broadcast from memory.\r\n\r\nThis patch is to remove all pieces of the broadcast when failed to blockify or failed to store some pieces of a broadcast.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe use Spark thrift-server as a long-running service. A bad query submitted a heavy BroadcastNestLoopJoin operation and made driver full GC. We killed the bad query but we found the driver's memory usage was still high and full GCs were still frequent. By investigating with GC dump and log, we found the broadcast may memory leak.\r\n\r\n> 2020-08-19T18:54:02.824-0700: [Full GC (Allocation Failure)\r\n2020-08-19T18:54:02.824-0700: [Class Histogram (before full gc):\r\n116G->112G(170G), 184.9121920 secs]\r\n[Eden: 32.0M(7616.0M)->0.0B(8704.0M) Survivors: 1088.0M->0.0B Heap: 116.4G(170.0G)->112.9G(170.0G)], [Metaspace: 177285K->177270K(182272K)]\r\n1: 676531691 72035438432 [B\r\n2: 676502528 32472121344 org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.UnsafeRow\r\n3: 99551 12018117568 [Ljava.lang.Object;\r\n4: 26570 4349629040 [I\r\n5: 6 3264536688 [Lorg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.InternalRow;\r\n6: 1708819 256299456 [C\r\n7: 2338 179615208 [J\r\n8: 1703669 54517408 java.lang.String\r\n9: 103860 34896960 org.apache.spark.status.TaskDataWrapper\r\n10: 177396 25545024 java.net.URI\r\n...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually test.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support executor id placeholder in `spark.kubernetes.executor.volumes.persistentVolumeClaim.myname.options.claimName` configuration like the following.\r\n```\r\n--conf spark.kubernetes.executor.volumes.persistentVolumeClaim.spark-local-dir-1.options.claimName=pvc-spark-SPARK_EXECUTOR_ID \\\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is a convenient way to mount corresponding PV to the executor.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but this is a new feature and there is no regression because users don't use `SPARK_EXECUTOR_ID` in PVC claim name.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the newly added test

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR changes key data types check in `HashJoin` to use `sameType`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLooks at the resolving condition of `SetOperation`, it requires only each left data types should be `sameType` as the right ones. Logically the `EqualTo` expression in equi-join, also requires only left data type `sameType` as right data type. Then `HashJoin` requires left keys data type exactly the same as right keys data type, looks not reasonable.\r\n\r\nIt makes inconsistent results when doing `except` between two dataframes.\r\n\r\nIf two dataframes don't have nested fields, even their field nullable property different, `HashJoin` passes the key type check because it checks field individually so field nullable property is ignored.\r\n\r\nIf two dataframes have nested fields like struct, `HashJoin` fails the key type check because now it compare two struct types and nullable property now affects. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Making consistent `except` operation between dataframes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces the functionality of supporting file-based authenticate secret for the Mesos backend by using the available configs `spark.authenticate.secret.file`, `spark.authenticate.secret.driver.file` and `spark.authenticate.secret.executor.file`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPassing secrets in a file is more secure than passing secret as plain text.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a case in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFixed `CrossValidatorModel.copy()` so that it correctly calls `.copy()` on the models instead of lists of models.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`copy()` was first changed in #29445 . The issue was found in CI of #29524 and fixed. This PR introduces the exact same change so that `CrossValidatorModel.copy()` and its related tests are aligned in branch `master` and branch `branch-3.0`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated `test_copy` to make sure `copy()` is called on models instead of lists of models.","created_at":"2020-08-26T23:10:18Z","updated_at":"2020-08-28T17:18:07Z","closed_at":"2020-08-28T17:15:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"95aa089d0c1ed2419f2a958e8da33c6b94dd9503","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29553/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29553/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29553/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/844fe5c87fff19042e3abf84be590ce9deb0eac7","head":{"label":"Louiszr:fix-cv-copy","ref":"fix-cv-copy","sha":"844fe5c87fff19042e3abf84be590ce9deb0eac7","user":{"login":"Louiszr","id":19293269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjkzMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19293269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr","html_url":"https://github.com/Louiszr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":287130659,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODcxMzA2NTk=","name":"spark","full_name":"Louiszr/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Louiszr","id":19293269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjkzMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19293269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr","html_url":"https://github.com/Louiszr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Louiszr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Louiszr/spark","description":"Apache
