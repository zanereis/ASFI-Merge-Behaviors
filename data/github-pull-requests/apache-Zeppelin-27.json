What is this PR for?\r\nFixing ZEPPELIN-2382:\r\n\r\nA fresh install of Zeppelin 0.7.1 failed to start on a Windows due to the use of [getPosixFilePermissions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#getPosixFilePermissions(java.nio.file.Path,%20java.nio.file.LinkOption...))\r\n\r\nThis method fails on Windows with an UnsupportedOperationException - however, recovering (that is ignoring the exception) appears to have no negative effects. (For a discussion on this related to a different project see, e.g., https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-intellij/issues/937 )\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Have the binary distribution checked by the reporter of [ZEPPELIN-2382]\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2382\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nCheck if clean distribution runs on Windows.

What is this PR for?\r\nSecond travis job didn't work correctly. It suppose to test all core unit tests plus integration test (except for spark related test) but it was doing nothing.\r\n\r\nIt was because of the exclamation mark in **-Dtest** property:\r\n```\r\n-Dtest='!ZeppelinSparkClusterTest,!org.apache.zeppelin.spark.*'\r\n```\r\nwhich is not supported by maven-surefire-plugin of version 2.17 (which is used in Zeppelin). Exclamation mark is supported started from 2.19 but still does not work properly.\r\n\r\nI've added plugin **exclude** configuratin instead of **-Dtest** property.\r\n\r\nAfter travis job was restored I had found that not all core tests were working properly. I have excluded them from the travis job for now and created jira

implementation will deny the request if the Origin HTTP header is empty, even if the zeppelin.server.allowed.origins is *\r\n\r\nThis patch enables websocket requests without Origin in the HTTP header if the zeppelin.server.allowed.origins=*.

What is this PR for?\r\nDeletion of a notebook requires locking interpreterSettings. If the deletion is delayed , then lock is not released. At that point, we cannot run any notebook because everything is waiting to lock interpreterSettings.\r\nLooking at the code, there is no reason to lock the InterpreterSettings object in InterpreterSettingManager.removeNoteInterpreterSettingBinding.\r\nSimilarly in InterpreterSettingManager.getNoteInterpreterSettingBinding only interpreterSettingBinding is accessed and its already a thread safe object. So we can remove synchronization on InterpreterSettings\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2463\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nBeing a concurrency issue, it is difficult to test. \r\nPlease see the comments in the jira to see the issue experienced on a production zeppelin server.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? NO\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? NO\r\n* Does this needs documentation? NO\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-28T06:31:00Z","updated_at":"2017-05-15T15:06:27Z","closed_at":"2017-05-15T15:06:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2dd3e1733c16e3895a0baf3a186bd52b9d3289c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2296/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2296/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2296/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/6f28d74a0680367abab72204b80e49587566dd24","head":{"label":"benoyantony:ZEPPELIN-2463","ref":"ZEPPELIN-2463","sha":"6f28d74a0680367abab72204b80e49587566dd24","user":{"login":"benoyantony","id":1928906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg5MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1928906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony","html_url":"https://github.com/benoyantony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":87126626,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NzEyNjYyNg==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"benoyantony/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"benoyantony","id":1928906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg5MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1928906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony","html_url":"https://github.com/benoyantony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/benoyantony/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nDeletion of a notebook requires locking interpreterSettings. If the deletion is delayed , then lock is not released. At that point, we cannot run any notebook because everything is waiting to lock interpreterSettings.\r\nLooking at the code, there is no reason to lock the InterpreterSettings object in InterpreterSettingManager.removeNoteInterpreterSettingBinding.\r\nSimilarly in InterpreterSettingManager.getNoteInterpreterSettingBinding only interpreterSettingBinding is accessed and its already a thread safe object. So we can remove synchronization on InterpreterSettings\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2463\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nBeing a concurrency issue, it is difficult to test this.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? NO\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? NO\r\n* Does this needs documentation? NO\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-28T06:02:17Z","updated_at":"2017-04-28T06:11:00Z","closed_at":"2017-04-28T06:10:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2295/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2295/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2295/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/5fbe6d4cbd9cbf0581e5d303cd5e4005268c2c2a","head":{"label":"benoyantony:ZEPPELIN-2463","ref":"ZEPPELIN-2463","sha":"5fbe6d4cbd9cbf0581e5d303cd5e4005268c2c2a","user":{"login":"benoyantony","id":1928906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg5MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1928906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony","html_url":"https://github.com/benoyantony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":87126626,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NzEyNjYyNg==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"benoyantony/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"benoyantony","id":1928906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg5MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1928906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony","html_url":"https://github.com/benoyantony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoyantony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/benoyantony/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nAdd local winutils.exe in build and use as temporary HADOOP_HOME if required on run (windows only).\r\n\r\nThe build of the spark dependencies now downloads winutils.exe and installs it in interpreter/spark/winutils.\r\nThe zeppelin-env.cmd (only used if we run on windows) then checks if HADOOP_HOME exists, if not, it will set it to point to winutils. This is required to have the spark interpreter work in Windows.\r\n\r\nIn order to have this active, the zeppelin-env.cmd had to be removed from the .gitignore.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix | Improvement]\r\n\r\nWithout this fix, the binary distribution or a local build of Zeppelin will have the spark interpreter (default interpreter) fail on a Windows platform (unless the user follows additional / manual installation steps or already has a local HADOOP). This will frustrate users trying to checkout Zeppelin.\r\n\r\nFor users having HADOOP or macOS/Linux users, the chance will have no effect.\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2438\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n- Non-Regression Test\r\n- Standard Unit Test\r\n- Run Zeppelin without additional installations (except Java) on Windows\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nWe sometimes can not delete a note, or we will be accompanied by an NPE for deleting a note.\r\n\r\nThis problem occurs when:\r\nWhen interpreter.json 's note binding is wrong, or there is a problem.\r\nIf you are configuring an interpreter that is not through zeppelin's user interface.\r\nAs a result, it happens when synchronization of notes deletion and setting retention is not normal.\r\nTherefore, we should add handling for note deletion and exception handling for nonexistent interpreter bindings.\r\nIt reduces the synchronization problem of interpreter.json.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2431\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1. zeppelin stop\r\n2. edit con/interpreter.json and `interpreterBindings`\r\n  fix any notes or incorrect information.\r\n  for example \r\n  ```\r\n    },  \r\n  \"interpreterBindings\": {\r\n    \"2CFS9YSM5\": [\r\n      \"2CFRR1D3TINVALIDINVALIDINVALID\", <-- edit\r\n      \"2CFZ1JKUR\",\r\n      \"2CEAJK1VW\",\r\n      \"2CGSESWBH\",\r\n      \"2CERNPGW5\",\r\n   }\r\n  ```\r\n3. zeppelin start\r\n4. You can try remove invalid interpreter bind note on web. (on example = `2CFS9YSM5`)\r\n\r\nresult : \r\nIf the modifications to this PR are not reflected,\r\nIt will not be deleted or an error will appear on the server.\r\nAlso, the interpreterBindings information in interpreter.json does not respond to delete events.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nproblem

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nHide navbar and noteAction bar when scrolling down to \r\n\r\n- **widen view area**\r\n\r\nHere are few famous services which hiding their navbar too.\r\n\r\n- https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic\r\n- http://github.com/tj (profile page)\r\n\r\n### Implementation Details\r\n\r\nSince [headroom](wicky.nillia.ms/headroom.js/) functionality makes integration tests fail,\r\nwe can't use `headroom` for CI build. to resolve this issue, \r\n\r\n- created new maven profiles: `web-ci` and `web-dist` (default)\r\n- maven will execute `yarn run build:ci` with the `web-ci` profile which doesn't include headroom in `app.js`\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Add headroom.js\r\n* [x] - Filter out useless dependencies\r\n* [x] - Apply headroom.js\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2427](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2427)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n1. Open Zeppelin\r\n2. Scroll down, up to see whether navbar and note action bar are hided or not.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n![2427](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4968473/25214004/afae7a1c-25cf-11e7-9ee1-f41e767d2039.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need

What is this PR for?\r\nWhen `interpreter.close()` occurs in code it shuts down _RemoteInterpreterEventPoller_ and then tries to close thrift connection.

All the things are in `Input.java`, this is hard to add new controls, this PR is for refactoring Input to make dynamic forms extensible.  Main Changes:\r\n* Make `Input` as the base class of dynamic forms also use it as the factory class\r\n* All the concret dynamic forms extend `Input`\r\n* Add method `toJson` and `fromJson` for `GUI` for `GUI`'s serialization/deserialization. I plan to do it for other classes as well, so that we can remove duplicated serde code and also make it easy to test serialization/deserialization\r\n* Change `z.input` to `z.textbox` as I think z.input is a little misleading. But I still keep `z.input` and make `z.input` as deprecated.  \r\n* Ideally the new input forms' json should be the same as the old input form json. But there's one bug in the old input form, `type` is missing if the input forms are created in frontend for textbox and select. So I keep the old input forms for compatibility. I will load the old input forms json and convert it into new input forms, and after saving, `note.json` would have the new input forms json.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, user needs to do 3 things to add new ui controls\r\n* Implement its UI control classes, (refer TextBox/CheckBox/Select), and specify it in `TypeAdapterFactory` of `Input` for serde.\r\n* Add parsing logic in `Input.getInputForm` if you want to support this control in frontend.\r\n* Add display logic in `paragraph-parameterizedQueryForm.html`\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[ Improvement | Refactoring]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2395\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nTest is added\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR is for a showing dialog when note's permission set `Readers/Writers` but `Owners` is empty. \r\nCurrently, after merged #849, if user set `Owners` is empty, it's automatically set as the current user.\r\nSo, It would be better to show a dialog before `Owners` is fill with the current user because user might think it is not intended. \r\n\r\nPlus, if a user only set `Readers` role, all field(`Writers` and `Owners`) role is filled as the current user like below.

What is this PR for?\r\nWe need to add an ability of adding custom _Paragraph_ to a _Note_. This will make it easier to write _Note_ and _Paragraph_ tests. At the moment all paragraphs are created inside _Note_ class.\r\n\r\nThis refactoring will allow to write a test for [ZEPPELIN-1856](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1856) issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Refactoring]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Rename `addParagraph()` -> `addNewParagraph()` and `insertParagraph()` -> `insertNewParagraph()`. These names will describe what mathods do: create new paragraph and add it to the note.\r\n* [x] - Remove duplicated code from `addNewParagraph()` and `insertNewParagraph()` methods.\r\n* [x] - Add methods `addParagraph()` and `insertParagraph()`, which receive a _Paragraph_ instance in parameters and add it to the _Note_.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? **no**\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? **no**\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\nThe Cancel functionality for the Livy interpreter has few issues. One issue is because a variable is not published correctly. Second issue is observed when  there is a delay in launching the application. Any cancel before application launch is ignored.  The third issue is that Cancel is not correctly implemented for SparkSQLInterpreter.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2355\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nThe test cases are modified to test the changes.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?  No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

I think it's make senses to add a configuration item to disable this behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN/\r\n* Put link here, and add [ZEPPELIN-*Jira number*] in PR title, eg. [ZEPPELIN-533]\r\n\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2353] (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2353)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nOutline the steps to test the PR here.\r\n\r\nwhen we have kerberos

Build source with below command\r\n```\r\nmvn clean package -DskipTests -pl 'zeppelin-interpreter, zeppelin-zengine, zeppelin-server, zeppelin-display, spark, spark-dependencies'\r\n\r\n```\r\nAftr this step, there will be `R` dir under `ZEPPELIN_HOME/interpreter/spark`. Before this PR, only `dep` dir and `zeppelin-spark_2.10-0.8.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` is generated without `-Psparkr` build profile.\r\n\r\n4. Restart Zeppelin. To make sure, run R tutorial note under `Zeppelin Tutorial` folder\r\n\r\nIt should be run successfully without any error\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nIf we build without `-Psparkr`  \r\n- before : R related properties are not activated by default in Spark interpreter \r\n![screen shot 2017-04-03 at 4 31 49

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrently users who build Zeppelin from source need to include `-Ppyspark` to use `%pyspark` with embedded local Spark. But it's quite inconvenient to write this build profile every time we build i think. So I removed `-Ppyspark` and make pyspark related libraries automatically downloaded when we build Zeppelin. \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - remove the rest of `-Ppyspark` build profile in `dev/create_release.sh`, `dev/publish_release.sh`, and `docs/install/build.md` after getting feedback\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2298](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2298)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1. Apply this patch\r\n2. Build source with below command\r\n```\r\nmvn clean package -DskipTests -pl 'zeppelin-interpreter, zeppelin-zengine, zeppelin-server, zeppelin-display, spark, spark-dependencies'\r\n\r\n```\r\nAftr this step, there will be `pyspark` dir under `ZEPPELIN_HOME/interpreter/spark`. Before this PR, only `dep` dir and `zeppelin-spark_2.10-0.8.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` is generated without `-Ppyspark` build profile.\r\n\r\n4. Restart Zeppelin. To make sure, run any python code e.g. \r\n```\r\n%pyspark\r\nprint(\"Hello \"+z.input(\"name\"))\r\n``` \r\nIt should be run successfully without any error\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n tl;dr Without `-Ppyspark` profile\r\n - Before\r\n<img width=\"856\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-04-02 at 2 50 57 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/24584778/0e8ec6b0-17b4-11e7-9f0d-f2599fd7bd63.png\">\r\n \r\n - After\r\n<img width=\"893\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-04-02 at 2 28 21 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/24584779/10b7ed68-17b4-11e7-90d4-aa95eb9bba2d.png\">\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation? no\r\n\r\nI want to include `SparkR` by default(= remove `-PsparkR` build profile) like this as a next step. I want to ask how Zeppelin community think about

What is this PR for?\r\nAs the number of Helium packages is increasing, more pagination buttons will be generated accordingly. If we don't set `maxSize`, pagination layout will be broken when screen size is small. So I set the `maxSize` to 5 to prevent it.\r\nAnd also hided unnecessary arrows when current page is on first & last.

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrently \"see more\" is placed next to the older version of INTERPRETER type of Helium pkg. But other type of Helium pkg(e.g. SPELL or VISUALIZATION) has \"enable\". And if we click \"enable\", can see the dialog for asking if you want to enable the package or not. So I changed INTERPRETER type pkg's \"see more\" to \"enable\" for the consistency in this patch.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2339](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2339)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n1. Run Zeppelin web under `zeppelin-web` with \r\n```\r\n$ yarn run dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Go to Helium menu and click any interpreter type of package\r\n3. Click `versions` \r\n4. there should be \"enable\" not \"see more\"\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n -

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nBundle helium packages one by one because\r\n\r\n#### Summary\r\n\r\nLet's say you have one helium package called `ultimate-line-chart`.\r\n\r\n**1. Package Path**\r\n\r\n- **(before)** `$ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-repo/helium-bundles/node_modules/ultimate-line-chart`\r\n- **(after)** `$ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-repo/helium-bundles/bundles/ultimate-line-chart`\r\n\r\n**2. Zeppelin Local Module Path**\r\n\r\n- **(before)** `$ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-repo/helium-bundles/node_modules/zeppelin-tabledata`\r\n- **(after)** `$ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-repo/helium-bundles/local_modules/zeppelin-tabledata`\r\n\r\n**3. Bundle Cache Path**\r\n\r\n- **(before)** `$ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-repo/helium-bundles/helium.bundle.cache.js` (mixed one)\r\n- **(after)** `$ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-repo/helium-bundles/bundles/ultimate-line-chart/helium.bundle.cache.js` (for each helium package)\r\n\r\n#### Details\r\n\r\n- Bundling them in one file is not good idea because the whole bundling is broken when only 1 bundle fails\r\n- Some node packages might not installed correctly. For example, `amchart/amcharts3` will be installed in `helium-bundles/node_modules/my-helium-vis/node_modules` but `amchart-export` will be placed in `helium-bundles/node_modules` so `my-helium-vis` can't import `amchart-export`. (This is real case)\r\n- Additionally, I used yarn to install required node_modules. separated bundling requires install same dependencies multiple times. This takes more time than before and npm is too slow to install them all.\r\n- Install Zeppelin framework modules using [local path](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#local-paths). It's more safe and correct way to install local modules.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\nNONE\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2088](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2088)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n1. Install any local helium package\r\n2. Install any online helium package\r\n3. Use them\r\n4. Disable\r\n5. Test `npm run dev:helium`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\nNONE\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? - NO\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? - NO\r\n* Does this needs documentation? - NO\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-31T14:14:48Z","updated_at":"2017-04-08T22:48:59Z","closed_at":"2017-04-08T22:48:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"232d337f68225031d739404b788420b6b3827a8c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2210/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2210/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2210/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/bea6c09bd32e51e26de75ce8f561279b43e386fb","head":{"label":"1ambda:ZEPPELIN-2088/evaluate-helium-bundle-one-by-one","ref":"ZEPPELIN-2088/evaluate-helium-bundle-one-by-one","sha":"bea6c09bd32e51e26de75ce8f561279b43e386fb","user":{"login":"1ambda","id":4968473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4968473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda","html_url":"https://github.com/1ambda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66360806,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjM2MDgwNg==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"1ambda/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"1ambda","id":4968473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4968473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda","html_url":"https://github.com/1ambda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/1ambda/zeppelin","description":"Mirror
