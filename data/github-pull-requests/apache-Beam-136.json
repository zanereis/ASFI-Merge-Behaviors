original System.err\r\n\r\nCurrently such errors are logged to System.err which is a PrintStream that\r\npublishes to the handler.  This is perhaps unlikely to work if earlier publishing\r\nfailed and additionally removes a potential deadlock between the PrintStream\r\nobject sychronization and the Handler object synchronization. This was attempted\r\nto be fixed earlier by dissallowing the PrintStream object to be synchronized\r\nwhen calling into the handler.  However this is possible to be triggered by\r\nexternal synchronization on the PrintStream, such as that performed by\r\nThrowable.printStackTrace. Changing the PrintStream to use separate synchronization\r\nfor buffering works in most cases but not for cases where the stream is externally\r\nsynchronized.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

an `@SchemaCaseFormat` annotation that can be used to control the case format used in schema field names. For example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@DefaultSchema(JavaFieldSchema.class)\r\n@SchemaCaseFormat(CaseFormat.LOWER_UNDERSCORE)\r\nclass MyClass {\r\n   public String user;\r\n   public int ageInYears;\r\n   @SchemaCaseFormat(CaseFormat.UPPER_CAMEL)\r\n   public boolean knowsJavascript;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill produce a schema with fields \"user\", \"age_in_years\", and \"KnowsJavascript\".\r\n\r\nI think the primary application of this will be using `lower_underscore` for schemas that will be used across languages (e.g. in LogicalType base types, and cross-language transform configuration objects), but I figured a general purpose solution based on [`CaseFormat`](https://guava.dev/releases/23.0/api/docs/com/google/common/base/CaseFormat.html) would be more valuable.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests

Added 2 show API options in the side panel: duration and n.\r\n2. Added an `apply` button to alter the behavior of setting show API\r\n   options: now the configuration change only takes effect after\r\n   clicking the button; previously, the configuration is automatically\r\n   applied when clicking a checkbox, but this behavior does not apply\r\n   when the configuration now has text inputs.\r\n3. Added `interruptKernelIfNotDone` to the InspectableViewModel and\r\n   always execute it when querying the kernel from such model. This made\r\n   switching selected item and applying new show API options very\r\n   snappy.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/ecedd3e654352f1b51ab2caae0fd4665403bd0eb/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/WriteTables.java#L205-L210\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/ecedd3e654352f1b51ab2caae0fd4665403bd0eb/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/WriteRename.java#L145-L148\r\nBefore actually triggering BQ load, BatchLoads groups all temporary files by a singleton key.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/ecedd3e654352f1b51ab2caae0fd4665403bd0eb/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/BatchLoads.java#L308-L313\r\n\r\nThis can be problematic when using [DynamicDestinations](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/ecedd3e654352f1b51ab2caae0fd4665403bd0eb/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/DynamicDestinations.java) in a streaming pipeline with triggers. Sometimes users would like to create tables in the middle of the pipeline based on the data or time. Because of the `GroupOntoSingleton`, different BQ destinations are grouped under the same key (always `Void`) and everything is under a [global window](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/ecedd3e654352f1b51ab2caae0fd4665403bd0eb/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/BatchLoads.java#L275-L297), therefore the pane index is always incremental and new tables won't be created even though users have specified `CreateDisposition = CREATE_IF_NEEDED`\r\n\r\nProposed Solution: Instead of grouping everything into a singleton, grouping by Bigquery destinations so that new destinations can have a pane with index == 0. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

these commits I have done the following:\r\n1. Update the vendored calcite build to version 1.25\r\n1. Use that new Calcite version in Beam.\r\n1. Attempt (!!) to fix all the changes that have occurred in Calcite over the last year.\r\n\r\nTo test this I have run these to install the new calcite locally \r\n```\r\n./gradlew -p vendor/calcite-1_25_0  check\r\n./gradlew -p vendor/calcite-1_25_0  -PvendoredDependenciesOnly  publishToMavenLocal \r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrent state of this initial pull request:\r\n1. WORK IN PROGRESS. And I have currently reached the boundaries of my knowledge of this part of the system. Help is needed.\r\n1. It probably won't build in CI because the vendored Calcite has not yet been released.\r\n1. There are lots of changes that I did to make it compile that I'm not sure are correct. My current knowledge of this is too limited at this time.\r\n1. If I run this locally (i.e. ./gradlew build -p sdks/java/extensions/sql/  ) it all builds and about 10% of the tests fail (i.e. about 90% pass)\r\n\r\nR:@amaliujia\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

ReadFromBigQuery to use a user pre-configured dataset for the temporary dataset.\r\nUsing a DatasetReference will also allow for cross project temporary dataset configuration.\r\n\r\nThere are some uses cases that require temporary datasets created when using beam.io.BigQuerySource to be in a different GCP project (e.g service account permissions, billing).\r\n\r\nWe could make the project where temporary datasets configurable, so that the temp dataset is created in a user specified project. Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\npipeline = p | \"Read from BQ source\" >> beam.io.ReadFromBigQuery(\r\n      query=q,\r\n      use_standard_sql=True,\r\n      project='frankzhao-test-project',\r\n      temp_dataset=bigquery.DatasetReference(\r\n          projectId='bigquery-project', datasetId='bq_temp'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the temp_dataset option to allow user configuration of the temporary dataset location when using ReadFromBigQuery, which defaults to the execution project. A DatasetReference is used to allow for the dataset location to be in a different project (BEAM-10859).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

going through the programming guide, I found two small things that can be improved.\r\n\r\nFirst is in the [Windowing with bounded PCollections](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#windowing-bounded-collections) section. The description mentions reading using `TextIO` but the images display reading from a database table via Kafka IO.\r\n\r\nI've updated both diagrams (there's also a slight change in the text) to better reflect the content in the section.\r\n\r\nHere's the \"unwindowed\" before & after:\r\n<img width=\"1170\" alt=\"unwindowed-before\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/184055/94370803-9f964880-00e1-11eb-893c-1517f07cfe5e.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1176\" alt=\"unwindowed-after\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/184055/94370806-a329cf80-00e1-11eb-8b5f-0f3c2ba9d193.png\">\r\n\r\nHere's the \"windowing\" before & after:\r\n<img width=\"1185\" alt=\"windowing-before\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/184055/94370822-be94da80-00e1-11eb-8e93-95f44ca93afb.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1193\" alt=\"windowing-after\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/184055/94370828-c05e9e00-00e1-11eb-99b8-ffbe1febf70b.png\">\r\n\r\nThe second change is a minor one in the [Setting a trigger](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#setting-a-trigger) section. The python example uses a code snippet from a test suite, but it is wrong with regards to the text - the text (and the Java snippet) use a one minute `afterProcessing` trigger whereas the incorrect snippet uses a 10 minute trigget (`10 * 60`). I've copy-pasted the whole code snippet and removed the now obsolete commands from the test suite.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds bundle finalization support to streaming portable Flink by hooking up with Flink checkpoint. \r\nI also looked into batch support but found out that Flink batch doesn't expose an API like checkpoint:\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r89c74f4020cd15d3c1a4b84ef78d7da4f67824e1b5e2210f4c5c1f40%40%3Cdev.flink.apache.org%3E.\r\nFor now, the streaming support is enough to support streaming SDF usage, which is also a major usage for x-lang.\r\n\r\n\r\nr: @mxm \r\ncc: @lukecwik @ibzib \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

   After upgrading to Gradle 6.6.1 (commit\r\n    1db383c58c214ec2e10edec72e7fc427c74ebb1c) the snapshot builds started\r\n    failing. This is because the maven plugin now publishes Maven 3\r\n    metadata, where previously it published Maven 2 metadata. From the\r\n    userguide [1]:\r\n    \r\n    The Maven Plugin used to publish the highly outdated Maven 2 metadata format. This has\r\n    been changed and it will now publish Maven 3 metadata, just like the Maven Publish Plugin.\r\n    With the removal of Maven 2 support, the methods that configure unique snapshot behavior\r\n    have also been removed. Maven 3 only supports unique snapshots, so we decided to remove\r\n    them.\r\n    \r\n    [1]: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.pdf\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

discussed over Dev mail, a very common use case in Dataflow / Beam is reading from multiple PubSub topics/subscriptions and flatten them out. \r\n\r\nThe PR adds the PTransform to do so.\r\n\r\nIt takes two parameters:\r\n- `source_list`: List of topics/subscriptions.\r\n- `with_context`: option to return a key-value pair of the form (source, actual message)\r\n\r\nOther options from `ReadFromPubSub` can also be included as `kwargs` except `topic` or `subscription`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
