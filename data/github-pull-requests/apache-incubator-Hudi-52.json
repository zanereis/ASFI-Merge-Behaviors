What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nAims to resolve the following bugs in AWS Glue Meta Sync post schema evolution.\r\n\r\n### Bugs\r\n* CreateTable filters out the partition column but updating the table doesn't filter the schema which leads to having duplicate columns and incompatible metadata in Glue.\r\n* Table properties not getting updated when the schema changes because of the incorrect `nonEmpty` predicate.\r\n* Update table parameters function overrides the `EXTERNAL` and `last_commit_time_sync` causing to reload all the partitions.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n* Separates `getColumnsFromSchema` logic into a method that provides common functionality to get the columns in a consistent manner for both creating and updating tables (Excluding partition columns).\r\n* Replaces `nonEmpty(tableProperties)` with `isNullOrEmpty(tableProperties)` to make sure tableProperties are updated during schema updates unless if it is null or empty.\r\n* `updateTableProperties` now doesn't replace table parameters to ensure that `EXTERNAL` and `last_commit_time_sync` properties are not lost during schema updates.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running the sync job for creation / updation of tables.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x]

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdd separate control for Flink compaction operation sync/async mode.\r\n\r\nDetails in https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/HUDI/issues/HUDI-4329\r\n\r\n#### Problem Review\r\nThe compact operation sync/async in CompactionFunction is now controlled by FlinkOptions#COMPACTION_ASYNC_ENABLED\r\n```java\r\n  public CompactFunction(Configuration conf) {\r\n    this.conf = conf;\r\n    this.asyncCompaction = StreamerUtil.needsAsyncCompaction(conf);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nWhile in fact it cannot be switched to sync mode because the pipeline defined by sync compaction will only include the clean but not compact operators.\r\n```java\r\n  // compaction\r\n  if (StreamerUtil.needsAsyncCompaction(conf)) {\r\n    return Pipelines.compact(conf, pipeline);\r\n  } else {\r\n    return Pipelines.clean(conf, pipeline);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n#### Improvement\r\nAdd another separate control switch for compaction operation sync/async mode.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nadd sync compaction switch for MoR compaction.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nAdd `compaction.operation.async.enabled`: used to turn on the synchronous compaction operation\r\n\r\nThe original `compaction.async.enabled`: used to turn on the compaction process.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-28T06:23:06Z","updated_at":"2024-03-26T01:28:24Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719802999,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAyOTk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:major","name":"priority:major","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":"degraded

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to let Hudi external config support Spark cluster mode. In Spark cluster mode, the Spark driver would run on a random node within the cluster. Hudi external config file only exists in the master node and this would cause a file not found issue when the Spark driver is not running on the master node.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, when loading the external config file, it would first try to load the hudi-defaults.conf from the class loader. To add hudi-defaults.conf to the Spark class loader, similar to hive-site.xml, we can add hudi-defaults.conf through spark.yarn.dist.files option.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n(or)\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end.*\r\n  - *Added HoodieClientWriteTest to verify the change.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job locally.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFix TestHoodieSparkSqlWriter.testSchemaEvolutionForTableType failed random\r\nthe reason for it is that:\r\n1）when we use glob path to read hudi table (like spark.read.format(\"hudi\").load(\"/tmp/tableName///*\")). spark will infer parquet schema auto,\r\n2）when evolution happen, hoodie table may exist different schema parquet files, spark choose a parquet file randomly to infer schema\r\n3）once spark choose a old parquet file，an old schema will be used which is wrong.\r\n\r\nTherefore we should specify the schema to the latest commit schema since the table schema evolution.\r\n*(For example: This pull request adds quick-start document.)*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nCurrently after #4253 no matter whether the user specified it explicitly or was relying on a default value this config value will be overridden (ie potentially reverting what have been specified by the user). As such, there's no way presently to enforce this config on the write side if your schema contains `DecimalType` fitting into the range. \r\n\r\nInstead the behavior should be to only override _default_ config value in cases when there's a `DecimalType` of expected range, and if this config have been specified by the user -- it should not be overridden.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Fixed sequence determining whether Parquet's legacy-format writing property should be overridden to only kick in when it has not been explicitly specified by the caller;\r\n - Fixed tests\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the `HoodieCleaner` utility so that errors will propagate to spark + YARN (or whatever RM you are using). \r\n\r\nCurrently, if the cleaner fails for any reason the application status (in YARN) is not set to `FAILED`. When running the cleaner outside of the write process (such as DeltaStreamer) this result in a job that cannot be tracked by the coordinating system. We are using Apache Airflow to run the cleaner in parallel on our tables. If the cleaner fails, we need the application status to be set to `FAILED` so that the airflow sensor for the job can alert us. \r\n\r\nThere was an [old issue and PR](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1749) created to catch all cleaner errors and log them. According to the ticket, the change was done because the cleaner process was hanging during certain scenarios. I have not been able to reproduce this behavior. There is no information about the environment on the ticket (possibly only occurred under spark 2.x?)\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- AWS EMR: `emr-6.3.1`\r\n- Spark Version: 3.1.1\r\n- Hadoop Distribution: `Amazon 3.2.1`\r\n- Hudi Version: `0.10.1`\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify HoodieCleaner.java to remove try/catch block*\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI tested this change manually for both passing and failing scenarios. To create an error scenario, I tried to clean a table in AWS S3 where the IAM role would not allow the cleaner to modify the bucket. This resulted in a 403-Forbidden exception from the S3 client, which bubbled up to the cleaner utility. \r\n\r\nSuccessful runs finish, the spark context is shut down, and YARN reports a successful application run.\r\n\r\nFor failed runs (where `HoodieCleaner::run` throws an exception) the exception is bubbled up to spark where it is handled, logged, the spark context is shut down, and YARN correctly reports a failed status for the application run. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [x] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWhen we define a table in Hive with a partitioning column, all NULL values within that column appear as `__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__`. It is the sentinel value which is understood by both Hive and Spark. Previously we used `default` string as the default partition value. That would result in casting errors as mentioned in HUDI-4303 or HUDI-4159. This PR fixes that behavior.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - Change default partition value to `__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__`.\r\n  - Fix tests.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFix TestHoodieSparkSqlWriter.testSchemaEvolutionForTableType failed random\r\nthe reason for it is that:\r\n1）when we use glob path to read hudi table (like spark.read.format(\"hudi\").load(\"/tmp/tableName/*/*/*\")).   spark will infer parquet schema auto,\r\n2）when evolution happen,  hoodie table may exist different schema parquet files,  spark choose a parquet file  randomly to infer schema\r\n3）once spark choose a old parquet file，an old schema will be used which is wrong.\r\n\r\nTherefore  we should specify the schema to the latest commit schema since the table schema evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThe fs view API `fetchLatestBaseFiles` is being used in presto-hive connector and it did not filter out clustered filegroups so the query would have duplicates in result. This PR fixes that behavior.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Filter out replaced (clustered) file groups in `fetchLatestBaseFiles`\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n  - Improved an existing UT to cover this API.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis test flakes only when bootstrap base files cleaning is also enabled. The test data has two partitions and clean planner tries to find eligible files for cleaning with parallelism defined by `Math.min(#partitions, config#CLEANER_PARALLELISM_VALUE)`, in this case it becomes two. But, from the logs it appears as though once in a while, an executor is lost and hence the plan does not have an eligible file for one of the partitions. In order to fix the flakiness, this PR does two things:\r\n- Separate out the cleaner test with bootstrap base file cleaning to a separate UT, instead of a parameterized test.\r\n- Set cleaner parallelism to 1 for more predictability.\r\n\r\nExecutor log for a successful run:\r\n```\r\n48634 [Executor task launch worker for task 33] WARN  org.apache.hudi.table.action.clean.CleanPlanner  -

purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request adds quick-start document.)*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThe max parquet write file size is: `compression_ratio * max_file_size`.\r\n\r\nThe original implementation uses `max_file_size + compression_ratio * max_file_size`, which is not consistent with spark writer.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nThe issue is each time when Hudi upserts records, it would sync to the catalog and update last_commit_time_sync for the Glue table. Each time it updates this property, Glue by default would create a new table version and archive old versions. So the problem is if customers update the Hudi table frequently, eventually they would hit the Glue table version limit.\r\n\r\nSo here inside Hudi, we pass a parameter `skipGlueArchive` to the environment context to finally pass it to AWS Glue metadata service, so AWS Glue client has an option to decide whether to skip archive or not.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n

it is reasonable to remove this parameter\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull

instanceTime string is too short, it may appear in the file name.\r\n\r\nIt's not easy to reproduce, this is the log I copy from Jira.\r\n```\r\n2022-03-29T01:30:26.3550882Z

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFor the binary or byte array field, there is a difference in generating the actual record between Avro 1.8.2 and 1.10.2.  Specifically, for the test record generated by `HoodieTestDataGenerator`, Avro 1.8.2 generates `\"nation\":{\"bytes\":\"Canada\"}` while Avro 1.10.2 generates `\"nation\":\"Canada\"`.  Note that Spark 2.4 and 3.1 profiles (previously supported, removed on master now) rely on Avro 1.8.2 and Spark 3.3+ profile rely on Avro 1.10.2.\r\n\r\nSince `TestCOWDataSourceStorage` uses `nation.bytes` for testing the nest field for constructing record key, this does not work for running the tests on Spark 3.3+ profile, causing the test to fail (Note that `TestCOWDataSourceStorage#testCopyOnWriteStorage` does not fail on master with Spark 3.3+ due to HUDI-8183 which will be fixed separately).\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the tests in `TestCOWDataSourceStorage` to use a different nested field `fare.currency` for the nest field usage for record key instead of relying on `nation.bytes` which is Avro version dependent.\r\n\r\n###
