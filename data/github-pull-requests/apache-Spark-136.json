What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`Groupby._reduce_for_stat_function` is a common helper function leveraged by multiple statistical functions of GroupBy objects.\r\n\r\nIt defines parameters `only_numeric` and `bool_as_numeric` to control accepted Spark types.\r\n\r\nTo be consistent with pandas API, we may also have to introduce `str_as_numeric` for `sum` for example.\r\n\r\nInstead of introducing parameters designated for each Spark type, the PR is proposed to introduce a parameter `accepted_spark_types` to specify accepted types of Spark columns to be aggregated.\r\n\r\nThat makes the helper function more extensible and clearer.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve code extensibility and readability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs a syntax guard for downstream datasource that could handle empty schema, we enforce user to use `()` during table creation queries.\r\n\r\nE.g. `CREATE TABLE table () USING parquet`.\r\n\r\nNote that the `[CREATE OR] REPLACE` is excluded from this change due to additional complexity.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo explicitly make sure user are aware that they are creating a table with no columns.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nExisting code that calls `CREATE TABLE table USING ...` will fail. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdds 3 new syntactic sugar overloads to Dataset's join method as proposed in [SPARK-35739](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35739).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImproved development experience for developers using Spark SQL, specifically when coding in Java.  \r\n\r\nPrior to changes the Seq overloads required developers to use less-known Java-to-Scala converter methods that made code less readable.  The overloads internalize those converter calls for two of the new methods and the third method adds a single-item overload that is useful for both Java and Scala.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the three new overloads technically constitute an API change to the Dataset class.  These overloads are net-new and have been commented appropriately in line with the existing methods.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest cases were not added because it is unclear to me where/how syntactic sugar overloads fit into the testing suites (if at all).  Happy to add them if I can be pointed in the correct direction.\r\n\r\n* Changes were tested in Scala via spark-shell.\r\n* Changes were tested in Java by modifying an example:\r\n  ```\r\n  diff

of #36230\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange `EliminateOuterJoin#canFilterOutNull` to return `false` when a `where` condition throws an exception.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nConsider this query:\r\n```\r\nselect *\r\nfrom (select id, id as b from range(0, 10)) l\r\nleft outer join (select id, id + 1 as c from range(0, 10)) r\r\non l.id = r.id\r\nwhere assert_true(c > 0) is null;\r\n```\r\nThe query should succeed, but instead fails with\r\n```\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: '(c#1L > cast(0 as bigint))' is not true!\r\n```\r\nThis happens even though there is no row where `c > 0` is false.\r\n\r\nThe `EliminateOuterJoin` rule checks if it can convert the outer join to a inner join based on the expression in the where clause, which in this case is\r\n```\r\nassert_true(c > 0) is null\r\n```\r\n`EliminateOuterJoin#canFilterOutNull` evaluates that expression with `c` set to `null` to see if the result is `null` or `false`. That rule doesn't expect the result to be a `RuntimeException`, but in this case it always is.\r\n\r\nThat is, the assertion is failing during optimization, not at run time.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test.","created_at":"2022-04-25T15:45:30Z","updated_at":"2022-08-10T18:12:41Z","closed_at":"2022-04-27T07:40:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bf3e0a2a4af9b1c67cae855ebd131845a46fdd00","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36341/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36341/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36341/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9104d859a152f6d268bd96bdd206292259a5dcee","head":{"label":"bersprockets:outer_join_eval_assert_issue_32","ref":"outer_join_eval_assert_issue_32","sha":"9104d859a152f6d268bd96bdd206292259a5dcee","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWrap SQL configs in error messages by double quotes. Added the `toSQLConf()` method to `QueryErrorsBase` to invoke it from `Query.*Errors`.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36335.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To highlight types and make them more visible for users.\r\n2. To be able to easily parse types from error text.\r\n3. To be consistent to other outputs of identifiers, sql statement and etc. where Spark uses quotes or ticks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it changes user-facing error messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly *QueryExecutionAnsiErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Max Gekk

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to have a single author as ASF for Apache Spark project since the project is being maintained under this organization.\r\n\r\nFor `pom.xml`, I referred to Hadoop https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/56cfd6061770872ce35cf815544b0c0f49613209/pom.xml#L76-L79\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe mention several original developers in authors in `pom.xml` or `R/pkg/DESRIPTION` while the project is being maintained under ASF organization.\r\n\r\nIn addition, seems like these people (at least

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWrap SQL configs in error messages by double quotes. Added the `toSQLConf()` method to `QueryErrorsBase` to invoke it from `Query.*Errors`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To highlight types and make them more visible for users.\r\n2. To be able to easily parse types from error text.\r\n3. To be consistent to other outputs of identifiers, sql statement and etc. where Spark uses quotes or ticks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it changes user-facing error messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr Introduce 4 new functions to KVUtils as follows:\r\n\r\n- `count`：Counts the number of elements in the KVStoreView which satisfy a predicate.\r\n- `foreach`：Applies a function f to all values produced by KVStoreView.\r\n- `mapToSeq`：Maps all values of KVStoreView to new Seq using a transformation function.\r\n- `size`: The size of KVStoreView.\r\n\r\nand use the these functions to simplify the code related to `KVStoreView`, the above functions will release `LevelDB/RocksDBIterator` earlier also.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSimplify code related to `KVStoreView` and release `LevelDB/RocksDBIterator` earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36324\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to modify the method `QueryErrorsBase.toSQLType()` to use double quotes for types in error messages.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To highlight types and make them more visible for users.\r\n2. To be able to easily parse types from error text.\r\n3. To be consistent to other outputs of identifiers, sql statement and etc. where Spark uses quotes or ticks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the PR changes user-facing errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryParsingErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly *CastSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly *AnsiCastSuiteWithAnsiModeOn\"\r\n$

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe PR refactors `FileSourceScanExec` case class into a base trait `FileSourceScanLike` which is then subclassed by `FileSourceScanExec`. `FileSourceScanLike` contains basic functionality like metrics and file listing while the `FileSourceScanExec` contains execution specific code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently the code for `FileSourceScanExec` class, the physical node for the file scans is quite complex and lengthy making it slightly difficult to reason about.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCode refactor, existing tests should

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to modify the method `QueryErrorsBase.toSQLType()` to use double quotes for types in error messages.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To highlight types and make them more visible for users.\r\n2. To be able to easily parse types from error text.\r\n3. To be consistent to other outputs of identifiers, sql statement and etc. where Spark uses quotes or ticks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the PR changes user-facing errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryParsingErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup per comment in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34960, to improve the documentation for data source v2 aggregate push down of Parquet and ORC.\r\n\r\n* Unify SQL config docs between Parquet and ORC, and add the note that if statistics is missing from any file footer, exception would be thrown.\r\n* Also adding the same note for exception in Parquet and ORC methods to aggregate from statistics.\r\n\r\nThough in future Spark release, we may improve the behavior to fallback to aggregate from real data of file, in case any statistics are missing. We'd better to make a clear documentation for current behavior now.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nGive users & developers a better idea of when aggregate push down would throw exception.\r\nHave a better documentation for current behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the documentation change in SQL configs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nConvert bools to ints in basic statistical functions of GroupBy objects: `mean`, `std`, `sum`, `var`, `median`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- To reach parity with pandas.\r\n- To be consistent with behaviors of basic statistical functions of Series/Index.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nIn basic statistical functions of GroupBy objects: previously, bools were excluded; now, bools are converted to ints (following pandas).\r\n\r\nTake `GroupBy.sum` as an example:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> df = ps.DataFrame(\r\n...             {\r\n...                 \"A\": [1, 2, 1, 2],\r\n...                 \"B\": [3.1, 4.1, 4.1, 3.1],\r\n...                 \"C\":

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add new page named \"Supported pandas APIs\" for pandas-on-Spark documents.\r\n\r\nThis is cherry-pick from https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/f43c68cb38cb0556f2058be6d3a016083ef5152d to `branch-3.3`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo let users can more easily find out whether a specific pandas API and its parameters are supported or not from the single document page.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the \"Supported pandas APIs\" page is added to the user guide for pandas API on Spark documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually check the links in the documents & the existing doc build should be passed.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-21T23:36:08Z","updated_at":"2023-04-22T05:42:38Z","closed_at":"2022-04-22T03:13:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e0bc289ec78c6db36db6d7a242f412f0717e026","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36308/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36308/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36308/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fa154c71f852793d179ec24d5c57a3b168f7ba28","head":{"label":"itholic:SPARK-38581-3.3","ref":"SPARK-38581-3.3","sha":"fa154c71f852793d179ec24d5c57a3b168f7ba28","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445423122,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoyeEg","name":"spark","full_name":"itholic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/itholic/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe support nesting an optional map of \"sub error classes\" in error-classes.json.\r\nEach sub class has a distinct message and independent parameters.\r\n  \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nA select subset of error classes have a large variety of error messages which cannot be easily tokenized.\r\nBut we do not want to split them because the conditions are often temporary. An example is UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE.\r\nSupporting nested error classes allows us to keep the variety of messages without exploding the number of error classes. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, we will change the error message texts\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRun all affected error test suites.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-21T23:12:19Z","updated_at":"2022-04-27T01:30:39Z","closed_at":"2022-04-27T01:30:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3bcb25d569a3764d910dd991f353689d3e339c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36307/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36307/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36307/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f9afd9147fc51ff819aee35541b3131004af679a","head":{"label":"srielau:SPARK-38985-sub-error-classes","ref":"SPARK-38985-sub-error-classes","sha":"f9afd9147fc51ff819aee35541b3131004af679a","user":{"login":"srielau","id":3514644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTQ2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3514644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau","html_url":"https://github.com/srielau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":399207476,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTkyMDc0NzY=","name":"spark","full_name":"srielau/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srielau","id":3514644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTQ2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3514644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau","html_url":"https://github.com/srielau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srielau/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdds the corruption exception handling for merged shuffle chunk when spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt is set to true(default value is true)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPrior to Spark 3.0,  spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt is set to true by default,  and this configuration is one of the knob for early corruption detection. So the fallback can be triggered as expected.\r\n\r\nAfter Spark 3.0, even though spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt is still set to true by default, but the early corruption detect knob is controlled with a new configuration  spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt.useExtraMemory, and it set to false by default. Thus the default behavior, with only Magnet enabled after Spark 3.2.0(internal li-3.1.1), will disable the early corruption detection, thus no fallback will be triggered. And it will drop to throw an exception when start to read the corrupted blocks.\r\n\r\nWe need to handle the corrupted stream for merged blocks with/out fallback in different scenarios:\r\n\r\nIf user sets the spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt.useExtraMemory to true, this will trigger the fallback. But this block only puts a small portion of the shuffle block and evaluate whether it has been corrupted. There is still possibility that it will be corrupted in later parts of the shuffle blocks. Then it will be handled by the spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt.\r\nIf the spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt.useExtraMemory is set to false, but spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt is set to true, it shouldn't throw an exception saying ShuffleChunk is not a shuffle block, and it should trigger the retry if the shuffleblock is shufflechunk.\r\nIf spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt.useExtraMemory is set to false, and spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt is set to false, it should just throw an exception in the client side and fail the task.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest is WIP. UT to be added\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-21T17:54:08Z","updated_at":"2022-09-25T00:23:47Z","closed_at":"2022-09-25T00:23:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0f0c1b24ca2b6e374d3125ad8061e29ee389179e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36305/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36305/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36305/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/997ca9f17077d3c7026c7dd6cbb7288eb2b2fd2a","head":{"label":"linkedin:SPARK-38987","ref":"SPARK-38987","sha":"997ca9f17077d3c7026c7dd6cbb7288eb2b2fd2a","user":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":285879539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU4Nzk1Mzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"linkedin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin/spark","description":"Apache

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes schema pruning for queries with multiple correlated subqueries. Previously, Spark would throw an exception trying to determine root fields in `SchemaPruning$identifyRootFields`. That was happening because expressions in predicates that referenced attributes in subqueries were not ignored. That's why attributes from multiple subqueries could conflict with each other (e.g. incompatible types) even though they should be ignored.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the following query would throw a runtime exception.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT name FROM contacts c\r\nWHERE\r\n EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ids i WHERE i.value = c.id)\r\n AND\r\n EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM first_names n WHERE c.name.first = n.value)\r\n```\r\n```\r\n[info]   org.apache.spark.SparkException: Failed to merge fields 'value' and 'value'. Failed to merge incompatible data types int and string\r\n[info]   at org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryExecutionErrors$.failedMergingFieldsError(QueryExecutionErrors.scala:936)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed to avoid exceptions for some queries with multiple correlated subqueries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR comes with

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBefore setting `FsUrlStreamHandlerFactory`, initialize the `LogFactory` in `commons-logging` or `jcl-over-slf4j` module in advance.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince both `commons-logging` and `jcl-over-slf4j` exist in Spark's jars directory, use `java -cp jars/*` to start the driver, which cannot guarantee which jar the class `org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory` comes from.\r\n\r\nIf it comes from `jcl-over-slf4j`, no problem.\r\n\r\nBut the loaded class comes from `commons-logging`, so there will be a problem when loading the hdfs jar.\r\nBecause after setting the `FsUrlStreamHandlerFactory`, when loading the HDFS jar, it will use the `BlockReaderFactory` of HDFS to read.\r\n`BlockReaderFactory` needs to load `LogFactory`. When `LogFactory` is loaded for the first time, it will look for the `commons-logging.properties` file. \r\nAt this time, `BlockReaderFactory` will be called again. Because the log object is not initialized properly, there is an NPE exception, and finally loading HDFS jar fails.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/commons-logging/blob/e511c56844d5fb1ba4b71c48fdfc75c1b6892ab2/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/logging/LogFactory.java#L453\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError\r\n\tat

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to disable `lineSep` option in `from_csv` and `schema_of_csv` expression by setting Noncharacters according to [unicode specification](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFFF0.pdf), `\\UFFFF`. This can be used for the internal purpose in a program according to the specification.\r\n\r\nThe Univocity parser does not allow to omit the line separator (from my code reading) so this approach was proposed.\r\n\r\nThis specific code path is not affected by our `encoding` or `charset` option because Unicovity parser parses them as unicodes as are internally.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, this option is weirdly effective. See the example of `from_csv` as below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\n\r\nSeq[String](\"1,\\n2,3,4,5\").toDF.select(\r\n  col(\"value\"),\r\n  from_csv(\r\n    col(\"value\"),\r\n    StructType(Seq(StructField(\"a\", LongType), StructField(\"b\", StringType)\r\n  )), Map[String,String]())).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-----------+---------------+\r\n|      value|from_csv(value)|\r\n+-----------+---------------+\r\n|1,\\n2,3,4,5|      {1, null}|\r\n+-----------+---------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n`{1, null}` has to be `{1, \\n2}`.\r\n\r\nThe CSV expressions cannot easily make it supported because this option is plan-wise option that can change the number of returned rows; however, the expressions are designed to emit one row only whereas this option is easily effective in the scan plan with CSV data source. Therefore, we should disable this option.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, now the `lineSep` can be located in the output from `from_csv` and `schema_of_csv`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, and unit test was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change fixes the scenarios where a stage re-attempt doesn't complete successfully, even though all the tasks complete when push-based shuffle is enabled.  With Adaptive Merge Finalization, a stage may be triggered for finalization when it is the below state:\r\n- The stage is not running (not in the running set of the DAGScheduler) - had failed or canceled or waiting, and\r\n- The stage has no pending partitions (all the tasks completed at-least once)\r\n\r\nFor such a stage when the finalization completes, the stage will still not be marked as mergeFinalized. \r\nThe stage of the stage will be: \r\n- `stage.shuffleDependency.mergeFinalized = false`\r\n- `stage.shuffleDependency.getFinalizeTask != Nil`\r\n- Merged statuses of the state are unregistered\r\n \r\nWhen the stage is resubmitted, the newer attempt of the stage will never complete even though its tasks may be completed. This is because the newer attempt of the stage will have `shuffleMergeEnabled = true`, since with the previous attempt the stage was never marked as mergedFinalized, and the finalizeTask is present (from finalization attempt for previous stage attempt).\r\n\r\n So, when all the tasks of the newer attempt complete, then these conditions will be true:\r\n- stage will be running\r\n- There will be no pending partitions since all the tasks completed\r\n- `stage.shuffleDependency.shuffleMergeEnabled = true`\r\n- `stage.shuffleDependency.shuffleMergeFinalized = false`\r\n- `stage.shuffleDependency.getFinalizeTask` is `not empty`\r\nThis leads the DAGScheduler to try scheduling finalization and not trigger the completion of the Stage. However because of the last condition it never even schedules the finalization and the stage never completes.\r\n\r\nIn addition, for determinate stages, which have completed merge finalization, we don't need to unregister merge results - since the stage retry, or any other stage computing the same shuffle id, can use it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe change fixes the above issue where the application gets stalled as some stages don't complete successfully.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI have just modified the existing UT. A stage will be marked finalized irrespective of its state and for deterministic stage we don't want to unregister merge

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to use backticks to wrap SQL identifiers in error messages. I added new util functions `toSQLId()` to the trait `QueryErrorsBase`, and applied it in `Query.*Errors` (also modified tests in `Query.*ErrorsSuite`). For example:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nInvalid SQL syntax: The definition of window win is repetitive.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\nInvalid SQL syntax: The definition of window `win` is repetitive.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL. The changes highlight SQL identifiers in error massages and make them more visible for users. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo since error classes haven't been released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryParsingErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsDSv2Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly

Also I introduced new base trait `QueryErrorsSuiteBase` for test suites w/ two helper methods:\r\n```scala\r\n  def checkErrorClass(\r\n      exception: Exception with SparkThrowable,\r\n      errorClass: String,\r\n      msg: String,\r\n      sqlState: Option[String] = None,\r\n      matchMsg: Boolean = false): Unit\r\n\r\n  def validateParsingError(\r\n      sqlText: String,\r\n      errorClass: String,\r\n      sqlState: String,\r\n      message: String): Unit\r\n```\r\nThe methods are supposed to be used in `QueryParsingErrorsSuite`, `QueryCompilationErrorsSuite`, `QueryExecutionErrorsSuite` and so on, to check error classes, messages, and sqlStates.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe error class tags will be used as unique identifiers to google issues, and refer to Spark docs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the PR changes user-facing error messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsDSv2Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly *QueryParsingErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-04-20T19:50:02Z","updated_at":"2022-04-22T05:09:06Z","closed_at":"2022-04-22T05:09:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0defb4d946f6b661ba3a533113c5645078634d2e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36287/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36287/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36287/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/82a8c48a2e97a698a73ca0324a5c55431162b951","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:output-error-class-tag","ref":"output-error-class-tag","sha":"82a8c48a2e97a698a73ca0324a5c55431162b951","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `configure-jobs` and `precondition` jobs in the `build-and-test` workflow should be skipped on fork repositories as all subsequent / dependent jobs are already skipped.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe `build and test` workflow is scheduled to run six times a day. The jobs then only run for `type == 'scheduled'` inside apache/spark repository, not for forks. However, the `configure-jobs` and `precondition` jobs always run, even though all subsequent jobs are skipped on forks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, most the ANSI error message shows the hint \"If necessary set spark.sql.ansi.enabled to false to bypass this error.\" \r\n\r\nThere is only one special case: \"Map key not exist\" or \"array index out of bound\" from the `[]` operator. It shows the config spark.sql.ansi.strictIndexOperator instead.\r\n\r\nThis one special case can confuse users. To make it simple:\r\n- Turn \"spark.sql.ansi.strictIndexOperator\" into an internal configuration\r\n- Show the configuration `spark.sql.ansi.enabled` in error messages instead\r\n- If it is \"map key not exist\" error, show the hint for using `try_element_at`. Otherwise, we don't show it. For array, `[]` operator is using 0-based index while `try_element_at` is using 1-based index.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMake the hints in ANSI runtime error message simple and consistent\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the new configuration is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n* Optimize `RemoteBlockPushResolver`\r\n  * Pushed blocks are cached  in a memory pool before flushing to the final data file. So we can control the memory used by `RemoteBlockPushResolver`.\r\n  * Attempts to acquire lock only when merging pushed block data into the final data file. This is very useful when a reduce has many small pushed blocks at the same time. \r\n  * Remove `BLOCK_APPEND_COLLISION_DETECTED` failure because only one pushed map data can write the data file at the same time.\r\n* Change `BlockPushNonFatalFailure`  to `BlockPushResponse`, so the returnCode can be `SUCCESS`. We can also encode and decode it to a ByteBuffer, so network RPC do not need to rely on `BlockTransferMessage` (core module). And remove `PUSH_BLOCK_RETURN_CODE` type from `BlockTransferMessage`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor push-based shuffle service, there are many `BLOCK_APPEND_COLLISION_DETECTED` when there are many small map tasks outputs. In `RemoteBlockPushResolver`, if one map task pushed blocks is writing, the others map tasks pushed blocks will failed in `onComplete()` method.\r\nAnd `RemoteBlockPushResolver` has no memory limit , so many executors will OOM when there are many small pushed blocks waiting to be written to the final data file.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExists UTs\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-20T08:37:59Z","updated_at":"2022-09-24T00:27:35Z","closed_at":"2022-09-24T00:27:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ef3e09967f825be7ec7da5efc7dc8312375ba998","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36279/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36279/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36279/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7f362911f2bdcb8280d3658310d627509e980d2d","head":{"label":"wankunde:retry_transfer_block","ref":"retry_transfer_block","sha":"7f362911f2bdcb8280d3658310d627509e980d2d","user":{"login":"wankunde","id":3626747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjY3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3626747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde","html_url":"https://github.com/wankunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260172941,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAxNzI5NDE=","name":"spark","full_name":"wankunde/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wankunde","id":3626747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjY3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3626747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde","html_url":"https://github.com/wankunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wankunde/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImprove the error messages for cast failures in ANSI.\r\nAs mentioned in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38929, this PR targets two cast-to types: numeric types and date types.\r\n* For numeric(`int`, `smallint`, `double`, `float`, `decimal` ..) types, it embeds the cast-to types in the error message. For example,\r\n  ```\r\n  Invalid input value for type INT: '1.0'. To return NULL instead, use 'try_cast'. If necessary set %s to false to bypass this error.\r\n  ```\r\n  It uses the `toSQLType` and `toSQLValue` to wrap the corresponding types and literals.\r\n* For date types, it does similarly as above. For example,\r\n  ```\r\n  Invalid input value for type TIMESTAMP: 'a'. To return NULL instead, use 'try_cast'. If necessary set spark.sql.ansi.enabled to false to bypass this error.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve the error message in general.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR uses multipart identifiers when parsing table-valued functions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make table-valued functions error messages consistent for 2-part names and n-part names. For example, before this PR:\r\n```\r\nselect * from a.b.c\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:\r\nInvalid SQL syntax: Unsupported function name `a`.`b`.`c`(line 1, pos 14)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nselect * from a.b.c(1)\r\n--------------^^^\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n```\r\nInvalid SQL syntax: table valued function cannot specify database name (line 1, pos 14)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nSELECT * FROM a.b.c(1)\r\n--------------^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nDatasource v2 can be used to connect to some databases who support [unique key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_key).\r\n\r\nSpark catalyst optimizer support do further optimization through distinct keys. So it can improve the performance if the Scan reports its distinct keys to Spark.\r\n\r\nWe already have several optimizer rules for distinct keys, for example:\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35779\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36117\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36530\r\n\r\nWe also have some prs which is in progress related distinct keys,  for example:\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37267\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36180\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, a new interface added for developer\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces the following:\r\n- Parser changes to have an `IF EXISTS` clause for `DROP COLUMN`.\r\n- Logic to silence the errors within parser and analyzer when encountering missing columns while using `IF EXISTS`\r\n- Ensure only resolving and dropping existing columns inside table schema\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently `ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN(s) ...` syntax will always throw error if the column doesn't exist. This PR would like to provide an (IF EXISTS) syntax to provide better user experience for downstream handlers (such as Delta with incoming column dropping support) that support it, and make consistent with some other DMLs such as `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser may now specify `ALTER TABLE xxx DROP COLUMN(S) IF EXISTS a, a.b, c.d`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModified existing unit tests and new unit tests.\r\n\r\n@cloud-fan @gengliangwang @MaxGekk

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces the following:\r\n- Parser changes to have an `IF EXISTS` syntax for `DROP COLUMN`.\r\n- Logic to silence the errors within parser and analyzer when encountering missing columns while using `IF EXISTS`\r\n- Ensure only resolving and dropping existing columns inside table schema\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently `ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN(s) ...` syntax will always throw error if the column doesn't exist. This PR would like to provide an (IF EXISTS) syntax to provide better user experience for downstream handlers (such as Delta with incoming column dropping support) that support it, and make consistent with some other DMLs such as `DROP TABLE (IF EXISTS)`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser may now specify `ALTER TABLE xxx DROP IF EXISTS COLUMN(S) a, a.b,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces the following:\r\n- Parser changes to have an `IF EXISTS` syntax for `DROP COLUMN`.\r\n- Logic to silence the errors within parser and analyzer when encountering missing columns while using `IF EXISTS`\r\n- Ensure only resolving and dropping existing columns inside table schema\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently `ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN(s) ...` syntax will always throw error if the column doesn't exist. This PR would like to provide an (IF EXISTS) syntax to provide better user experience for downstream handlers (such as Delta with incoming column dropping support) that support it, and make consistent with some other DMLs such as `DROP TABLE (IF EXISTS)`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser may now specify `ALTER TABLE xxx DROP IF EXISTS COLUMN(S) a, a.b, c.d`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModified existing unit tests and new unit
