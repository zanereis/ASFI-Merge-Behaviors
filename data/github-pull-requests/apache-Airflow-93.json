#23967 \r\n\r\nOriginal code use `log_directory` defined in `airflow.cfg` even though another `base_log_folder` is defined in logging config. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds logic to attempt to override `log_directory` if `logging_config_class` and `base_log_folder` are both defined, and fall back to original default log directory if they don't\r\n\r\nHow to test if it works: \r\n\r\n1. execute `breeze start-airflow --executor CeleryExecutor --backend postgres --load-example-dags --db-reset`\r\n2. go to `$AIRFLOW_HOME`, create a directory called `config`, and create an empty `__init__.py` and `log_config.py` file inside\r\n3. Inside `airflow/config_templates/airflow_local_settings.py`, modify `DEFAULT_LOGGING_CONFIG[handlers][task][base_log_folder]` to some other different locations\r\n4. copy all the contents inside `airflow/config_templates/airflow_local_settings.py` into `log_config.py`\r\n5. In `/root/airflow/airflow.cfg` , under `logging` section,  modify `logging_config_class` to `log_config.DEFAULT_LOGGING_CONFIG`\r\n6. Restart everything\r\n7. Run a DAG in webUI, check the log, and you should be about to see the logs are served. \r\n8. Go to the location that you defined in step 3, and you should see the dag log\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-23T08:49:16Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T17:40:23Z","closed_at":"2023-07-26T17:46:45Z","merged_at":"2023-07-26T17:46:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"579ce065c5b0865b4aea580ee2d05c89680b7a8b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Adaverse","id":35839624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODM5NjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35839624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adaverse","html_url":"https://github.com/Adaverse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adaverse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adaverse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adaverse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adaverse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adaverse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adaverse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adaverse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adaverse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adaverse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

test has been recently failing with deadlock (see #32778) and needs thorough looking at if we want to find the root cause/remedium.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it looks like a niche case connected with Dask Executor that is rather obsure and we have no expertise in solving problems with and diagnosing, so until the problem is diagnosed it might be a long time (and maybe even we decide not to care about it and let Dask community take a look and either fix or ignore it.\r\n\r\nWe aim to have a very low number of those Quarantined tests (currently we have 1 and we have not run it for a while as this was a mysql test run on Postgres) but we have now the opportunity to also improve the quarantined tests framework.\r\n\r\nThis test will be run together with other (1) quarantined test and:\r\n\r\n* they will not be run in our regular tests\r\n* they are run sequentially not in parallel with all other tests\r\n* they are run for all 4 backends but only for the default versions of those backends\r\n* failure of the quarantined tests will not cause failure of the whole job or limit constraints from being generated and updated\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software

In some\r\ncases some providers and DAGs could rely on some default values being\r\navailable as default, but when we move them from core, and use older\r\nversion of provider those defaults were not available:\r\n\r\n* they were remove as defaults in core\r\n* the old providers did not have \"config\" section to contribute the\r\n  defaults\r\n\r\nThis would be a breaking change and old providers (Celery, K8s) could\r\nfail - as it happened in some tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a nice solution to that, also allowing to remove\r\nsome manual fallbacks in Celery and Kubernetes executor code.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to add a hard-coded \"pre-2.7\" configuration which\r\nwould only contain \"provider\" pre-2.7 hard-coded defaults and make\r\nit a fallback option if the values are neither set nor defaults\r\ncontributed by the providers.\r\n\r\nWe do not have to maintain those - the defaults are \"frozen\"\r\neffectively at the values available just before 2.7. The nice side\r\neffect is that we can remove a number of fallbacks, because this\r\nhard-coded configuration becomes the fallback automatically,\r\n\r\nThat entirely solves the case where you want to install older\r\nproviders on 2.7 where config.yml does not contain those provider\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is the base class for logging handlers, including those that don't log to files via delegating to logging.FileHandler, e.g. in the CloudwatchTaskHandler at https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/2940b9fa55a6a72c60c2162e541631addec3d6b8/airflow/providers/amazon/aws/log/cloudwatch_task_handler.py#L67\r\n\r\nIt is suspected that type checking is not enabled in this part of the CloudwatchTaskHandler otherwise it would have already been failing.\r\n\r\nThis change adjusts the base class so if type checking is enabled in the task handler, if it delegates to a logging.Handler that is not a logging.FileHandler as the CloudWatchHandler, then the type checking should pass.\r\n\r\nThis was originally part of https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/31855 and

is the big move of all Kubenetes classes to go to provider.\r\n\r\nThe changes that are implemented in this move:\r\n\r\n* replaced all imports from airflow.kubernetes to cncf.kubernetes\r\n  Swith PEP-563 dynamic import rediretion and deprecation messages\r\n  those messages now support overriding the \"replacement\" hints\r\n  to make K8s deprecations more accurate\r\n* pre_7_4_0_compatibility package with classes used by past\r\n  providerrs have been \"frozen\" and stored in the package with\r\n  import redirections from airflow.kubernetes(with deprecation warnings)\r\n* kubernetes configuration is moved to kubernetes provider\r\n* mypy started complaining about conf and set used in configuration.\r\n  so better solution to handle deprecations and hinting conf\r\n  returning AirlfowConfigParsing was added.\r\n* example_kuberntes_executor uses configuration reading not in\r\n  top level but in execute method\r\n* PodMutationHookException and PodReconciliationError have\r\n  been moved to cncf.kubernetes provider and they are imported\r\n  from there with fallback to an airflow.exception ones in case\r\n  old provider is used in Airflow 2.7.0\r\n* k8s methods in task_instance have been deprecated and reolaced\r\n  with functions in \"cncf.kubernetes` template_rendering module\r\n  the old way still works but raise deprecaton warnings.\r\n* added extras with versions for celery and k8s\r\n* raise AirflowOptionalProviderFeatureException in case there is\r\n  attempt to use CeleryK8sExecutor and cncf.k8s is not installed.\r\n* added few \"new\" core utils to k8s (hashlib_wrapper etc)\r\n* both warnings and errors indicate minimum versions for both cncf.k8s\r\n  and Celery providers.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under

number of commands in Airflow relies on the fact that\r\nproviders configuration is loaded. This is a rather fast operation\r\nas it does not involve any importing of provider classes, just\r\ndiscovering entrypoints, running them and parsing yaml configuration,\r\nso it is a very low sub-second time to do it.\r\n\r\nWe cannot do it once in settings/config because we actually need\r\nsettings/config to be pre-initialized without providers in order\r\nto be able to bootstrap airflow, therefore we need to run\r\nit individually in each command that can be run with the\r\n\"airflow\" entrypoint. Decorator seems to be best suited to do\r\nthe job:\r\n\r\n* easy to apply and not easy to forget when you create another\r\n  command and look at other commands\r\n* nicely wraps around local ProvidersManager import\r\n\r\nThere are exceptions for the \"version\" and \"providers lazy-loaded\"\r\ncommands because they are NOT supposed to initialize configuration\r\nof providers.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Celery Executor tests in Helm started to fail after the configuration migration has been merged (#32604). The PR did not have \"full tests needed\" label and it skipped K8S tests because there was no change related to kubernetes (but some fundamental changes in how configuration were retrieved caused the Celery Executor failed on missing default configuration value.\r\n\r\nThe change adds ProvidersManager configuration initialization when executors are started in order to fix the problem temporarily, however there is an ongoing effort to optimise the path of retrieving provider configuration without having to initialize all provider's configuration and those lines will be removed when it happens.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

an issue with installing pymssql on ARM architecture triggered by Cython 3.0.0 release as of 18 July 2023. The problem is that pip uses latest Cython to compile pymssql and since we are using setuptools, there is no easy way to fix version of Cython used to compile packages.\r\n\r\nThis triggers a problem with newer `pip` versions that have build isolation enabled by default because There is no (easy) way to pin build dependencies for dependent packages. If a package does not have  limit on build dependencies, it will use the latest version of them to build that particular package.\r\n\r\nThe workaround to the problem suggest in the last thread by Pradyun Gedam - pip maintainer - is to use PIP_CONSTRAINT environment variable and constraint the version of Cython used while installing the package. Which is precisely what we are doing here.\r\n\r\nNote that it does not work if we pass ``--constraint`` option to pip because it will not be passed to the package being build in isolation. The fact that the PIP_CONSTRAINT env variable works in the isolation is a bit of side-effect on how env variables work and that they are passed to subprocesses as pip launches a subprocess `pip` to build the package.\r\n\r\nThis is a temporary solution until the issue is resolved in pymssql or Cython.\r\n\r\nIssues/discussions that track it:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5541\r\n* https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/827\r\n* https://discuss.python.org/t/no-way-to-pin-build-dependencies/29833\r\n\r\nSince we have to change Dockerfile around installing `pip`, also version of `pip` has been upgraded to latest - 23.2\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

the `get_contributor_stats` script in dev/stats, the endpoint used to get PRs from the GitHub API, which does not accept dates or date ranges, causes the script to error out with a rate-limit exception before it can finish executing. \r\n\r\nWith this change, the script will get PRs from the API by first getting commits, which allows for date specification. Together with other changes, this will significantly decrease the number of calls required and allow the script to run to completion. \r\n\r\nAll-told, the changes here reduce the number of requests by around 50%, cutting well over 1000 requests when executing the script for this month.\r\n\r\nAlso included: \r\n- a number of changes to consolidate functions and thereby reduce the number of API calls further.\r\n- an optional API rate limit parameter and output with requests remaining and the reset time in the system tz.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the

Description\r\n\r\nThe new Trigger Form UI released in 2.6 is handy but doesn't support `array` params of data types other than string. For more flexibility, this PR proposes to generate a JSON field similar to the `object` param if the users specify the attribute `items` in `schema`.\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nUse an `array` param and require the items to be integers.\r\n\r\n```\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=Path(__file__).stem,\r\n    description=__doc__[0 : __doc__.find(\".\")],\r\n    doc_md=__doc__,\r\n    schedule=None,\r\n    start_date=datetime.datetime(2022, 3, 4),\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n    tags=[\"example_ui\"],\r\n    params={\r\n        \"array_of_numbers\": Param(\r\n            [1, 2, 3],\r\n            \"Only integers are accepted in this array\",\r\n            type=\"array\",\r\n            title=\"Array of numbers\",\r\n            items={\"type\": \"number\"},\r\n        ),\r\n    },\r\n) as dag:\r\n\r\n    @task(task_id=\"show_params\")\r\n    def show_params(**kwargs) -> None:\r\n        ti: TaskInstance = kwargs[\"ti\"]\r\n        dag_run: DagRun = ti.dag_run\r\n        if not dag_run.conf:\r\n            print(\"Uups, no parameters supplied as DagRun.conf, was the trigger w/o form?\")\r\n            raise AirflowSkipException(\"No DagRun.conf parameters supplied.\")\r\n        print(f\"This DAG was triggered with the following parameters:\\n{json.dumps(dag_run.conf, indent=4)}\")\r\n\r\n    show_params()\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThe Generated Conf JSON shows an array of strings\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1132\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/9677913/36191337-3676-4f61-aed5-24b278bffe95\">\r\n\r\nAnd we cannot trigger the DAG:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1162\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/9677913/d8369464-8d77-4ce6-9c5b-9492e19a14c8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nWe can manually update the Generated Configuration JSON box, but it is not user friendly (especially if we expect an array of objects!), and will become counter intuitive as users get used to the benefits of the new trigger form.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @jens-scheffler-bosch ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-21T02:25:59Z","updated_at":"2023-08-03T12:19:17Z","closed_at":"2023-08-03T09:02:35Z","merged_at":"2023-08-03T09:02:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"da6931561f59a64f6489c56a5675c2cc6e6a2bca","assignee":{"login":"jscheffl","id":95105677,"node_id":"U_kgDOBasyjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95105677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl","html_url":"https://github.com/jscheffl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jscheffl","id":95105677,"node_id":"U_kgDOBasyjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95105677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl","html_url":"https://github.com/jscheffl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent

PR adds existing secret support for PGBouncer's metrics exporter sidecar container. While PGBouncer's container supports existing secrets for its configuration through `configSecretName`, the metrics exporter sidecar lacked this feature which prevented users from effectively configuring the PGBouncer deployment with existing secrets.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds the possibility to define a custom secrets key in the existing stats secret. This allows users to use an existing secret without risking conflicts from the generic key `connection` if used in other deployments. If left undefined, the secrets key will default to `connection` as expected.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

`on_task_instance_running` was being called in `_run_raw_task`. After this, it will be running close to where `pre_execute` callback is called.\r\n\r\nThis had disadvantage of being run before operator templates are rendered. \r\nIn some usages, this required users of this interface (like OpenLineage) to resolve templates themselves, which comes with obvious performance drawback. Now, the state of actual executed task is the same as on `execute`. \r\n\r\nAnother reason of moving call site is that idea of task instance listener API is to provide notification as close to when actual execution happens. This is as close as we can get AFAIK.","created_at":"2023-07-20T12:26:25Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T16:08:25Z","closed_at":"2023-07-25T09:16:47Z","merged_at":"2023-07-25T09:16:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"ca202512afa2e90a406ae64b4a2650c8272290c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eladkal","id":45845474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODQ1NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45845474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal","html_url":"https://github.com/eladkal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172800850,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwODUw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:improvement","name":"type:improvement","color":"5AF3AB","defaul

PR solves a couple of bugs in `test_example_dags.py`.\r\n\r\nBy going up to `parents[3]` we were going outside the repository root, luckily (or unluckily) the repo folder is also named `airflow` so the pattern `airflow/**/example_dags/example_*.py` still worked, but `tests/system/providers/**/example_*.py` wasn't used.\r\n\r\nbefore: collected 105 items\r\nafter: collected 695 items \r\n\r\nThis discovered 2 new errors:\r\n\r\n- `example_local_to_wasb.py` was trivial to fix\r\n\r\n- `example_redis_publish.py`: this one fails because `RedisPubSubSensor` constructor calls `Redis.pubsub().subscribe()`, which just hangs and DagBag fails with timeout. For now I'm just deleting this operator from the example.","created_at":"2023-07-20T10:49:44Z","updated_at":"2023-08-27T16:27:31Z","closed_at":"2023-08-04T16:24:16Z","merged_at":"2023-08-04T16:24:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"c048bd5d9e98b05a8c2b68af0ef1853a700888f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471850767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUwNzY3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:microsoft-azure","name":"provider:microsoft-azure","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Azure-related

With this change we would introduce a new flag on `Pool`, that allows an admin to decide whether to include tasks in deferred state in the pool open slot calculation or not. By default we would not consider them, which mirrors the current behavior.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned by various people on the discussion, having this as an option can be quite useful, especially in cases where the system that is \"shielded\" by the pool is not completely in the control of the developer. This allows us to (mis)use pools as a rate-limiting device even when using the new deferrable operators.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-20T07:22:13Z","updated_at":"2023-08-09T12:34:41Z","closed_at":"2023-08-09T12:34:37Z","merged_at":"2023-08-09T12:34:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"70a050b1c3a46e3eabae7f6052c95718800dc604","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.co

might get accidentally initialized during CLI argument parsing, and if it does, then CLI and arg completion takes huge performance hit - it takes seconds to intialize ProvidersManager when you have many providers packages installed, so initializing ProvidersManager should not happen just when you parse arguments of the CLIs but only when you execute commands.\r\n\r\nIt's rather easy to trigger ProvidersManager by just importing some package (especially as we move executors to providers).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new CLI command in providers to check status of initialization - this command will fail when provider's initlalization is executed during CLI parsing. It will also show the stack trace of where ProvidersManager has been initialized from.\r\n\r\nTest is added to detect such situation by running the new command in a separate subprocess, thus making sure ProvidersManager has not been initialized in another test.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

some cases - like when provider is included by `breeze prod-image build --install-providers-from-sources` plugins are not loaded, as they are not separate package with entrypoint then. This PR adds loading plugins from `provider.yml`. I think this is somehow similar to what @potiuk is doing with stuff like config or executors.\r\n\r\nIn some cases this would make entrypoint plugins double-load - so we check if the plugin is already loaded. We could avoid that by not generating entrypoints for plugins, but this would make them not load on earlier versions of Airflow.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-19T10:54:41Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T16:08:57Z","closed_at":"2023-07-25T09:17:38Z","merged_at":"2023-07-25T09:17:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"a23bf4c06a12b4c91f6f0501a8a624c612fd4455","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"Taragolis","id":3998685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTg2ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3998685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis","html_url":"https://github.com/Taragolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pankajastro","id":98807258,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeOt2g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98807258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro","html_url":"https://github.com/pankajastro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1780460538,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzgwNDYwNTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:plugins","name":"area:plugins","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172800071,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwMDcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:new-feature","name":"type:new-feature","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

would like to use the config.yml approach as our main source of truth\r\nfor airflow configuration. So far it has been split amongst multiple\r\nfiles:\r\n\r\n  * confg.yml -> descroption\r\n  * default_airflow.cfg -> JINJA template to keep cofiguration, examples\r\n    and description (used to generate airflow.cfg when airflow starts)\r\n  * default_test.cfg -> storing test-only configuration used in some\r\n    test cases - used to generate unittest.cfg\r\n  * scripts/in_container/airflow_ci.cfg where dCI-specific configuration\r\n    overwrote the unittest.cfg\r\n\r\nThis change consolidates it all into unified appraoch, where all\r\nconfiguration information is retrieved from .yml files stored in\r\nconfig_templates. No more additional template files processed by\r\nJINJA, no more special CI versions of it, no more unittestdb.cfg file\r\nwhere such configuration would be generated, no more unittestdb to\r\nbe used separately for tests.\r\n\r\n* The default_*.cfg files were not real configuration files, becuase\r\n  they were really JINJA templates and it got peoeple confused when\r\n  copying the files. This change leaves the file empty with the\r\n  comment that instructs the user how they can get the default\r\n  configuration.\r\n* The default_airflow.cfg is gone and instead, we have a way to\r\n  show defaults via `airflow config list --defaults` command\r\n* Unittest config is generated on-the-flight using defaults stored\r\n  in confg_templates. constituing a single place where they need\r\n  to be changed for the tests to use them\r\n* internally, description of the configuration is stored in\r\n  AirflowConfigurationParser and used by the parser to generate\r\n  the default configuration when needed.\r\n* we got rid of `{{{{` in templated config defaults by marking\r\n  the templates with ``is_template`` and getting rid of processing\r\n  those entries with regular formatting when generating the default\r\n  values. This only concerns defaults from config.yml. Reading\r\n  those configuration entries from file is unaffected.\r\n\r\nThis change aims to be 100% backwards compatible with the previous\r\nimplementation when it comes to functionality, even if internals\r\nchanged. It also does not add provider-specific changes that are\r\ncoming separately.\r\n\r\nThe only changes visible to the user are:\r\n\r\n* generated airflow.cfg is slightly more\r\n  readable and displays names of variables that can be used to override\r\n  each configuration (which is very useful for copy&pasting)\r\n\r\n* user are advised, instead of copying the default_airflow.cfg to use\r\n  `airflow config list --defaults` to generate production config. This\r\n  configuration has all the entries commented out, so that they can\r\n  selectively uncomment and change the values they want. This is now\r\n  promoted as \"best practice\" in the documentation.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

up to #31043, this adds Pod Security Context to Pgbouncer which was previously hard coded. \r\n\r\nFollow up to #31865, this switches to `externalContainerSecurityContext` for both pgbouncer containers. I believe Pgbouncer (like statsd and redis) should not propagate the global security context because it isn't an Airflow pod. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR adds a feature by adding the `TaskContextLogger` class that \r\ncan forward messages from Airflow components like Scheduler, \r\nExecutor, etc to the task logs. This is helpful when in exception \r\nscenarios the task is marked as failed from these components \r\ne.g. when task times out because it remains stuck in the queue or \r\nwhen a zombie task is killed. In such scenarios, currently, no task \r\nlogs are available in the UI and the user does not have a clue why \r\nthe task failed. Forwarding such event messages to the task logs \r\nwill give a clear idea to the user.\r\n\r\nThe PR also adds a config param to disable this feature in case\r\nsomething is observed to be not working well in the Airflow \r\ncomponents due to the addition of this feature.\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
