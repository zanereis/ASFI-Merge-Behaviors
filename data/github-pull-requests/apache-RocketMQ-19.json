checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-31T03:25:59Z","updated_at":"2022-09-01T02:11:46Z","closed_at":"2022-09-01T02:11:46Z","merged_at":"2022-09-01T02:11:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"cafb31961271785a26603a0726fc62393805cd96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/15","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/15","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/15/labels","id":5205650,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTIwNTY1MA==","number":15,"title":"5.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"duhenglucky","id":7938968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Mzg5Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7938968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky","html_url":"https://github.com/duhenglucky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":117,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-16T12:11:57Z","updated_at":"2023-09-01T00:07:42Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2022-10-08T01:59:29Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4940/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4940/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4940/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/fd3c7a9f035ebe02ac529d9a323f75393ddb85d4","head":{"label":"xdkxlk:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"fd3c7a9f035ebe02ac529d9a323f75393ddb85d4","user":{"login":"xdkxlk","id":10397306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk3MzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10397306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk","html_url":"https://github.com/xdkxlk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":515875387,"node_id":"R_kgDOHr-iOw","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"xdkxlk/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xdkxlk","id":10397306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk3MzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10397306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk","html_url":"https://github.com/xdkxlk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xdkxlk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xdkxlk/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nfix excessive nesting \r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

Fix indentation of code within Configuration.java\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

At present, it takes some 40 minutes for travis CI or github action to build and run tests. This is a blocking issue for work efficiency. \r\n\r\nThis is to follow [practice and philosophy of Google Build ](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch18.html). The first \r\nis to bring distributed remote build and execution(RBE hereafter) through Bazel.\r\n\r\nThrough the introduction of RBE, we are expecting to see a major CI running time reduction, from some 40 minutes to 2 or 3 minutes. \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nThis PR looks big at the first sight. But it actually contains two major changes\r\n1. Bazel Build System files, including .bzl, .bazel, and WORKSPACE that make Bazel work;\r\n2. Fixes to existing test cases and some main source files, allowing execution of test cases in parallel;\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-24T04:00:57Z","updated_at":"2022-08-24T12:53:30Z","closed_at":"2022-08-24T12:53:30Z","merged_at":"2022-08-24T12:53:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"3da7ea9c1bcee83ec7eb84b58eae718f121bbdaa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"lwclover","id":4252409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTI0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4252409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover","html_url":"https://github.com/lwclover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"YangJodie","id":5009624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDk2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5009624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangJodie","html_url":"https://github.com/YangJodie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangJodie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangJodie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangJodie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangJodie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangJodie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangJodie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangJodie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangJodie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangJodie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vintagewang","id":1527648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mjc2NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1527648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vintagewang","html_url":"https://github.com/vintagewang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vintagewang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vintagewang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vintagewang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vintagewang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vintagewang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vintagewang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vintagewang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vintagewang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vintagewang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4878/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4878/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4878/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/b37791ef59ae28d9d17936fca079ae741aea1655","head":{"label":"lizhanhui:bazel_pr","ref":"bazel_pr","sha":"b37791ef59ae28d9d17936fca079ae741aea1655","user":{"login":"lizhanhui","id":641819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTgxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui","html_url":"https://github.com/lizhanhui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79726827,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3OTcyNjgyNw==","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"lizhanhui/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lizhanhui","id":641819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTgxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641819?v

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-24T03:14:50Z","updated_at":"2022-08-24T03:16:15Z","closed_at":"2022-08-24T03:15:02Z","merged_at":"2022-08-24T03:15:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"ece4fff3f656b3d529b6ca4563524af2cd22706e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4877/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4877/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4877/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/c0621a70803c4fe99f05921485802c37694e58a3","head":{"label":"lizhanhui:bazel","ref":"bazel","sha":"c0621a70803c4fe99f05921485802c37694e58a3","user":{"login":"lizhanhui","id":641819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTgxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui","html_url":"https://github.com/lizhanhui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79726827,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3OTcyNjgyNw==","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"lizhanhui/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lizhanhui","id":641819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTgxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui","html_url":"https://github.com/lizhanhui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lizhanhui/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-20T04:13:57Z","updated_at":"2022-08-20T18:57:48Z","closed_at":"2022-08-20T04:24:54Z","merged_at":"2022-08-20T04:24:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"97521a3d8d9ee3c3ea7f082fa74e3d412da0d0b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4850/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4850/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4850/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/b245d2cf166ad62e00baa269113e6f3f2a9ab984","head":{"label":"allenzhu:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"b245d2cf166ad62e00baa269113e6f3f2a9ab984","user":{"login":"allenzhu","id":1324247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjQyNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1324247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu","html_url":"https://github.com/allenzhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":520836078,"node_id":"R_kgDOHwtT7g","name":"apache_rocketmq","full_name":"allenzhu/apache_rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"allenzhu","id":1324247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjQyNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1324247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu","html_url":"https://github.com/allenzhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenzhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/allenzhu/apache_rocketmq","description":"Apache

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

dependencies of `Producer` and `Consumer` in `EscapeBridge`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

RIP-7 https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/wiki/RIP-7-Multiple-Directories-Storage-Support, CommitLog File has supported multi-directories storage mode.\r\nIn this case, the commitlog can be stored on multiple disks, but consumequeue/index is still stored on one disk. However, the size of consumequeue/index can reach tens of Gbs, or even 100 Gbs, and the space used can't be easily ignored.\r\nThe current commitLog multipath needs to be configured independently, as follows:\r\n```java\r\nstorePathRootDir=/rmqstore1\r\nstorePathCommitLog=/rmqstore1/commitlog:/rmqstore2/commitlog\r\n```\r\nTherefore, I optimized the multi-path mode, and the improvements are as follows:\r\n● Add multi-path mode for consumequeue.  \r\n● Add multi-path mode for indexfile.\r\n● Optimize the method to get the commitlog path. It is not necessary to specify storePathCommitLog separately, and generate the storePathCommitLog from storePathRootDir.\r\n● Add a Timed thread to check path capacity. When select store path, it will  try to avoid writing to a nearly full disk.\r\n● Loading  metadata in multi-path. By default, the config file is stored in the first path, and the config bak file is stored in the second path. For example: storePathRootDir = /rmqstore0:/rmqstore1:/rmqstore2, config dir = /rmqstore0/config, config bak dir = /rmqstore1/config. At startup, scan all paths and load the config file from the latest path of dataversion.（This ensures that when the path is changed, the latest version can be loaded）\r\n● Loading checkpoint file and abort file in multi-path. The loading path of the checkpoint file and the abort file is the same as that of the config file.\r\n\r\n## Chinese Version / 中文版本\r\n在RIP-7 https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/wiki/RIP-7-Multiple-Directories-Storage-Support 当中，CommitLog文件已经支持了多文件路径的存储模式。\r\n在这个情况下，commitLog可以被存储至多块磁盘当中，但是consumequeue和index依然存储于单盘上。然而consumequeue 和 index的文件大小也可能达到数十G或者上百G的大小。这样的存储空间并不能被忽略。\r\n当前的commitLog的多路径需要被额外配置，如下所示：\r\n```java\r\nstorePathRootDir=/rmqstore1\r\nstorePathCommitLog=/rmqstore1/commitlog:/rmqstore2/commitlog\r\n```\r\n因此，我对多路径模式做了一定的优化，改进主要如下：\r\n● consumequeue的存储增加多路径模式。\r\n● indexfile的存储增加多路径模式。\r\n● 优化commitlog获取文件路径的方式。不必要单独设置storePathCommitLog，storePathCommitLog可以从storePathRootDir根目录下直接生成。\r\n● 增加一个定时线程检查路径的容量。当选择写入路径的时候，尽量避免写入至快满的磁盘中。\r\n● 多路径下的元数据加载。默认将config文件夹写入至第1个路径中，config文件夹的bak文件写入至第2个路径。例如：storePathRootDir = /rmqstore0:/rmqstore1:/rmqstore2, config dir = /rmqstore0/config, config bak dir = /rmqstore1/config。在启动的时候，扫描所有路径，选择dataversion最新的所在路径作为初始加载路径。（这样能确保路径被更改时，能够从最新的路径下加载）\r\n● 加载checkpoint文件和abort文件。checkpoint文件和abort文件的加载路径与config路径保持一致。","created_at":"2022-08-15T08:34:51Z","updated_at":"2023-09-14T00:07:20Z","closed_at":"2023-09-14T00:07:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"27d568e9666af5111732cbf8f0d4c9c154e88f12","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zhouxinyu","id":3961183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjExODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3961183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu","html_url":"https://github.com/zhouxinyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4509456568,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBHrsl88AAAABDMjYuA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4825/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4825/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4825/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/89594cb2d26050bb16a44be6756beb48e27ff93d","head":{"label":"shengminw:multi-route","ref":"multi-route","sha":"89594cb2d26050bb16a44be6756beb48e27ff93d","user":{"login":"shengminw","id":107378995,"node_id":"U_kgDOBmZ5Mw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107378995?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw","html_url":"https://github.com/shengminw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506484966,"node_id":"R_kgDOHjBY5g","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"shengminw/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shengminw","id":107378995,"node_id":"U_kgDOBmZ5Mw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107378995?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw","html_url":"https://github.com/shengminw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengminw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shengminw/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue.

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

`org.apache.rocketmq.client.impl.consumer.DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl#popDelayLevel`, instead of from the 4th element (120s).\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License
