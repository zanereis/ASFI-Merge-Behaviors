shown in issue #27957, the current documentation for the `S3ToRedshift` Operator seems to indicate that only one key from S3 can be transferred to Redshift. However, as elaborated [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30869340/aws-redshift-copy-data-from-s3-with-wildcard) and in the aws docs [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/copy-parameters-data-source-s3.html#copy-parameters-data-source-s3-examples), the `COPY` command from S3 to Redshift automatically looks for **all** keys that matches the given prefix, and then copies all of them to redshift. \r\n\r\nFor this PR, I wanted to update the docs to make this clear to Airflow users. I also added a system test that displays this functionality.","created_at":"2023-01-03T20:28:58Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T08:11:50Z","closed_at":"2023-01-06T08:11:49Z","merged_at":"2023-01-06T08:11:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"3a7cb66784894b414a4c8d6e5020030fe90d8384","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eladkal","id":45845474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODQ1NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45845474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal","html_url":"https://github.com/eladkal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

only supported installing `pip` from released packages with a version number, but since `pip` does not support RC candidates (as extensively discussed in https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10882) we cannot use the `pip` RC versions to do that.\r\n\r\nWe still want to help `pip` maintainers and be able to test the versions they release as early as possible, so we add support to install `pip` in our toolchain from a GitHub URL.\r\n\r\nThat will allow us to test new `pip` version as soon as designated branch of `pip` will contain something resembling a release candidate ready for

Also, tooltips are added to the queued state boxes in gantt charts to provide related info(start time, duration, etc.). Previously, the gantt chart only shows the tasks after they have start. By having queued state tracking in Gantt chart, it would be easier for airflow users to troubleshoot performance issue in DAG's.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nTested this change in my local airflow dev environment using example DAG's. \r\n\r\nScreenshot of updated gantt chart of a sample DAG run:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27112484/210104028-1dcba80e-5c35-4eee-a46c-0987f98e388d.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in a newsfragment file, named `{pr_number}.significant.rst` or `{issue_number}.significant.rst`, in [newsfragments](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/main/newsfragments).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-03T03:46:46Z","updated_at":"2023-02-27T22:59:18Z","closed_at":"2023-01-19T00:58:30Z","merged_at":"2023-01-19T00:58:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"ab1629006fd60a85ba582f715f8f51f63f0fa9f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172800850,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwODUw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:improvement","name":"type:improvement","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Improvements"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

We assume the data is presorted (user has provided an ORDER BY clause in their SQL statement) and then write files based on changes in values to those partition columns.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nAs a simple test case, I created a test dag that writes data from the Airflow metadata DB (postgres) to GCS:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.postgres_to_gcs import PostgresToGCSOperator\r\n\r\nDEFAULT_TASK_ARGS = {\r\n    \"owner\": \"gcp-data-platform\",\r\n    \"retries\": 1,\r\n    \"retry_delay\": 10,\r\n    \"start_date\": \"2022-08-01\",\r\n}\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    max_active_runs=1,\r\n    concurrency=2,\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n    schedule_interval=\"@daily\",\r\n    dag_id=\"test_postgres\",\r\n    default_args=DEFAULT_TASK_ARGS,\r\n) as dag:\r\n\r\n    test_postgres_to_gcs = PostgresToGCSOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"test_postgres_to_gcs\",\r\n        postgres_conn_id=\"postgres_default\",\r\n        sql=\"\"\"\r\n        SELECT\r\n            conn_id,\r\n            conn_type\r\n        FROM connection\r\n        ORDER BY conn_id\r\n        LIMIT 10\r\n        \"\"\",\r\n        export_format=\"csv\",\r\n        gcp_conn_id=\"google_cloud_default\",\r\n        bucket=\"my-bucket\",\r\n        filename=\"vchiapaikeo/sql-to-gcs/connections/csv/file_{}.csv\",\r\n        stringify_dict=True,\r\n        partition_columns=[\"conn_id\"],\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nRan the dag:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9200263/210246666-a5ff6d26-a747-45b8-98fb-5b1fa1b47bba.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nTask Logs:\r\n```\r\n[2023-01-02, 14:45:04 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1084} INFO - Dependencies all met for <TaskInstance: test_postgres.test_postgres_to_gcs scheduled__2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00 [queued]>\r\n[2023-01-02, 14:45:04 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1084} INFO - Dependencies all met for <TaskInstance: test_postgres.test_postgres_to_gcs scheduled__2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00 [queued]>\r\n[2023-01-02, 14:45:04 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1282} INFO - \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[2023-01-02, 14:45:04 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1283} INFO - Starting attempt 9 of 10\r\n[2023-01-02, 14:45:04 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1284} INFO - \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[2023-01-02, 14:45:04 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1303} INFO - Executing <Task(PostgresToGCSOperator): test_postgres_to_gcs> on 2023-01-01 00:00:00+00:00\r\n[2023-01-02, 14:45:04 UTC] {standard_task_runner.py:55} INFO - Started process 339 to run task\r\n[2023-01-02, 14:45:04 UTC] {standard_task_runner.py:82} INFO - Running: ['***', 'tasks', 'run', 'test_postgres', 'test_postgres_to_gcs', 'scheduled__2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00', '--job-id', '13', '--raw', '--subdir', 'DAGS_FOLDER/test_postgres.py', '--cfg-path', '/tmp/tmp2yqzsfli']\r\n[2023-01-02, 14:45:04 UTC] {standard_task_runner.py:83} INFO - Job 13: Subtask test_postgres_to_gcs\r\n[2023-01-02, 14:45:04 UTC] {task_command.py:389} INFO - Running <TaskInstance: test_postgres.test_postgres_to_gcs scheduled__2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00 [running]> on host 29f49d0114bf\r\n[2023-01-02, 14:45:04 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1512} INFO - Exporting the following env vars:\r\nAIRFLOW_CTX_DAG_OWNER=gcp-data-platform\r\nAIRFLOW_CTX_DAG_ID=test_postgres\r\nAIRFLOW_CTX_TASK_ID=test_postgres_to_gcs\r\nAIRFLOW_CTX_EXECUTION_DATE=2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\r\nAIRFLOW_CTX_TRY_NUMBER=9\r\nAIRFLOW_CTX_DAG_RUN_ID=scheduled__2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\r\n[2023-01-02, 14:45:04 UTC] {sql_to_gcs.py:150} INFO - Found partition columns: conn_id.

This means that any change to system tests would trigger \"all tests\" rather than selective subset of those - the same as any core change.\r\n\r\nHowever System tests are also part of the documentation, so any change in system tests should trigger docs\r\nbuilds.\r\n\r\nThis change improves it in a few ways:\r\n\r\n* Other tests now do not include \"System Tests\" - they are treated the same way as other test categories (but not included in test category selection for now - until we get a good way of breeze-integration for System Tests\r\n\r\n* They are also excluded from treating them as \"other\" change when considering which tests to run. Changes to system tests will not trigger \"all\" tests, just those that accompanying changes would trigger.\r\n\r\n* The changes to system tests only, however, triggers docs build because those are triggered by any source change.a\r\n\r\n* The __pycache__ directories are removed from the list of \"Other\" packages to run.\r\n\r\n* In order to make sure system tests are pytest-collectable, we perform pytest collection for all tests right after downloading the CI images and verifying them. This makes sure that the tests are collectible before we even attempt to run them - this way we avoid unnecessary machine spin-up and breze installation for the multiple jobs that run the tests. This slows down feedback time a litle, but should increase overall robustness of the test suite.\r\n\r\n* an old, unused nosetest collection script doing the same in the past has been removed (it was discovered during implementation)\r\n\r\nNoticed in: #28319\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

if a mapped task is not yet expanded when the trigger rule dep is evaluated, it would raise an exception and fail the scheduler. This adds an additional try-except to guard against this.\r\n\r\nThe problematic scenario is when a mapped task depends on another mapped task, and its trigger rule is evaluated before that other mapped task is expanded (e.g. the other task also has a task-mapping dependency that is not yet finished). Since we can be certain the upstream task has not yet satisfy the expansion dep, we can simply declare the task we're checking as unsatisfied.","created_at":"2022-12-26T10:27:25Z","updated_at":"2023-02-03T10:04:41Z","closed_at":"2022-12-28T15:47:12Z","merged_at":"2022-12-28T15:47:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"d4dbb0077aec33e5b3b4793bf9e2902e6cbdaa7f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

PR is by request from @potiuk here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/28505#discussion_r1053738869\r\n\r\nHe wanted a succinct description of the breaking changes I introduced. I mention that JSON secrets for the AWS `SecretsManagerBackend` no longer do anything regarding urlencoding. I added a sub-bullet to clarify how this differs from the 5.x change, since at first glance they seem like they're indistinguishable changes.\r\n\r\nThe changelog is meant to be very short and to the point. To keep things brief, I omitted two things:\r\n\r\n* I do _not_ mention the removal of `ast.literal_eval()` for `json.loads` because this was never a documented behavior, and a reasonable coder should have known better than to use invalid JSONs.\r\n* I also never mention that `get_conn_value()` can return a JSON because as of 6.1.0, the AWS provider package was already locked in base Airflow version `>=2.3.0` where this behavior is already assumed to be a supported (i.e. the base implementation for the method `get_connection()` calls `get_conn_value()`, and then checks whether it is a JSON or URL).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly how you want this formatted so let me

compilation is performed in background and especially if it is run for the first time it might take some time.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/28440 merged first.\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/28440, instead of having a task logger both at `airflow.task` and root logger, we only have it at root logger.  This means we can remove the logic to set propagate=False, because there's no longer a risk of record processed by FTH twice.  \r\n\r\nIt also means we can remove the logic to walk up the logger hierarchy and set context because we don't need to hit both airflow.task and root -- there will only ever be one such handler instance.\r\n\r\nFor file processor, we can go back to the old approach where we optionally disable propagation by returning a sentinel value, rather than disabling by default.
