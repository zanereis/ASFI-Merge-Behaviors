refactoring is discussed in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3624#discussion_r132614639. More specifically:\r\n\r\n1. Moved the access of `StreamThread` in `StreamPartitionAssignor` to `TaskManager`, removed any fields stored in `StreamThread` such as `processId` and `clientId` that are only to be used in `StreamPartitionAssignor`, and pass them to `TaskManager` if necessary.\r\n2. Moved any in-memory states, `metadataWithInternalTopics`, `partitionsByHostState`, `standbyTasks`, `activeTasks` to `TaskManager` so that `StreamPartitionAssignor` becomes a stateless thin layer that access TaskManager directly.\r\n3. Remove the reference of `StreamPartitionAssignor` in `StreamThread`, instead consolidate all related functionalities such as `cachedTasksIds ` in `TaskManager` which could be retrieved by the `StreamThread` and the `StreamPartitionAssignor` directly.\r\n4. Finally, removed the two interfaces used for `StreamThread` and `StreamPartitionAssignor`.\r\n\r\n5. Some minor fixes on logPrefixes, etc.\r\n\r\nFuture work: when replacing the StreamsKafkaClient, we would let `StreamPartitionAssignor` to retrieve it from `TaskManager` directly, and also its closing call do not need to be called (`KafkaStreams` will be responsible for closing it).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-16T00:16:42Z","updated_at":"2018-02-14T19:51:54Z","closed_at":"2017-11-28T17:39:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"69f68fbf2bad8a6ef702d626256a7e9615489a76","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4224/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4224/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/4224/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/3c1a062e66322edb296cda93d6cde3ab7181a755","head":{"label":"guozhangwang:K6170-refactor-assignor","ref":"K6170-refactor-assignor","sha":"3c1a062e66322edb296cda93d6cde3ab7181a755","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39164613,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTE2NDYxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"guozhangwang/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka","description":"Mirror

PR removes the need to keep a reference to the parsed `AbstractRequest` after it's been handled in `KafkaApis`.  A reference to `RequestAndSize` which holds the parsed `AbstractRequest` in  `RequestChannel.Request` was kept in scope as a consequence of being passed into the `RequestChannel.Response` after being handled.  \r\n\r\nThe Jira ticket [KAFKA-5859](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-5859) suggests removing this reference as soon as it's no longer needed.  I considered several implementations and I settled on creating a new type that contains all the relevant information of the Request that is required after it has been handled.  I think this approach allows for the least amount of invasive changes in the Request/Response lifecycle while retaining the immutability of the `RequestChannel.Request`.\r\n\r\nA new type called `RequestChannel.RequestSummary` now contains much of the information that was in `RequestChannel.Request` before.  The `RequestChannel.Request` now generates a `RequestChannel.RequestSummary` that is passed into the `RequestChannel.Response` after being handled in `KafkaApis`.  `RequestChannel.RequestSummary` contains information such as:\r\n\r\n* A detailed and non-detailed description of the request\r\n* Metrics associated with the request\r\n* Helper methods to update various Request metrics\r\n* A special case describing whether or not the original Request was a `FetchRequest` and whether it was from a follower.  This information is required in the `updateRequestMetrics` metrics helper method.\r\n\r\nThis change does not make any behaviour changes so no additional tests were added.  I've verified that all unit and integration tests pass and no regressions were introduced.  I'm interested in seeing the before and after results of the Confluent Kafka system tests as described in step 11 of the [Contributing Code Changes](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Contributing+Code+Changes#ContributingCodeChanges-PullRequest) section.  I would like to request access to kick off this system tests suite if you agree that it's relevant to this ticket.\r\n\r\nThis is my first contribution to this project.  I picked up this issue because it was marked with the newbie flag and it seemed like a good opportunity to learn more about about the request and response lifecycle in the Kafka broker.\r\n\r\n###

eventually replace StreamsKafkaClient):\r\n3.1. \"clientId\" tag will be set as \"clientId-admin\": in StreamsKafkaClient it is whatever user sets, and hence could even be null.\r\n3.2. \"groupPrefix\" will be set as \"admin-client\": in StreamsKafkaClient it will be \"kafka-client\".\r\n\r\nSo the metrics from `StreamsKafkaClient` to `AdminClient` would be changed
