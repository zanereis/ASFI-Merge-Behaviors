Description\r\n\r\nPreviously, when new CVEs were reported, the security vulnerability scan would unfortunately block PRs that did not modify any dependencies. To prevent this issue, the security scan is now run as a Travis cron job that runs on master and notifies the druid dev list if it fails. The security scan has also been added to the \"apache-release\" maven profile, to ensure that it passes before a release.\r\n\r\nAlso adjusted some Travis CI job failure help messages to not be folded in the Travis CI job logs.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR is merged, I'll update the Apache Druid Travis CI settings to run a daily cronjob on master (which will run just the security scan job).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar

Maybe @nishantmonu51 can speak to if my solve properly mirrors his initial fix.\r\n\r\nOn my local I can reproduce each time by building the sql module without these changes and then remediate by applying these changes. As I said above, I liberally slapped the class extension on each new class that I identified in Calcite as I was working on a different effort when this popped up after merging master into my branch. Hoping Nishant can quickly identify if my application was overkill and I can remove in un-needed locations.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

#9311.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n`Transform` is a useful place for 3rd party developers to add their own extensions. Informally this has been an available extension point since 2017. This PR proposes adding the compatibility guarantees of @ExtensionPoint.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n\r\nToDo:\r\n- [x] Add documentation changes to https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/development/modules.html#writing-your-own-extensions\r\n\r\nIt makes sense to me to add a new item in the list of 15 items under \"Writing your own extensions\" for completeness sake. I'd be happy to write a dedicated section of these docs, although I think this page seems destined to be split into many pages: one describing the approach for each kind of extension.

Description\r\nI went through a ton of logs to try and spot places where we could be potentially logging a large number of segments or other unnecessarily large things to try and ensure that logging doesn't ever destroy us, in response to such a thing happening from log containing [`SegmentTransactionalInsertAction.toString`](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/indexing-service/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/indexing/common/actions/SegmentTransactionalInsertAction.java#L308) with a very large number of segments (exaggerated by the fact that it was using the whole `DataSegment` rather than the `SegmentId`). To avoid this happening even with `SegmentId`, I added a utility method and set of log methods to `Logger`, dedicated to logging chunks of 64 `SegmentIds` at a time to ensure we will never create a gigantic string to log containing all of the segments no matter how many segments are involved because each message should be sized in the tens of kilobytes.\r\n\r\nThere remain two areas that exceptions thrown in `SegmentLockHelper`, one in `tryLockSegments` the other in `verifySegmentGranularity` which could I guess create giant strings if you have absurd numbers of segments you are trying to lock, but I was unsure how likely this is to happen and if worth adding a logger here.\r\n\r\nI will admit that it is possible this PR is over-correcting, and just ensuring that we always use `commaSeparatedIdentifiers` would be sufficient for all but absurdly large numbers of segments... but I guess does take logs as the culprit out of the equation if we do decide it necessary support such scenarios.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

some key differences to improve speed and design simplicity:\r\n\r\n1) Uses Memory rather than ByteBuffer for its backing storage.\r\n2) Uses faster hashing and comparison routines (see HashTableUtils).\r\n3) Capacity is always a power of two, allowing simpler design and more\r\n   efficient implementation of findBucket.\r\n4) Does not implement growability; instead, leaves that to its callers.\r\n   The idea is this removes the need for subclasses, while still giving\r\n   callers flexibility in how to handle table-full scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe combination of these techniques above can boost performance of\r\nper-segment groupBy processing on realistic queries by 30%+ (in some\r\ncases I tested, it was even more extreme: 2–4x when grouping by single\r\nlong dimensions).\r\n\r\nThe idea is that in time, users of ByteBufferHashTable will be migrated\r\nto this implementation.","created_at":"2020-02-04T02:01:22Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T23:17:50Z","closed_at":"2020-02-05T03:58:00Z","merged_at":"2020-02-05T03:58:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"3ef5c2f2e87d07c48eccdcafd8c08ce9bf657162","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":120288359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAyODgzNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

PR adds an initial implementation for pushing down filters to the base table in a join query.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of logic added is in the new JoinFilterAnalyzer utils class. This class has methods that split a Filter into a base table portion that can be pushed down and a post-join portion. The analyzer is capable of rewriting filters that apply to columns on the join tables into filters on the base table.\r\n\r\nCurrent limitations:\r\n- Only selector filters can be rewritten\r\n- IS NULL filters are not pushed down\r\n- There is currently no limit on the IN filter size for rewrites, future work can improve the heuristics for deciding when to rewrite filters\r\n- The filter push down could benefit from more efficient lookups for values of non-key columns in Joinables\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n *

PR adds a dedicated thread to execute callbacks of task status updates attached by `TaskQueue ` and then the specific thread which notifies the change of task status can return as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nFound that tasks sometimes are failed to assign within the default timeout(5 minutes) but the tasks were actually already running on middleManager according to the logs.\r\nAlso found that the thread of pendingTasksExec, which supposed to be notified with the task status changing within the timeout, fails to be waked up. \r\n\r\nAfter diving into this issue, I think I have found the root cause. The Guava concurrent framework will schedule the callback to be run by this syncer thread and the task syncer thread possibly get stuck if it waits in the giant lock. \r\nBoth the `remote` and `httpRemote` task runner have this issue.\r\n\r\nSince the callback handler attached by TaskQueue seem a bit heavyweight, it will be better to provide a dedicated thread to execute these callbacks. \r\nThis issue can be fixed by adding a single thread executor to handle callbacks attached by `TaskQueue`.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the example `docker-compose.yml` file to be more 'quickstart' friendly, opting to configure it to mount a local directory to share between containers as deep storage so that it can potentially run out of the box, as well as run all of the services on the default port. I also removed the overlord since the coordinator was also configured to be an overlord.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it adds Java 11 version of the Dockerfile, and I updated the Docker README.md to include reference to it, though mentioning it as experimental. I ran some tests with it and everything appeared to function for me, though I only ran through the native batch quick-start and ran several queries.\r\n\r\nTry it out and let me know what you find:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker build -t apache/druid:0.18.0-SNAPSHOT-java11 -f distribution/docker/Dockerfile.java11 .\r\n```\r\n\r\nand modify the `docker-compose.yml` to use the `0.18.0-SNAPSHOT-java11` or whatever you call your tag.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, it adds a rough 'getting started' with Docker page to the website documentation:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1291\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-01-27 at 1 33 09

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue with predicate filters, such as a bound filter, on long columns with numeric nulls, where it will incorrectly compare `0` instead of calling `predicate.applyNull()`. The correct code is actually in place already in `LongValueMatcherColumnSelectorStrategy`, but this was getting pre-empted by `Filters.makeValueMatcher` which had it's own predicate defined specifically handling long columns, along with a code comment:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// This should be folded into the ValueMatcherColumnSelectorStrategy once that can handle LONG typed columns.\r\n```\r\nUnfortunately, it just hadn't been done yet.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the added `testLongPredicateFilterNulls` in `CalciteQueryTest` would fail with an error of the form:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.segment.data.ColumnarLongs$1HistoricalLongColumnSelectorWithNulls.getLong(ColumnarLongs.java:124)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.segment.filter.Filters$4.matches(Filters.java:467)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.segment.FilteredOffset.increment(FilteredOffset.java:75)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.segment.QueryableIndexCursorSequenceBuilder$QueryableIndexCursor.advance(QueryableIndexCursorSequenceBuilder.java:417)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.query.timeseries.TimeseriesQueryEngine.lambda$processNonVectorized$2(TimeseriesQueryEngine.java:288)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile adding tests for this fix, I also encountered an issue with the `JavascriptDimFilter`, which did not implement `applyNull` for it's predicate, causing it to be unable to feed null values into javascript filter functions.\r\n\r\nI also ran into some issues with vectorized value and predicate matchers on numeric null columns. The initial issue is that the matchers were not checking the null vector, however once that was in place I bumped into another issue that the null vector could be incorrectly polluted with the wrong null information in the case where the null bitmap ran out of values before the end of the column (likely) because it was breaking from the loop instead of writing false values until the end vector offset.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-24T09:19:23Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T23:18:22Z","closed_at":"2020-01-28T02:01:02Z","merged_at":"2020-01-28T02:01:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"36c5efe2ab88e03b804eb20bf1f138fae2ef1cf9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

There is no change to the existing set of integration test.\r\nNote 2: For the integration tests that has runtime using Java 11, our dependencies (kafka, zookeeper, etc) will also be run with Java 11.\r\nNote 3: Need to remove PrintGCTimeStamps since it's no longer valid in Java 11.

\"withChildren\" methods to DataSource, which will be used\r\n   in the future for query rewriting (e.g. inlining of subqueries).\r\n\r\nDataSource analysis functionality:\r\n\r\n1) Add DataSourceAnalysis class, which breaks down datasources into three components:\r\n   outer queries, a base datasource (left-most of the highest level left-leaning join\r\n   tree), and other joined-in leaf datasources (the right-hand branches of the\r\n   left-leaning join tree).\r\n2) Add \"isConcrete\", \"isGlobal\", and \"isCacheable\" methods to DataSource in order to\r\n   support analysis.\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n\r\n1) Renamed DataSource#getNames to DataSource#getTableNames, which I think is clearer.\r\n   Also, made it a Set, so implementations don't need to worry about

on #9111 and implements the datasource analysis mentioned in #8728. Still can't\r\nhandle join datasources, but we're a step closer.\r\n\r\nJoin-related DataSource types:\r\n\r\n1) Add \"join\", \"lookup\", and \"inline\" datasources.\r\n2) Add \"getChildren\" and \"withChildren\" methods to DataSource, which will be used\r\n   in the future for query rewriting (e.g. inlining of subqueries).\r\n\r\nDataSource analysis functionality:\r\n\r\n1) Add **DataSourceAnalysis** class, which breaks down datasources into three components:\r\n   outer queries, a base datasource (left-most of the highest level left-leaning join\r\n   tree), and other joined-in leaf datasources (the right-hand branches of the\r\n   left-leaning join tree).\r\n2) Add \"isConcrete\", \"isGlobal\", and \"isCacheable\" methods to DataSource in order to\r\n   support analysis.\r\n3) Use the DataSourceAnalysis methods throughout the query handling stack, replacing\r\n   various ad-hoc approaches. Most of the interesting changes are in\r\n   **ClientQuerySegmentWalker** (brokers), **ServerManager** (historicals), and\r\n   **SinkQuerySegmentWalker** (indexing tasks).\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n\r\n1) Changed **TimelineServerView** to return an Optional timeline, which I thought made\r\n   the analysis changes cleaner to implement.\r\n2) Renamed DataSource#getNames to **DataSource#getTableNames**, which I think is clearer.\r\n   Also, made it a Set, so implementations don't need to worry about duplicates.\r\n3) Added **QueryToolChest#canPerformSubquery**, which is now used by query entry points to\r\n   determine whether it is safe to pass a subquery dataSource to the query toolchest.\r\n   Fixes an issue introduced in #5471 where subqueries under non-groupBy-typed queries\r\n   were silently ignored, since neither the query entry point nor the toolchest did\r\n   anything special with them.\r\n4) The addition of \"isCacheable\" should work around #8713, since UnionDataSource now\r\n   returns false for cacheability.","created_at":"2020-01-21T06:43:17Z","updated_at":"2020-01-21T18:59:58Z","closed_at":"2020-01-21T18:59:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"868fcb9e7606992c87d5793126110b1d9ebb1761","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\nAdd a new dynamic configuration for the Coordinator service. This configuration allows the coordinator to be paused. By paused, I mean that it doesn't execute Coordinator Helpers every coordination interval. Instead, if it is paused it simply logs an info log saying that it is paused and won't run the helpers. \r\n\r\nWhat prompted this at my organization is the need to execute maintenance with downtime on our HDFS name nodes that are running the HDFS cluster used for deep store. We don't want the coordinator executing any of its jobs during this maintenance, but we also don't want to have to take the coordinator hard down because during the maintenance we need to restart our historical nodes with new config files to talk to hdfs and historical nodes talk to the coordinator at startup.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9220.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe tuningConfig type has changed in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8570, but the compaction task should be able to read the spec of the old version for rolling upgrades. In this PR, I had to register `IndexTuningConfig` and `ParallelIndexTuningConfig` as subtypes of `TuningConfig` in `IndexingServiceTuningConfigModule` because they are not properly registered on the `ObjectMapper` with the `@JsonTypeName` annotation. This applies only to the compaction task as it takes the `TuningConfig` interface as a constructor parameter. Other tasks accept a concrete class and don't need to be changed.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis adds a new built-in extraction function to coalesce missing values to a provided value. I'd be happy to find out that there's an existing good way to do this; I ended up with a query like this: \r\n```\r\n...\r\n  \"dimensions\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"extraction\",\r\n      \"dimension\": \"field_name\",\r\n      \"outputName\": \"output_field_name\",\r\n      \"extractionFn\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"regex\",\r\n        \"expr\": \"(.+)\",\r\n        \"replaceMissingValue\": true,\r\n        \"replaceMissingValueWith\": \"0\"\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is obviously a roundabout way of achieving what I want to accomplish, but I couldn't find any other way to do this using the existing built-in extraction functions. (It also can't quite be done with the map-based `lookup` extractor). I'd be happy to learn if there's a better approach (?). \r\n\r\nThis PR provides an extraction function that allows you to directly execute this 'coalesce null values' operation. You'd configure it like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n  \"dimensions\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"extraction\",\r\n      \"dimension\": \"field_name\",\r\n      \"outputName\": \"output_field_name\",\r\n      \"extractionFn\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"replaceMissing\",\r\n        \"replaceMissingValueWith\": \"0\"\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt does this by extending `FunctionalExtraction` (passing in the identity function) and configuring the null replacement options in that class. Nothing too complicated.\r\n\r\nIf this seems useful, I'm happy to update documentation/tests/etc as needed in this PR, but didn't want to go through that effort if already a better way to do this that I just didn't find. :) \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed, *although I'm only passingly familiar with the Druid codebase*.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.
