is using ```Fetcher``` to open ```InputStream```s for input objects. ```Fetcher``` has two modes. If prefetch is enabled, it first downloads objects one by one in local disks and opens ```FileInputStream```s for downloaded files. If prefetch is disabled, it directly opens ```InputStream```s from the objects. In the later mode, ```Fetcher``` currently doesn't support retrying on failures, which makes difficult to use if the input source is error-prone. This patch is to support retrying for the later mode.\r\n\r\nThe retrying on failures in the prefetch mode is also improved to use the exponential backoff mechanism.\r\n\r\n<!-- Reviewable:start

#5156 \r\n\r\nchanges:\r\n* `TimewarpOperator` will now compensate for daylight savings time shifts between date translation ranges for queries using a `PeriodGranularity` with a timezone defined\r\n* The `Query` interface has been expanded with 2 new methods, `getGranularity` and `getTimezone`.\r\n* `BaseQuery` now has a `Granularity` and a new constructor that takes an additional argument to set it. When using the original constructor, granularity will be set to `Granularities.ALL`. \r\n* The `getTimezone` method in `BaseQuery` will return the `PeriodGranularity` timezone if it is used, else it will default to `DateTimeZone.UTC`. \r\n* `GroupByQuery`, `SearchQuery`, `SelectQuery`, `TimeseriesQuery`, and `TopNQuery` all individually had a granularity, so this change to `Query` and `BaseQuery` cuts down on some duplicate code in addition providing a mechanism for `TimewarpOperator` (and anything else) that needs to be aware of query granularity or timezone. \r\n* The changes to `BaseQuery` result in serialization differences for `DataSourceMetadataQuery`, `SegmentMetadataQuery`, `ScanQuery`, and `TimeBoundaryQuery`, which previously did not have a granularity, but are now set to `Granularities.ALL`.","created_at":"2017-12-13T09:21:01Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:38:17Z","closed_at":"2018-01-11T20:39:34Z","merged_at":"2018-01-11T20:39:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"491f8cca81349662a89444f00a61d393b6f8cd9f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

this patch, the coordinator periodically deletes pendingSegments from the ```pendingSegments``` table. You can test by adding ```druid.coordinator.kill.pendingSegments.on=true``` to your coordinator configuration file.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I added ```TaskStatusPlus``` which contains taskId, createdTime, queueInsertionTime, taskState, runningDuration, and taskLocation. We currently have 4 similar classes, i.e., ```TaskStatus```, ```TaskRunnerWorkItem```, ```TaskResponseObject``` in ```OverlordResource```, and ```TaskResponseObject``` for integration tests, but they are designed to be used in some specific classes. I would love to add a new one to represent all these classes and remove others, but it will cause a lot of code changes which makes difficult to be done together in this PR. So, in this PR, \r\n- TaskResponseObjects are replaced by TaskStatusPlus and moved to ```druid-api```. This is to use the same class when coordinators call overlord APIs.\r\n- The ```Status``` enum in ```TaskStatus``` is extracted as a separate ```TaskState``` enumeration and moved to ```druid-api```.\r\n- ```TaskLocation``` is moved to ```druid-api```.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n---\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\"

the MySQL versions  5.5.45+, 5.6.26+ and 5.7.6+,  it is required that SSL connection must be explicitly enabled or disabled by default. Since this cannot be done with our existing code, MySQL would keep spewing warning messages everytime about explicitly enabling/disabling SSL on the connection. \r\nThis PR includes changes to support SSL/TLS encryption on MySQL connections.

idea is a maxEntrySize makes it more feasible to cache query types that\r\ncan potentially generate large result sets, like groupBy and select,\r\nwithout fear of writing too much to the cache per query.\r\n\r\nIncludes a refactor of cache population code in CachingQueryRunner and\r\nCachingClusteredClient, such that they now use the same CachePopulator\r\ninterface with two implementations: one for foreground and one for\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for splitting the foreground / background impls is\r\nthat the foreground impl can have a more efficient implementation of\r\nmaxEntrySize. It can stop retaining subvalues for the cache early.\r\n\r\nAlso includes:\r\n\r\n- New cache populator metrics: `put/ok`, `put/errors`, `put/oversized`.\r\n- Removed groupBy from default uncacheable list, since the main reason it was uncacheable was that its cached values could be too

the method DimensionSelectorUtils.cacheIfPossible to aid with\r\ncreation of caches for evaluating functions of dimension dictionary IDs.\r\nUses an array cache when possible, an LRU cache when it seems like it\r\nmight be a good idea, and skips caching otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe caches are used in three places in this patch:\r\n\r\n- Cardinality aggregator (caches hashes)\r\n- Single-dimension-input expression selector (caches expression results)\r\n- Generic expression selector (caches name for any dimension inputs)\r\n\r\nBenchmarking showed that both caches help when there are repeated values,\r\nbut also the LRU cache could introduce unwanted overhead for dimensions\r\nwith few repeating values, so this patch implements two mitigations:\r\n\r\n- Skip caching completely if cardinality is >90% of the row count.\r\n- After iterating through a few multiples of the cache size, examine\r\n  the cache hit rate and decide to either freeze it (the cache becomes\r\n  read-only) or ignore it (the cache is cleared and future operations\r\n  are uncached).\r\n\r\nThe caches aim to be 1MB or less per column.","created_at":"2017-11-20T23:43:05Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T19:21:56Z","closed_at":"2019-01-08T18:41:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"501b98d6993b4588466dbcae6f7a7505d4631dd3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":120288359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAyODgzNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":533766549,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MzM3NjY1NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/WIP","name":"WIP","color":"b60205","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/5106/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/5106/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5106/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/03cdf5ad52385f0406ddde251addf0a8813ed64e","head":{"label":"gianm:dimension-id-eval-caches","ref":"dimension-id-eval-caches","sha":"03cdf5ad52385f0406ddde251addf0a8813ed64e","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28350072,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODM1MDA3Mg==","name":"druid","full_name":"gianm/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gianm/druid","description":"Real²time

of https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/4479.\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces the automatic compaction by coordinators.\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nEach run, the Druid coordinator compacts small segments abutting each other. It first finds the segments to compact together based on the _segment search policy_. Once it finds some segments, it launches a compactTask to compact those segments. The maximum number of running compact tasks is limited by `max(sum of worker capacity * compactionTaskSlotRatio, 1)`.\r\n\r\n### Segment Search Policy\r\n\r\nCurrently there is only one segment search policy, newest segment first policy.\r\n\r\n#### Newest Segment First Policy\r\n\r\nThis policy searches the segments of _all dataSources_ in inverse order of their intervals.\r\nFor example, let me assume there are 3 dataSources (`ds1`, `ds2`, `ds3`) and 5 segments (`seg_ds1_2017-10-01_2017-10-02`, `seg_ds1_2017-11-01_2017-11-02`, `seg_ds2_2017-08-01_2017-08-02`, `seg_ds3_2017-07-01_2017-07-02`, `seg_ds3_2017-12-01_2017-12-02`) for those dataSources. The segment name indicates its dataSource and interval. The search result of newestSegmentFirstPolicy is [`seg_ds3_2017-12-01_2017-12-02`, `seg_ds1_2017-11-01_2017-11-02`, `seg_ds1_2017-10-01_2017-10-02`, `seg_ds2_2017-08-01_2017-08-02`, `seg_ds3_2017-07-01_2017-07-02`]. \r\n\r\nEvery run, this policy starts searching segments for the (very latest interval - skipOffsetFromLatest). This is to handle the late segments ingested to realtime dataSources.\r\n\r\nThis policy currenlty cannot handle the situation when a shard consists of a lot of small segments, thereby its total size exceeds the targetCompactionSizebytes. If it finds such shards, it simply skips them.\r\n\r\nI did some benchmark for the performance of this policy. It took about 1 seconds to iterate 10000000 segments in my mac. I think it's fine because 1) having such many segments is not common and 2) the term between each run of this policy is usually much larger than 1 seconds (it's 30 mins by default).\r\n\r\n## How you can test it\r\n\r\nYou can post, get, and delete a compaction config for a dataSource with a new coordinator API ```http://{COORDINATOR_IP:PORT}/druid/coordinator/v1/config/{dataSource}```.\r\n\r\nA sample compaction config is:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"dataSource\": \"wikiticker\",\r\n  \"targetCompactionSizeBytes\": 800000000,\r\n  \"skipOffsetFromLatest\": \"P1D\"\r\n}\r\n```\n\n<!--

PR adds an extension that provides implementations of the auth interfaces introduced in #4271 :\r\n- an Authenticator which supports HTTP Basic authentication\r\n- an Escalator which supports HTTP Basic authentication\r\n- an Authorizer which implements basic role-based access control\r\n\r\nWith the large amount of changes (almost a rewrite) from the last round of PR reviews on #4823, I felt like it would be easier to close the old PR and start a fresh one.\r\n\r\nSome design notes:\r\n- The user/role information is stored in the metadata store, using the \"druid_config\" table as a key-value store, user/role maps are stored as serialized byte arrays\r\n- On the coordinator a *MetadataStorageUpdater class is responsible for handling writes to the user/role DB and holds a deserialized cached copy of the latest DB state\r\n- Each node has a *CacheManager instance that polls the coordinator for the latest DB state periodically, this also syncs the auth DB state at startup time\r\n- The coordinator can also notify and push updates to remote nodes, using the *CacheNotifier classes\r\n- The BasicHTTPAuthenticator and BasicRoleBasedAuthorizer perform their checks using cached info from the *CacheManager instance, to avoid overloading the coordinator\r\n- The coordinator nodes have a jersey resource for configuring the auth DB, which also holds the endpoint that nodes poll to get the latest DB state\r\n- A jersey resource is also installed on non-coordinator nodes, containing an endpoint that listens for DB state updates\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-17T02:20:32Z","updated_at":"2018-11-21T02:49:41Z","closed_at":"2017-12-14T18:36:04Z","merged_at":"2017-12-14T18:36:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"f48c9d7be111a0061cef773f8feebace514d685a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287687,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"2ceefb","default":false,"description":null},{"id":692855937,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTI4NTU5Mzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Security","name":"Security","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/24","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/24","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/24/labels","id":2781414,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMjc4MTQxNA==","number":24,"title":"0.12.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":203,"state":"closed","created_at":"2017-09-20T20:11:45Z","updated_at":"2018-10-08T22:02:59Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2018-03-13T21:58:49Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/5099/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/5099/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5099/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/895ce3e7c4f5b7d871386d2fe2c02dc65fe377f5","head":{"label":"jon-wei:new_basic_sec2","ref":"new_basic_sec2","sha":"895ce3e7c4f5b7d871386d2fe2c02dc65fe377f5","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":41450391,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTQ1MDM5MQ==","name":"druid","full_name":"jon-wei/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei/druid","description":"Column

https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/4373\r\n- Modify `InputRowParser` to have `List<InputRow> parseBatch(T input)` method which returns list of InputRows. Currently is has a default implementation which just wraps the output of `parse(T)` method in a list.\r\n- Changed Implementations of `InputRowParser` to implement `parseBatch` instead of `parse`, although they currently just warp the output of parsing the input in a list.\r\n- Changed all the usages of `parse` in the codebase to `parseBatch`.\r\n- Changed Firehose iterators to work on top of `parseBatch`.\r\n- Modified `Appenderator`'s `add` method to accept a flag to disable automatic persists, so that callers can decide to not persist during addition of batch of rows and can call persist later explicitly.\r\n\r\nHaving been running this code on our internal cluster with a InputRowPraser that multiplies each row a certain number of times and using KafkaIndexingService to index these rows.","created_at":"2017-11-13T20:59:34Z","updated_at":"2020-03-28T14:52:54Z","closed_at":"2017-12-04T22:06:16Z","merged_at":"2017-12-04T22:06:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"7c01f77b041fd071a0adeaad9a195407fa4e5a37","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

#2253.\r\n\r\nAnnouncerTest essentially\r\n\r\n1. Makes a PathChildrenCache for ```/``` and writes something on a ```/test1``` in background. The PathChildrenCache has an event listener for the ```CHILD_REMOVED``` event.\r\n2. Deletes ```/test1``` transactionally.\r\n3. Expects PathChildrenCache recreates the removed path on ```CHILD_REMOVED``` event.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the delete in the second step is performed before the write in the first step is finished, PathChildrenCache never receives ```CHILD_REMOVED``` event. \r\n\r\nI fixed this issue by waiting for the ```/test1``` path to be created before calling the delete operation. However, I'm still concerned with that this issue may exist in real applications.\r\n\r\nSince ZooKeeper and Curator offers eventual consistency, it doesn't guarantee that all events are received. So I think the best solution is to use another coordination system guaranteeing all events are seen. HTTP-based coordination system @himanshug is working on can be a good solution.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n---\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\"

that non-daemon thread actually comes from

timer to be exactly same except for using daemon threads. I tested it on my dev environment and problem appears to be solved.\r\n\r\nFor example, when I run druid code without this patch with Http emitter enabled, then I can see (in thread dump) non-daemon thread with name similar to \"pool-39-thread-1\"  and with this patch those don't exist and I see daemon threads with name like \"HttpPostEmitter-AsyncHttpClient-Timer-0\"  instead .\r\n\r\nI'll test it more on some environments, but I think this fixed the

but it would be nice to have Druid compatible with Avro 1.8.2\r\n\r\nOld Dependancy tree:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/Fokko/e2f6d805c4f9a0b70f8ff34f12c952f0\r\nNew one:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/Fokko/7bcce0b547bc79caa7bd95ad54c63a4c\r\n\r\nI did a test and I'm able to parse datetime fields in Parquet.\r\n\r\nCheers,

developing an extension for basic HTTP authentication, I encountered the following problem:\r\n\r\nThe Authenticator implementation needed to communicate with the coordinator during initialization, grabbing data from an HTTP endpoint, using a DruidLeaderClient. This led to circular dependency issues as the DruidLeaderClient needs an escalated HTTP client created by an Authenticator to successfully authenticate with the coordinator.\r\n\r\nThis PR splits the \"send requests with privileged internal system user credentials\" functionality out of the Authenticator interface into a new Escalator interface, to help avoid circular dependency issues when Authenticator extension implementations need to communicate with Druid cluster

clean this up after https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/5054 goes in.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n* Uses `ImmutableDruidDataSource` in many more places\r\n* Removes the usage of locks in `DruidServer`\r\n* Stores ONLY the segment id to object mapping in `DruidServer`. Now many things take actual immutable snapshots of `DruidServer` objects in order to do various data processing on their state from the immutable snapshot. Most of these usages bubble up to http calls, which should ideally be faster. This may cause some extra extremely short lived objects for excessive http calls, but hopefully either has equal or lesser pressure on old gen by reducing the overall needed long-term object storage.\r\n* Moves lots of the looping to a more functional approach with java 8

PR suggests two changes:\r\n\r\n1) I believe there's a race condition in `TieredBrokerHostSelector`, specifically in `NodeHolder.pick()` where multiple threads can access `roundRobinIndex`. For example, two threads can simultaneously access `roundRobinIndex` when `roundRobinIndex  == currNodes.size() - 1`, but then one of the threads will get index out of bounds error when calling `currNodes.get(roundRobinIndex++)` because the other thread had increased the value of `roundRobinIndex` by 1 already. I have encountered this situation in production, for example:\r\n```\r\n WARN [qtp658824366-145] o.e.j.s.ServletHandler - /druid/v2/ - []\r\njava.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: index (x) must be less than size (x)\r\n    at com.google.common.base.Preconditions.checkElementIndex(Preconditions.java:313) ~[guava-16.0.1.jar:?]\r\n    at com.google.common.base.Preconditions.checkElementIndex(Preconditions.java:295) ~[guava-16.0.1.jar:?]\r\n    at com.google.common.collect.RegularImmutableList.get(RegularImmutableList.java:65) ~[guava-16.0.1.jar:?]\r\n    at io.druid.server.router.TieredBrokerHostSelector$NodesHolder.pick(TieredBrokerHostSelector.java:319) ~[druid-server-0.11.0-mmx19.jar:0.11.0-mmx19]\r\n    at io.druid.server.router.TieredBrokerHostSelector.getDefaultLookup(TieredBrokerHostSelector.java:260) ~[druid-server-0.11.0-mmx19.jar:0.11.0-mmx19]\r\n    at io.druid.server.router.QueryHostFinder.findDefaultServer(QueryHostFinder.java:60) ~[druid-server-0.11.0-mmx19.jar:0.11.0-mmx19]\r\n    at io.druid.server.router.QueryHostFinder.getDefaultServer(QueryHostFinder.java:90) ~[druid-server-0.11.0-mmx19.jar:0.11.0-mmx19]\r\n    at io.druid.server.AsyncQueryForwardingServlet.service(AsyncQueryForwardingServlet.java:180) ~[druid-server-0.11.0-mmx19.jar:0.11.0-mmx19]\r\n    at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:790) ~[javax.servlet-api-3.1.0.jar:3.1.0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) I think it might make more sense to use `DefaultBrokerServiceName` instead of the last value of `tierToBrokerMap` when the priority is out of range, as I understand that the default value is the one that's used whenever there's no specific broker service name for the given query. What is the reason behind using the last entry of `tierToBrokerMap` when the priority is out of range?

on proposal #4843 , this introduces result level caching in brokers. It uses the etag functionality to identify the existence of result cache for a specific query. This is independent of the segment level caching and therefore both types of caching can be configured independently. A new query runner: ResultLevelCachingQueryRunner is introduced that performs this caching. The result level cache is populated after the merge using the query key as the cache key and merged result is saved as the cache value along with the etag information. \r\nSince query results may be large, there is a configurable parameter `resultLevelCacheLimit` that limits the size of the query response that can be cached.\r\nOne caveat to be noted is that basic object deserialization is performed while retrieving post aggregated values from the cache. Therefore this may not work with post aggregators that require a custom deserialization method.","created_at":"2017-10-31T20:40:10Z","updated_at":"2018-10-27T05:31:34Z","closed_at":"2018-03-24T02:11:53Z","merged_at":"2018-03-24T02:11:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"ec17a44e0983cd6391ba9f60a1c5571a59595b0a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287687,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"2ceefb","default":false,"description":null},{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release
