This was fine when the changelog was short, but with providers history growing, the main page became longer and longer and the generated index on the right side (from the changelog) became less and less usable, and changelog itself became far less discoverable.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces another approach. Changelog gets its own, separate page and it has quite a few positive consequences:\r\n\r\n1) we can add separate \"Changelog\" URL in PyPI so that it is\r\n   prominently visible at the TOC in PyPI URLS\r\n2) we can link to the changelog easily from stable page - without\r\n   worrrying which version we link to\r\n3) the README file is part of the package so fixing the changelog\r\n   in case of a doc-only mistake will not fix the PyPI page (it\r\n   will only be fixed in future releases)\r\n4) the link tree on the right side of the provider index page becomes back\r\n   usable\r\n5) the left-side TOD  on the provider's index page containes two\r\n   prominent links that were missing: Home (back to the index provider\r\n   page), Changelog, and Security - all under \"Basics\" link\r\n6) The TOC is not repeated in the index page itself, making the content\r\n   immediately visible rather than having to scroll trough the long\r\n   TOC (in some cases like amazon the TOC was reallly long).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

there are CLI commands that are failing when passing a custom timetable. Following the example in the tutorial -  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/timetable.html and running the following commands will result in an error - `ValueError: Not a valid timetable: <workday.AfterWorkdayTimetable object at 0x7f50f9cd1700>`\r\n\r\n1. airflow dags backfill <dag_id> -s <date> -e <date> --dry-run (works fine without --dry-run)\r\n2. airflow dags test <dag_id> [date]\r\n3. airflow tasks render <dag_id> <task_id> <date> (works fine if you pass a valid run_id instead of an execution_date)\r\n\r\nThe failure is due to missing `data_interval` when creating the `DagRun` object. The PR aims at adding `data_interval` when we are creating `DagRun`.\r\n\r\n- [X] Add `data_interval` for CLI commands\r\n- [X] Unit tests need to be added \r\ncloses:

`start-airflow` command uses fork to start parallell asset compilation in the background so that it can happen while docker compose initializes. Unfortunately this fork child did not have sys.exit() so it returned from the function and continued to run second docker-compose in the background. In case asset compilation was not needed this could happen in parallel and both processes attempted to start two docker-compose commands in parallel.\r\n\r\nThis was not visible in \"dev\" mode - because asset compilation never completed there also - when asset compilation was needed, it took some time before it completed, and the effect of it were not visible, because the forked process did not get terminal output (it has been taken over by tmux by the time it started to use it) and could not grab forwarded ports, so it was running but largely invisible.\r\n\r\nHowever when asset compilation was not needed, the two processes started to do the same things at the same time - so a lot of the output has been duplicated and for example the line output has been broken because the same messages were overwriting over each other and canceling the effect of EOL printed to terminal.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the forked process exits as soon as the asset compilation is completed and does not repeat the same steps that the parent process is doiing.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

paragraph was supposed to clarify things but it makes it confusing - it attempted to explain the difference vs \"default\" and supported versions of Python, referring to CI. Unfortunately this relation changes over time especially in transition phase like we are now where some CI runs on 3.7 (in v2-6-test branch) but some CI runs on 3.8 (in main branch).\r\n\r\nRemoval of the paragraph does not change anything, it actually makes the whole chapter consistent and previous paragraph already explains the rules.\r\n\r\nI believe we should remove it.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

change updates the security model of Airflow to better explain what are the capabilities of various kinds of users in Airflow deployments and give both users and security researchers a way to understand what security measures they can take and whether they can qualify potential security issues in Airflow properly - taking into account that various users of Airflow have various capabilities and behaviours considered by some of the users as security vulnerabilities, are standard capabilities of the users.\r\n\r\nIt also splits the security information of ours in two separate pages:\r\n\r\n* .github/SECURITY.md where we explain how to report the issues to Apache Airflow security team by the researchers\r\n\r\n* documentation security/index.html which is available via Airflow Website where we explain what our security model is and the different kinds of users we have.\r\n\r\nBoth serve slightly different purpose and both contain cross-reference links to each other in order to be able to redirect people who read about the security model to find out how they can report the issues but also to guide security researchers who want to assess whether their findings are real vulnerabilities, or rather normal behaviours following the Airflow Security model.\r\n\r\nSecurity has been also moved to be a top level topic, so that it is easier to find and navigate to. Old links have been redirected to the new locations.\r\n\r\nAlso chapters were added explaining Airflow vs. Providers security releases, what is the relation between Airflow and Providers security issues and how users should treat security announcements in providers.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#32091\r\n\r\nUpdates to triggerer job to improve robustness.\r\n\r\nContext:\r\nTriggerer runs two threads, one synchronous and one asynchronous. The synchronous thread handles db updates, and the asynchronous thread handles custom trigger code. The heartbeat update for the job happens in the synchronous thread.\r\n\r\nDetails (two updates):\r\n1. Added a check for missing associated task_instance when adding a trigger. This prevents a crash in the triggerer async thread when updating with partially updated data. The trigger concerned is ignored, and will later deleted by Trigger.clean_unused() in the synchronous thread.\r\n\r\n2. Added a check that the async thread is still running before updating triggerer heartbeat. This results in the triggerer being reported as unhealthy (and subsequently restarted) when the async thread crashes.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

forward-credentials flag was supposed to be disabled when you run start-airflow and shell commands. However the flag boolean value has been casted to str so False became \"False\" and forward-credentials for these two commaands have been enabled by default no matter if the flag was used. In effect for example .docker configuration and credentials have been forwarded to inside the docker container via `.docker` folder mapped, and in case you had some credentials helper or plugin configured there, it was also set for docker configuration.\r\n\r\nUsing the boolean value fixes the problem. Now you shoudl specify the --forward-credentials flag explicitly to forward credentials.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

\r\n* provides a oneline syntax for setting setup / teardown deps\r\n* makes it easy to convert dags to use feature\r\n* provides a mechanism to combine \"reusable\" taskflow tasks with setup / teardown\r\n* set setup and teardown in the same place you set deps\r\n\r\nThis provides a number of benefits.\r\n\r\nOne is now we can do MyTeardown(...).as_teardown(the_setup) instead of having to arrow directly these two.\r\n\r\nThe other is that I think it can be cognitively easier to set these properties while setting relationships rather than when instantiating.\r\n\r\nThis can also make it easier to \"convert\" an existing dag to use setup / teardown.  For example, take a look at [this system test dag](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_dms.py#L407-L429).  Imagine converting that to use setup / teardown.  If you need to set setup / teardown at instantiation, you are doing it far away from where you are actually setting the relationships between the tasks.  But I think sometimes it makes a lot of sense to set those properties at the same time as you set those relationships.  The present PR doesn't force user to do this, but it makes it possible.\r\n\r\nFinally, this *also* makes it possible to define reusable, parameterized tasks in taskflow, and use them as setups / teardowns / work tasks depending on context.  If we force you to set it at decorator level, then you must pick and we don't provide an official mechanism to override.\r\n\r\nExample of how this can make authoring a bit cleaner. I give two ways supported with the new approach, and for comparison i include the old way you had to do it.\r\n\r\nNew way 1:\r\n```python\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"example_setup_teardown\",\r\n    start_date=pendulum.datetime(2021, 1, 1, tz=\"UTC\"),\r\n) as dag:\r\n    s1 = BashOperator(task_id=\"setup\", bash_command=\"echo 'Hello from setup'\")\r\n    w1 = BashOperator(task_id=\"normal\", bash_command=\"echo 'I am just a normal task'\")\r\n    t1 = BashOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"teardown\", bash_command=\"echo 'Goodbye from teardown'\"\r\n    )\r\n    s1.as_setup() >> w1 >> t1.as_teardown(s1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nnew way 2:\r\n```python\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"example_setup_teardown\",\r\n    start_date=pendulum.datetime(2021, 1, 1, tz=\"UTC\"),\r\n) as dag:\r\n    s1 = BashOperator(task_id=\"setup\", bash_command=\"echo 'Hello from setup'\").as_setup()\r\n    w1 = BashOperator(task_id=\"normal\", bash_command=\"echo 'I am just a normal task'\")\r\n    t1 = BashOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"teardown\", bash_command=\"echo 'Goodbye from teardown'\"\r\n    ).as_teardown(s1)\r\n    s1 >> w1 >> t1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nOld way:\r\n```python\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"example_setup_teardown\",\r\n    start_date=pendulum.datetime(2021, 1, 1, tz=\"UTC\"),\r\n) as dag:\r\n    s1 = BashOperator.as_setup(task_id=\"setup\", bash_command=\"echo 'Hello from setup'\")\r\n    w1 = BashOperator(task_id=\"normal\", bash_command=\"echo 'I am just a normal task'\")\r\n    t1 = BashOperator.as_teardown(\r\n        task_id=\"teardown\", bash_command=\"echo

this PR, the test connection functionality will be disabled\r\nby default across Airflow UI, API and CLI. The availability of the \r\nfunctionality can be controlled by the `test_connection` flag in \r\nthe `core` section of the Airflow configuration (`airflow.cfg`). \r\nIt can also be controlled by the environment variable \r\n`AIRFLOW__CORE__TEST_CONNECTION`.\r\n\r\nThe following values are accepted for this config param:\r\n1. `Disabled`: Disables the test connection functionality and \r\ndisables(greys out) the Test Connection button in the UI.\r\nThis is also the default value set in the Airflow configuration.\r\n2. `Enabled`: Enables the test connection functionality and \r\nactivates the Test Connection button in the UI.\r\n3. `Hidden`: Disables the test connection functionality and \r\nhides the Test Connection button in UI.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

currently deploy and operate 2 Airflow cluster (prod & beta) connected with separate branch(like `prod`, and `beta`) via git-sync.\r\n\r\nBut, we had some difficulty when we needed to sync two separate branches(`prod` and `beta`) periodically with proper branching strategy\r\n- cherry-pick is too cumbersome to maintain repo.\r\n- hard-reset is not recommended solution for GitOps\r\n\r\nSo, we decided to connect two Airflow deployments to same branch(like `main`). But, if needed, we have to activate specific DAG on specific airflow deployment only, based on the DAG tag!\r\n\r\nI found `is_active` prop on `DagModel` ORM object. but I think it's not efficient to set this prop on the `dag_policy`, due to metadb overhead per parsing DAG.\r\n\r\nHow about introducing `AirflowClusterPolicySkipDag` exception, and using it for skipping dag without showing import error message on Web UI (=without recording it on `import_error` table)?\r\n\r\nexample)\r\n```\r\ndef dag_policy(dag: DAG):\r\n    if \"only_for_beta\" in dag.tags:\r\n        raise AirflowClusterPolicySkipDag(\"`only_for_beta` tag is detected\")\r\n``` \r\n\r\nIt's just making a back-door for another MR (I previously committed) below.\r\n\r\nrelated:

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/28865\r\nThe DAG test command stuck in infinite loop when DAG is paused\r\n1. task resume from deferable state: TI change from deferrable to scheduled\r\n2. task has retry and task fail and up for retry: TI change from running to up_for_retry\r\n\r\nBecause the current implementation call [_run_task](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/models/dag.py#L3851) and assume the task will either fail or succeed but in case of deferrable when TI resumes again (from the trigger) and we need to run check callback that has been passed in custom trigger while initializing and deferring. \r\n\r\nIn this PR I'm storing try number for TI's to handle the retries and when handling running trigger callback in a separate loop to handle the deferrable operator.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

the exception that triggerer initialization failed\r\n\r\n## What's the issue\r\nWhen we migrate from an older provider to a newer version with an argument removed from the trigger, it results in the following exception that causes the triggerer to fail.\r\n\r\n```text\r\nTypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument '.....'\r\n```\r\n\r\nfrom

the exception and set the old task to failed\r\n\r\n## How to reproduce\r\n\r\n### Step 1\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/airflow.git\r\n\r\ncd airflow\r\n\r\n# The latest main branch when I reproduced this issue\r\ngit checkout d2c038e0437a23ce1f41960ce6e27216d9f9e579\r\n\r\ncp airflow/example_dags/example_time_delta_sensor_async.py files/dags\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 2\r\n\r\nAdd a new argument to `airflow/triggers/temporal.py` like the following\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>airflow/triggers/temporal.py</summary>\r\n\r\n```python\r\n......\r\nclass

3\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nbreeze --python 3.9 --backend sqlite start-airflow --db-reset\r\n```\r\n\r\nGo to the web UI and run DAG \"example_time_delta_sensor_async\"\r\n\r\nEnsure the task goes into the `DEFERRED` state without finishing\r\n\r\nGo back to the terminal and run command `stop_airflow`\r\n\r\n### Step 4\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# make sure the changes on airflow/triggers/temporal.py are reverted\r\ngit checkout .\r\ngit checkout d2c038e0437a23ce1f41960ce6e27216d9f9e579\r\n\r\nbreeze --python 3.9 --backend sqlite start-airflow --db-reset\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 5\r\n\r\nCheck the log

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\nCurrently if the trigger yield multiple events, we load them all in a queue, and we pass through them multiple times but we use only the first one:\r\nIn this block we pass through all the events to get the trigger ids, and we add them to a set, and since they have the same trigger id, we don't need them all in this block:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/fc0e5a4d42ee882ca5bc20ea65be38b2c739644d/airflow/jobs/triggerer_job_runner.py#L658-L663\r\n\r\nThen we handle them using this method:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/fc0e5a4d42ee882ca5bc20ea65be38b2c739644d/airflow/jobs/triggerer_job_runner.py#L378-L389\r\n\r\nBut if we check the method `Trigger.submit_event`, we found that we filter on `TaskInstance.state` which we update to `scheduled` when we handle the first event, so the next sql queries are useless and will always return an empty list:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/0f1cef27a5a19dd56e6b07ab0bf9868fb850421a/airflow/models/trigger.py#L142-L160\r\n\r\nAnd if we check the result of the tests I added in #31985, we found that it's possible to have a lot of generated events from the same trigger, so we can avoid increasing the memory size and reduce the SQL queries by just loading the first event.\r\n\r\nIf there is a need to process all the generated events (which is not the case now), we need to change our handling method to wait the task termination and we need to provide all these events to the method `execute_complete` as a list which is a breaking change, but for now, the best solution is just loading the first event.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\nrelated: #31703\r\n\r\nIn #31703, we decided to remove certain return statements under the assumption that they were unnecessary after yielding an event. However, upon testing this strategy, it appears that in certain cases (specifically when the triggerer service is overloaded), we end up generating a significant number of events. As a result, we continue with unnecessary processing, which further burdens the triggerer.\r\n\r\nTo test that, I have created a new module `airflow/tests.py`:\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import annotations\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.models import BaseOperator\r\nfrom airflow.triggers.base import BaseTrigger, TriggerEvent\r\n\r\n\r\nclass TestTrigger(BaseTrigger):\r\n    def serialize(self) -> tuple[str, dict]:\r\n        return (\"airflow.tests.TestTrigger\", {} )\r\n\r\n    async def run(self):\r\n        ind = 0\r\n        while True:\r\n            yield TriggerEvent(\r\n                {\r\n                    \"message\": f\"Hello, world!

providers are excluded for some versions of Python (for example the `apache.hive` provider is excluded on Python 3.11. However this might make some pre-commits confused when running on Python 3.11 because the list of generated extras will be different for them than those on other Python versions.\r\n\r\nWe do not want to set python used in pre-commits to, say, python3.8, because that would mean that would require our users to have python3.8 as binary available on their system, which is not always setup. Python3 on the other hand is going to be universally available.\r\n\r\nIn order to mitigate the problem we will run the precommits with _SKIP_PYTHON_VERSION_CHECK variable set before import of setup is done, so that the python version check is skipped and all python versions will produce the same set of extras.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

`EksCreateClusterOperator` is capable of creating a Fargate Profile or Nodegroup that is associated with the newly created cluster. The code for creating the Fargate Profile and Nodegroup is the same as the code in `EksCreateFargateProfileOperator` and `EksCreateNodegroupOperator` respectively. \r\nThis PR refactors the code to reuse some of the code to decrease code duplication.

PR tries to fix a problem that I had some weeks ago. If you are storing your logs locally, and since the logs folders tree structure by default follows the pattern <dag_id>/<run_id>/<task_id>/<attempt_id>.log this scales quickly. \r\n\r\nAfter some time you got thousands of empty folders and the clean-logs.sh starts to consume a lot of memory due to the find command.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/74016165/cb60951c-e210-4fd8-8024-330a4ce58286)\r\n\r\nWhere you can find an example of what was happening in our case. Work-log-groomer containers were consuming 6-7 GB of memory on average just to clean logs. 🤯\r\n\r\nWith this small change, I added a flag that allows us to delete not only the file but also all the folders, once it doesn't make sense to save empty folders.\r\n\r\nIn the screenshot below you can find the real impact of this change:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/74016165/44213f0a-7d4c-48c5-9a87-9bd322b9cf95)\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-16T09:25:12Z","updated_at":"2023-08-18T21:44:10Z","closed_at":"2023-08-18T21:44:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9e0fc216d85033d58212a10eb64777f838912820","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale
