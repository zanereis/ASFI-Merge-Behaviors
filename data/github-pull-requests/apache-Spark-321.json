What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI made two improvements as follows, we can have broader usage on\r\nshortest paths.\r\n(1) Output multiple shortest paths if there are. It computes shortest\r\npaths from a given source vertex to all other vertices. If several\r\npaths have the same shortest distance between two vertices, all the\r\npaths will be outputted.\r\n(2) Support both weighted and unweighted graphs. The generalized\r\nproblem is weighted graph, and it is what my code works on.  You just\r\nneed to input the weighted graph as ’true’ in the parameters. It can\r\nalso address the unweighted graph. If you input an unweighted graph, I\r\njust set the weights of each edge as 1.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2017-05-01T21:29:18Z","updated_at":"2020-01-03T17:35:47Z","closed_at":"2020-01-03T17:35:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"63c5e647557fcda9239bc0ef6bb1178cc889605f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406607243,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA3MjQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/GRAPHX","name":"GRAPHX","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17822/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17822/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17822/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/401391c703464efffc5c730fb775a18c061fc5c3","head":{"label":"daijidj:master","ref":"master","sha":"401391c703464efffc5c730fb775a18c061fc5c3","user":{"login":"daijidj","id":7347517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNDc1MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7347517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj","html_url":"https://github.com/daijidj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":89654495,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4OTY1NDQ5NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"daijidj/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"daijidj","id":7347517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNDc1MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7347517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj","html_url":"https://github.com/daijidj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daijidj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/daijidj/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the current codes, when worker connects to master, master will send its address to the worker. Then worker will save this address and use it to reconnect in case of failure. However, sometimes, this address is not correct. If there is a proxy between master and worker, the address master sent is not the address of proxy.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the master address used by the worker will be sent to the master, then master just replies this address back, worker will use this address to reconnect in case of failure. In other words, the worker will use the config master address set in the worker side if possible rather than the master address set in the master side.\r\n\r\nThere is still one potential issue though. When a master is restarted or takes over leadership, the work will use the address sent from the master to connect. If there is still a proxy between  master and worker, the address may be wrong. However, there is no way to figure it out just in the worker.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe new added unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrent ML's Bucketizer can only bin a column of continuous features. If a dataset has thousands of of continuous columns needed to bin, we will result in thousands of ML stages. It is inefficient regarding query planning and execution.\r\n\r\nWe should have a type of bucketizer that can bin a lot of columns all at once. It would need to accept an list of arrays of split points to correspond to the columns to bin, but it might make things more efficient by replacing thousands of stages with just one.\r\n\r\nThis current approach in this patch is to add a new `MultipleBucketizerInterface` for this purpose. `Bucketizer` now extends this new interface.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nBenchmarking using the test dataset provided in JIRA SPARK-20392 (blockbuster.csv).\r\n\r\nThe ML pipeline includes 2 `StringIndexer`s and 1 `MultipleBucketizer` or 137 `Bucketizer`s to bin 137 input columns with the same splits. Then count the time to transform the dataset.\r\n\r\nMultipleBucketizer: 3352 ms\r\nBucketizer: 51512 ms\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review

are two problems fixed in this commit. First, the\r\nExecutorAllocationManager sets a timeout to avoid requesting executors\r\ntoo often. However, the timeout is always updated based on its value and\r\na timeout, not the current time. If the call is delayed by locking for\r\nmore than the ongoing scheduler timeout, the manager will request more\r\nexecutors on every run. This seems to be the main cause of SPARK-20540.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is that the total number of requested executors is\r\nnot tracked by the CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend. Instead, it calculates\r\nthe value based on the current status of 3 variables: the number of\r\nknown executors, the number of executors that have been killed, and the\r\nnumber of pending executors. But, the number of pending executors is\r\nnever less than 0, even though there may be more known than requested.\r\nWhen executors are killed and not replaced, this can cause the request\r\nsent to YARN to be incorrect because there were too many executors due\r\nto the scheduler's state being slightly out of date. This is fixed by tracking\r\nthe currently requested size explicitly.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-30T22:36:13Z","updated_at":"2017-10-25T18:04:38Z","closed_at":"2017-05-01T21:51:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b55f01f46953813d54f53aae7195cdd9668cc92f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17813/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17813/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17813/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3e46f4f8448f0b7cde8dfa2f6ee42b61fd8adcd6","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-20540-fix-dynamic-allocation","ref":"SPARK-20540-fix-dynamic-allocation","sha":"3e46f4f8448f0b7cde8dfa2f6ee42b61fd8adcd6","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRight now any Dataset/DataFrame batch query with the operation `withWatermark` does not execute because the batch planner does not have any rule to explicitly handle the `EventTimeWatermark` logical plan.\r\n\r\nThe right solution is to simply remove the plan node, as the watermark should not affect any batch query in any way.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, our project needs to be set to clean up the worker directory cleanup cycle is three days. \r\nWhen I follow http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html, configure the 'spark.worker.cleanup.appDataTtl' parameter, I configured to 3 * 24 * 3600.\r\nWhen I start the spark service, the startup fails, and the worker log displays the error log as follows:\r\n\r\n2017-04-28 15:02:03,306 INFO Utils: Successfully started service 'sparkWorker' on port 48728.\r\nException in thread \"main\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nReading from a Hive ORC table containing char/varchar columns fails in Spark SQL. This is caused by the fact that Spark SQL internally replaces the char/varchar columns with String data type. So, while reading from the table created in Hive which has varchar/char columns, it ends up using the wrong reader and causes a ClassCastException.\r\n\r\nThis patch allows Spark SQL to interpret varchar/char columns correctly, and store them as varchar/char type instead of internally converting to string columns.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n-> Added Unit tests\r\n-> Manually tested on AWS EMR cluster\r\n\r\nStep 1:\r\nCreated a table using hive (having varchar/char columns), and inserted some data:\r\n\r\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hive_orc_test (\r\na VARCHAR(10),\r\nb CHAR(10),\r\nc BIGINT)\r\nSTORED AS ORC\r\nLOCATION 's3://xxxx';\r\n\r\nINSERT INTO TABLE hive_orc_test VALUES ('abc', 'A', 101), ('abc1', 'B', 102), ('abc3', 'C', 103);\r\n\r\nStep 2:\r\nCreated an external table in Spark SQL using the same source location, and run a select query on that.\r\n\r\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS spark_orc_test (\r\na VARCHAR(10),\r\nb CHAR(10),\r\nc BIGINT)\r\nSTORED AS ORC\r\nLOCATION 's3://xxxx';\r\n\r\nSELECT * form spark_orc_test;\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n17/02/24 23:22:57 INFO DAGScheduler: Job 1 finished: processCmd at

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt seems we are using `SQLUtils.getSQLDataType` for type string in structField. It looks we can replace this with `CatalystSqlParser.parseDataType`.\r\n\r\nThey look similar DDL-like type definitions as below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> Seq(Tuple1(Tuple1(\"a\"))).toDF.show()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n+---+\r\n| _1|\r\n+---+\r\n|[a]|\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> Seq(Tuple1(Tuple1(\"a\"))).toDF.select($\"_1\".cast(\"struct<_1:string>\")).show()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n+---+\r\n| _1|\r\n+---+\r\n|[a]|\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuch type strings looks identical when R’s one as below:\r\n\r\n```R\r\n> write.df(sql(\"SELECT named_struct('_1', 'a') as struct\"), \"/tmp/aa\", \"parquet\")\r\n> collect(read.df(\"/tmp/aa\", \"parquet\", structType(structField(\"struct\", \"struct<_1:string>\"))))\r\n  struct\r\n1      a\r\n```\r\n\r\nR’s one is stricter because we are checking the types via regular expressions in R side ahead.\r\n\r\nActual logics there look a bit different but as we check it ahead in R side, it looks replacing it would not introduce (I think) no behaviour changes. To make this sure, the tests dedicated for it were added in SPARK-20105. (It looks `structField` is the only place that calls this method).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests - https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/R/pkg/inst/tests/testthat/test_sparkSQL.R#L143-L194 should cover

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently credentials file configuration is recovered from checkpoint file when Spark Streaming applicatioin is restarted, which will lead to some unwanted behaviors, for example:\r\n\r\n1. Submit Spark Streaming application using keytab file with checkpoint enabled in yarn-cluster mode.\r\n\r\n> spark-submit --master yarn-cluster --principal xxxx --keytab xxx ...\r\n\r\n2. Stop Spark Streaming application;\r\n3. Resubmit this application after a period of time (i.e. one day);\r\n4. Credentials file configuration recover from checkpoint file, so value of  \"spark.yarn.credentials.file\" points to old staging directory (i.e. hdfs://xxxx/.sparkStaging/application_xxxx/credentials-xxxx, application_xxxx is the application id of the previous application which was stopped.)\r\n4. When launching executor, ExecutorDelegationTokenUpdater will update credentials from credentials file immediately. As credentials file was generated one day ago (maybe older), it has already expired, so after a period of time the executor keeps failing.\r\n\r\nSome useful logs are shown below :\r\n\r\n>2017-04-27,15:08:08,098 INFO org.apache.spark.executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend: Will periodically update credentials from:

Number of column name and column type differs. columnNames = [a, , b], columnTypes = [string, string]\r\n```\r\nIt has a bug in Hive metastore. \r\n\r\nWhen users do not provide alias name in the SELECT query, we call `toPrettySQL` to generate the alias name. For example, the string `get_json_object(jstring, '$.f1')` will be the alias name for the function call in the statement \r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT key, get_json_object(jstring, '$.f1') FROM tempView\r\n``` \r\nAbove is not an issue for the SELECT query statements. However, for CTAS, we hit the issue due to a bug in Hive metastore. Hive metastore does not like the column names containing commas and returned a confusing error message, like:\r\n```\r\n17/04/26 23:12:56 ERROR [hive.log(397) -- main]: error in initSerDe: org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.SerDeException org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe: columns has 2 elements while columns.types has 1

to block users to create a table in Hive metastore when the table table has a column containing commas in the name. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRelax the requirement that a `TimeZoneAwareExpression` has to have its `timeZoneId` set to be considered resolved.\r\nWith this change, a `Cast` (which is a `TimeZoneAwareExpression`) can be considered resolved if the `(fromType, toType)` combination doesn't require time zone information.\r\n\r\nAlso de-relaxed test cases in `CastSuite` so Casts in that test suite don't get a default`timeZoneId = Option(\"GMT\")`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan the de-relaxed`CastSuite` and it's passing. Also ran the SQL unit tests and they're passing too.","created_at":"2017-04-26T23:10:19Z","updated_at":"2017-04-27T19:32:05Z","closed_at":"2017-04-27T19:10:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2bde138bcb9d9ce083ae97318b6377fdfb3fc6ea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17777/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17777/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17777/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/161b78082ea04ab87ab26ff2409cb459bf7076f2","head":{"label":"rednaxelafx:fix-catalyst-cast-timezone","ref":"fix-catalyst-cast-timezone","sha":"161b78082ea04ab87ab26ff2409cb459bf7076f2","user":{"login":"rednaxelafx","id":107834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx","html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":89513466,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4OTUxMzQ2Ng==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"rednaxelafx/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rednaxelafx","id":107834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx","html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n```SQL\r\nhive> create table t1(`a,` string);\r\nOK\r\nTime taken: 1.399 seconds\r\n\r\nhive> create table t2(`a,` string, b string);\r\nFAILED: Execution Error, return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.DDLTask. java.lang.RuntimeException: MetaException(message:org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.SerDeException org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe: columns has 3 elements while columns.types has 2 elements!)\r\n\r\nhive> create table t2(`a,` string, b string) stored as parquet;\r\nFAILED: Execution Error, return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.DDLTask. java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: ParquetHiveSerde initialization failed. Number of column name and column type differs. columnNames = [a, , b], columnTypes = [string, string]\r\n```\r\nIt has a bug in Hive metastore. \r\n\r\nWhen users do not provide alias name in the SELECT query, we call `toPrettySQL` to generate the alias name. \r\n\r\nFor example, \r\nthe string `get_json_object(jstring, '$.f1')` will be the alias name for the function call in the statement \r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT key, get_json_object(jstring, '$.f1') FROM tempView\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAbove is not an issue for the SELECT query statements. However, for CTAS, we hit the issue due to a bug in Hive metastore. Hive metastore does not like the column names containing commas and returned a confusing error message, like:\r\n```\r\n17/04/26 23:12:56 ERROR [hive.log(397) -- main]: error in initSerDe: org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.SerDeException org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe: columns has 2 elements while columns.types has 1 elements!\r\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.SerDeException: org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe: columns has 2 elements while columns.types has 1 elements!\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus, this PR is to exclude the comma from the alias name generated by our Spark SQL so that Spark SQL users can do CTAS on the query containing a function call with commas but without user-given alias names. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOmit rounding of backpressure rate. Effects:\r\n- no batch with large number of records is created when rate from PID estimator is one\r\n- the number of records per batch and partition is more fine-grained improving backpressure accuracy\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis was tested by running:\r\n- `mvn test -pl external/kafka-0-8`\r\n- `mvn test -pl external/kafka-0-10`\r\n- a streaming application which was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt is reported that there is performance downgrade when applying ML pipeline for dataset with many columns but few rows.\r\n\r\nA big part of the performance downgrade comes from some operations (e.g., `select`) on DataFrame/Dataset which re-create new DataFrame/Dataset with a new `LogicalPlan`. The cost can be ignored in the usage of SQL, normally.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's not rare to chain dozens of pipeline stages in ML. When the query plan grows incrementally during running those stages, the total cost spent on re-creation of DataFrame grows too. In particular, the `Analyzer` will go through the big query plan even most part of it is analyzed.\r\n\r\nBy eliminating part of the cost, the time to run the example code locally is reduced from about 1min to about 30 secs.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the time applying the pipeline locally is mostly spent on calling transform of the 137 `Bucketizer`s. Before the change, each call of `Bucketizer`'s transform can cost about 0.4 sec. So the total time spent on all `Bucketizer`s' transform is about 50 secs. After the change, each call only costs about 0.1 sec.\r\n\r\n<del>We also make `boundEnc` as lazy variable to reduce unnecessary running time.</del>\r\n\r\n### Performance improvement\r\n\r\nThe codes and datasets provided by Barry Becker to re-produce this issue and benchmark can be found on the JIRA.\r\n\r\nBefore this patch: about 1 min\r\nAfter this patch: about 20 secs\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-26T09:03:26Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:20:43Z","closed_at":"2017-05-26T05:48:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6cda6a9b54ee4760e2e3b7437abfbf07667ac8e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17770/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17770/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17770/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6add9ec4aad2266f08fb77ad137442fa00552560","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-20392","ref":"SPARK-20392","sha":"6add9ec4aad2266f08fb77ad137442fa00552560","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a non-feature-changing refactoring of the ALS code (specifically, the `org.apache.spark.ml.recommendation` package), done to improve code maintainability and to add significant documentation to the existing code.  My motivation for this PR is that I've been working on an online streaming ALS implementation [[SPARK-6407](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-6407)] (PR coming soon), and I've been refactoring the package to help me understand the existing code before adding to it.  I've also tried my best to include a fair bit of Scaladocs and inline comments where I felt they would have helped when I was reading the code.\r\n\r\nI've done a fair bit of rebasing and sausage making to make the commits easy to follow, since no one likes to stare at a 2,700-line PR.  Please let me know if I can make anything clearer.  I'd be happy to answer any questions.\r\n\r\nIn a few places, you'll find a `PLEASE_ADVISE(danielyli):` tag in the code.  These are questions I had in the course of the refactoring.  I'd appreciate if the relevant folks could help me with these.  Thanks.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAs this is a non-feature-changing refactoring, existing tests were used.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes Executor's threads to `UninterruptibleThread` so that we can use `runUninterruptibly` in `CachedKafkaConsumer`. However, this is just best effort to avoid hanging forever. If the user uses`CachedKafkaConsumer` in another thread (e.g., create a new thread or Future), the potential hang may still happen.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe new added

SHS (Spark History Server) has two different ACLs:\r\n\r\n* ACL of base URL, it is controlled by \"spark.acls.enabled\" or \"spark.ui.acls.enabled\", and with this enabled, only user configured with \"spark.admin.acls\" (or group) or \"spark.ui.view.acls\" (or group), or the user who started SHS could list all the applications, otherwise none of them can be listed. This will also affect REST APIs which listing the summary of all apps and one app.\r\n* Per application ACL. This is controlled by \"spark.history.ui.acls.enabled\". With this enabled only history admin user and user/group who ran this app can access the details of this app.\r\n\r\nWith this two ACLs, we may encounter several unexpected behaviors:\r\n\r\n1. if base URL's ACL (`spark.acls.enable`) is enabled but user A has no view permission. User \"A\" cannot see the app list but could still access details of it's own app.\r\n2. if ACLs of base URL (`spark.acls.enable`) is disabled, then user \"A\" could download any application's event log, even it is not run by user \"A\".\r\n3. The changes of Live UI's ACL will affect History UI's ACL which share the same conf file.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected behaviors is mainly because we have two different ACLs, ideally we should have only one to manage all.\r\n\r\nSo to improve SHS's ACL mechanism, here in this PR proposed to:\r\n\r\n1. Disable \"spark.acls.enable\" and only use \"spark.history.ui.acls.enable\" for history server.\r\n2. Check permission for event-log download REST API.\r\n\r\nWith this PR:\r\n\r\n1. Admin user could see/download the list of all applications, as well as application details.\r\n2. Normal user could see the list of all applications, but can only download and check the details of applications accessible to him.\r\n\r\nNew UTs are added, also verified in real cluster.\r\n\r\nCC tgravescs vanzin please help to review, this PR changes the semantics you did previously. Thanks a lot.","created_at":"2017-04-25T02:36:25Z","updated_at":"2017-04-26T00:32:14Z","closed_at":"2017-04-26T00:32:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bf2e159e31c93db63c50d22a6813ffbba85721f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17755/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17755/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17755/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2fc1525c4e0f55a684bc894403694fcfac8f878e","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-20239-2.1-backport","ref":"SPARK-20239-2.1-backport","sha":"2fc1525c4e0f55a684bc894403694fcfac8f878e","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `randomSplit`, It is possible that the underlying dataset doesn't guarantee the ordering of rows in its constituent partitions each time a split is materialized which could result in overlapping \r\nsplits.\r\n\r\nTo prevent this, as part of SPARK-12662, we explicitly sort each input partition to make the ordering deterministic. Given that `MapTypes` cannot be sorted this patch explicitly prunes them out from the sort order. Additionally, if the resulting sort order is empty, this patch then materializes the dataset to guarantee determinism.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExtended `randomSplit on reordered partitions` in `DataFrameStatSuite` to also test for dataframes with mapTypes nested mapTypes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19611 fixes a regression from 2.0 where Spark silently fails to read case-sensitive fields missing a case-sensitive schema in the table properties. The fix is to detect this situation, infer the schema, and write the case-sensitive schema into the metastore.\r\n\r\nHowever this can incur an unexpected performance hit the first time such a problematic table is queried (and there is a high false-positive rate here since most tables don't actually have case-sensitive fields).\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the default to NEVER_INFER (same behavior as 2.1.0). In 2.2, we can consider leaving the default to INFER_AND_SAVE.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds metrics to the history server, with the `FsHistoryProvider` metering its operation count and time spent in activities.\r\n\r\nThe `HistoryServer` sets up the codahale metrics for the Web under metrics/ with metrics/metrics behind metrics, metrics/health any health probes and metrics/threads a thread dump. There's currently no attempt to  hook up JMX, etc. The Web servlets are the ones tests can easily hit and don't need infrastructure, so are the good initial first step.\r\n\r\nIt then instantiated the configured `ApplicationHistoryProvider` implementation, now invoking the `start(): Option[Source]` method. If this method\r\nreturns an instance of `org.apache.spark.metrics.source.Source`, then it will \r\n\r\n```\r\n  def start(): Option[Source] = {\r\n    None\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nPart of the patch for `HistoryServerSuite` removes the call to `HistoryServer.initialize()` in the `before` clause. That was a duplicate call, one which hit the re-entrancy tests on the provider and registry. As well as cutting it, `HistoryServer.initialize()` has been made idempotent. That should not be needed -but it will eliminate the problem arising again.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- New test suite `HistoryMetricSourceSuite` to verify low level metrics, in particular ability to wire up a lambda expression to a Coda Hale probe.\r\n- The test suite `FsHistoryProviderSuite` queries the FsHistoryProvider metrics within the existing tests, alongside the existing probes of the `ApplicationCache` metrics. this not only adds coverage of the metrics, it allows the metrics to be used within assertions on the behaviour of the History provider.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-24T16:00:30Z","updated_at":"2017-09-21T10:40:05Z","closed_at":"2017-09-21T10:40:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"959aecee8d9fd8a1136e8b8eeb0955572ae1c977","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17747/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17747/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17747/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0d6f85e9f1df41ab9e7df518b814ea3da9cd6274","head":{"label":"steveloughran:history/SPARK-11373-minimal-hs-metrics","ref":"history/SPARK-11373-minimal-hs-metrics","sha":"0d6f85e9f1df41ab9e7df518b814ea3da9cd6274","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32387210,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM4NzIxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"steveloughran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChanges to `FileInputDStream` to eliminate multiple `getFileStatus()` calls when scanning directories for new files.\r\n\r\nThis is a minor optimisation when working with filesystems, but significant when working with object stores, as it eliminates HTTP requests per source file scanning the system. The current cost is 1-3 probing to see if a path is a directory or not, one more to actually timestamp a file. The new patch gets the file status and retains it through all the operations, so does not need to re-evaluate it. \r\n\r\nThe impact of this optimisation is 3 HTTP requests per source directory and 1 per file, for every single directory in the scan list, and for every file in the scanned directories, irrespective of the age of the directories. At 100+mS per HEAD request against S3, the speedup is significant, even when there are few files in the scanned directories.\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\n1. Two separate list operations, `globStatus()` to find directories, then `listStatus()` to scan for new files under directories.\r\n1.  The path filter in the `globStatus()` operations calls `getFileStatus(filename)` to probe for a file being a directory;\r\n1. `getFileStatus()` is also used in the `listStatus()` call to check the timestamp. \r\n\r\nAgainst an object store `getFileStatus()` can cost 1-4 HTTPS requests per call (HEAD path, HEAD path + \"/\", LIST path), \r\n\r\nAs both list operations return an array or iterator of `FileStatus` objects, the operations are utterly superfluous. Instead the filtering can take\r\nplace after the listing has returned.\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\n1. The output of `globStatus()` is filtered to select only directories.\r\n1. The output of `listStatus()` is filtered by timestamp.\r\n1. The special failure case of `globStatus()`: no path, is handled specially in the warning text by saying \"No Directory to scan\", and omitting the full stack trace.\r\n1. The `fileToModTime` map is superflous, and so deleted.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. There is a new test in `org.apache.spark.streaming.InputStreamsSuite`\r\n1. I have object store integration tests in an external repository, which have been used to verify functionality and that the number of HTTP requests is reduced when invoked against S3A endpoints.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-24T13:15:16Z","updated_at":"2018-09-03T13:41:15Z","closed_at":"2017-09-28T12:22:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"10a686d1044dc7ab68c349026b348e20ba41207c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17745/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17745/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17745/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f3ffe1db2e5edc9b6a60fb48b34b3099853e4324","head":{"label":"steveloughran:cloud/SPARK-17159-listfiles-minimal","ref":"cloud/SPARK-17159-listfiles-minimal","sha":"f3ffe1db2e5edc9b6a60fb48b34b3099853e4324","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32387210,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM4NzIxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"steveloughran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe recommendForAll of MLLIB ALS is very slow.\r\nGC is a key problem of the current method.\r\nThe task use the following code to keep temp result:\r\nval output = new Array[(Int, (Int, Double))](m*n)\r\nm = n = 4096 (default value, no method to set)\r\nso output is about 4k * 4k * (4 + 4 + 8) = 256M. This is a large memory and cause serious GC problem, and it is frequently OOM.\r\n\r\nActually, we don't need to save all the temp result. Support we recommend topK (topK is about 10, or 20) product for each user, we only need 4k * topK * (4 + 4 + 8) memory to save the temp result.\r\n\r\nThe Test Environment:\r\n3 workers: each work 10

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fill up the documentation with examples for `bitwiseOR`, `bitwiseAND`, `bitwiseXOR`. `contains`, `asc` and `desc` in `Column` API.\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR fixes minor typos in the documentation and matches some of the contents between Scala doc and Python doc.\r\n\r\nLastly, this PR suggests to use `spark` rather than `sc` in doc tests in `Column` for Python documentation.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nDoc tests were added and manually tested with the commands below:\r\n\r\n`./python/run-tests.py --module pyspark-sql`\r\n`./python/run-tests.py --module pyspark-sql --python-executable python3`\r\n`./dev/lint-python`\r\n\r\nOutput was checked via `make html` under `./python/docs`. The snapshots will be left on the codes with

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe new SQL parser is introduced into Spark 2.0. Seems it bring an issue regarding the regex pattern string.\r\n\r\nThe following codes can reproduce it:\r\n\r\n    val data = Seq(\"\\u0020\\u0021\\u0023\", \"abc\")\r\n    val df = data.toDF()\r\n\r\n    // 1st usage: works in 1.6\r\n    // Let parser parse pattern string\r\n    val rlike1 = df.filter(\"value rlike '^\\\\x20[\\\\x20-\\\\x23]+$'\")\r\n    // 2nd usage: works in 1.6, 2.x\r\n    // Call Column.rlike so the pattern string is a literal which doesn't go through parser\r\n    val rlike2 = df.filter($\"value\".rlike(\"^\\\\x20[\\\\x20-\\\\x23]+$\"))\r\n\r\n    // In 2.x, we need add backslashes to make regex pattern parsed correctly\r\n    val rlike3 = df.filter(\"value rlike '^\\\\\\\\x20[\\\\\\\\x20-\\\\\\\\x23]+$'\")\r\n\r\nDue to unescaping SQL String in parser, the first usage working in 1.6 can't work in 2.0. To make it work, we need to add additional backslashes.\r\n\r\nIt is quite weird that we can't use the same regex pattern string in the 2 usages. We should not do unescaping on regex pattern string.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-24T03:11:27Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:20:33Z","closed_at":"2017-05-07T05:12:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8416135a1fc255e2cb93b5dfb8e37efe4612b397","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17736/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17736/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17736/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f29578219d6eebc9913c359a360ff9eafcb513fc","head":{"label":"viirya:rlike-regex","ref":"rlike-regex","sha":"f29578219d6eebc9913c359a360ff9eafcb513fc","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWithin the same streaming query, when one `StreamingRelation` is referred multiple times – e.g. `df.union(df)` – we should transform it only to one `StreamingExecutionRelation`, instead of two or more different `StreamingExecutionRelation`s (each of which would have a separate set of source, source logs, ...).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch
