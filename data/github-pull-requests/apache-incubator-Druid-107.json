PR includes a new integration test that does hadoop indexing.\n\nI wanted to keep this new test separate from the existing tests, so that it wouldn't run with the \"mvn -P integration-tests\" command. That's because I thought it reasonable to expect that not all test environments would have access to hadoop (that's true of some our test environments). Also, the current setup of docker does not include hadoop access. I expect it's possible to add that, but I didn't want to do that as part of this PR.\n\nSo, I put the test into a new package \"hadoop\" so that it's easy to exclude it in testng.xml. Testng does not seem to provide a way to exclude classes or methods from included packages. I could have changed testng.xml to list the classes, but that would preclude adding an indexer or query test without  editing testng.xml.\n\nI decided to make configurable the location of the input data in hdfs, because (like for us) folks running the test might be constrained as to the location of space in hdfs that's available for their use.\n\nI made a couple of changes to make it possible to express that configured value when using docker, in anticipation of running the test that way someday.\n","created_at":"2016-03-14T15:56:44Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:35:45Z","closed_at":"2016-03-23T18:04:55Z","merged_at":"2016-03-23T18:04:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"8a473111c55090bd1242ea2d95b4b2b40a3ece84","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area

using druid 0.9.0-rc2 and my metadata database is on postgresql.\nI noticed a bunch of errors when starting the Overlord the second time, it couldn't create the (already existing) table

druid_pendingSegments (\n```\n\nI've started the Overlord myself and notice the query to test the existence doesn't work specifically for `druid_pendingSegments` because of the capital letter, PostgreSQL's \"lowercasing\" if names are not enclosed in double-quotes iirc.\n\nThus, I've updated the SQL query to be case insensitive.\n\n```\nSELECT tablename FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables WHERE

`((BatchUpdateException) e.getCause().getCause()).getNextException()` in `createTable` catch handler (I didn't added it in the logs, should I?).\n\nAnyway,\n\nThanks,\n","created_at":"2016-03-12T22:51:45Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:35:45Z","closed_at":"2016-03-14T20:57:53Z","merged_at":"2016-03-14T20:57:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"e6487294ccaa5c7c193e296ee4af8a079f41957b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/14","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/14","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/14/labels","id":1092727,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTA5MjcyNw==","number":14,"title":"0.9.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":393,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-05-01T16:53:57Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T00:30:50Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2016-05-20T00:30:50Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2648/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2648/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2648/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/416cb03687f3bc2872ae4ce8e66edd9d868e2992","head":{"label":"sderosiaux:master","ref":"master","sha":"416cb03687f3bc2872ae4ce8e66edd9d868e2992","user":{"login":"sderosiaux","id":3936459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzY0NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3936459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux","html_url":"https://github.com/sderosiaux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50997098,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDk5NzA5OA==","name":"druid","full_name":"sderosiaux/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sderosiaux","id":3936459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzY0NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3936459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux","html_url":"https://github.com/sderosiaux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sderosiaux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sderosiaux/druid","description":"Column

hack to know whether realtime index task is pending or ready(firehose is made). \n\nOur use case is such that a daemon process collecting data makes schema for it and submits realtime index task to overlord. And when the indexer is ready it pushes data to the indexer. The problem is that it's not possible to know the indexer is ready or not.\n\nThis patch acquires shareable-dummy-lock when the firehose is ready in indexer and that can be a signal for ready.

PR adds support for Long and Float numeric dimensions using a new dimension handling interface.\n\nIt depends on the following two PRs:\n\nhttps://github.com/druid-io/druid-api/pull/75\nhttps://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/2607\n\nImplementation notes:\n- At a high level, type-specific handling for dimensions in the IncrementalIndex, IndexMerger, and querying paths has been extracted into a new interface. There are 4 associated classes with the new interface:\n  - DimensionHandler: Top level class, provides comparators and used to create the other 3 classes\n  - DimensionIndexer: Handles logic related to in-memory ingestion of rows (IncrementalIndex)\n  - DimensionMerger: Handles logic related to merging of segments (IndexMerger)\n  - DimensionColumnReader: Handles logic related to reading from QueryableIndex/Columns \n- There are String/Long/Float implementations of these classes.\n- Dictionary encoding is not used for Long and Float dimensions. No index structures are currently created for numeric dimensions. Numeric dims will use the existing long/float column formats on disk.\n- The DimensionSelector interface now has additional functions for retrieving rows from numeric dimension columns. There are separate functions for long/float primitives, to avoid primitive boxing/unboxing. Benchmark runs showed a fairly significant increase in processing time when using a Comparable instead of IndexedInts directly.\n- As there are no bitmap indexes on numeric dims, a full scan will be performed on numeric dims for filtering logic that uses filter.getBitmapIndex()\n- To support the requirement above, ColumnSelectorBitmapIndexSelector now supports bitmap generation from the result of a column scan\n- SelectorFilter can do direct numeric comparisons on Long/Float columns, no string conversion needed\n- Long and Float values will be converted to Strings for any filters or extraction functions that require String inputs.\n- null values for Long and Float dims will be converted to 0L or 0.0F, respectively.\n- Three benchmarks have been added:\n  - IncrementalIndexAddRowsBenchmark: adds rows with different value types to IncrementalIndex\n  - IndexedIntsWrapping: evaluates performance of wrapping/unboxing of ints\n  - QueryableIndexLoadingBenchmark: evaluates performance of reading from a QueryableIndex with/without integer boxing, using DimensionSelectors\n\nUnit test notes:\n- The druid.sample.tsv file has been modified to include Long and Float dimension columns (market_long, market_float, quality_long, quality_float). The original druid.sample.tsv file has been kept in the repo.\n- The numeric values for these new dimensions have a 1-to-1 mapping with the values in 'market' and 'quality'\n- For larger test suites like GroupByQueryRunnerTest and TopN, I have parameterized the use of the \"quality\" and \"market\" dimensions; in different test iterations, the tests will use the long or float versions of these dimension columns.\n- Smaller test suites have separate functions for testing numeric dimensions.\n\nExample benchmark run showing difference between using Comparable (loadQIndexWrap) and IndexedInts (loadQIndex)\n\n```\n64 dim, 20000 cardinality\nBenchmark                                       Mode  Cnt  Score   Error  Units\nQueryableIndexLoadingBenchmark.loadQIndexWrap  avgt  100  1.414 ± 0.016

test suite demonstrates an inconsistency with LexicographicTopN\n\nThe LexicographicTopN sorting method uses a byte comparator with the string represented in UTF-8.\n\nThis is equivalent to String natural sorting for many cases, but fails to produce the same result for some complex multi-byte (and multi-character) strings.\n\nThis test captures a few of the failure cases.\n\nThis can be an issue if cursors assume sequential access, and the lexicographic comparison point is different than the `Arrays.sort(dimArray)` ordering.

Indices for dimension are not compressed well and makes bigger (~50%) sized output. But by setting dimension compressed UNCOMPRESSED, the output is always pad with 64K, which is default size of CompressedPools. I think we should use VSizeIndexedIntsWriter instead of CompressedVSizeIntsIndexedWriter in UNCOMPRESSED configuration.\n## \n\nWe are testing druid in industry realm and I've unexpectedly found that the size reduction of data could be important appeal point of using druid (1/10 ~ 1/30 for parquet/snappy but druid easily achieves 1/100). Trying to make this more apparent I've found in the most cases compressing index makes bigger sized footprint than original size of it. But disabling compression made 64K padding attached and makes it bigger again.

pull request attempts to rectify a bunch of dependency resolution issues seen in the 0.9.0 branch.\n- PullDeps now does not attempt to traverse a dependency if it shouldn't. Previously if a dependency were listed as a `test` scope dependency, and that test dependency had a compile dependency, the compile dependency would be brought in. This caused some extra libraries to be grabbed when they shouldn't have been.\n- PullDeps no longer has ANY excludes, and instead relies on extensions to manage their poms properly.\n- `<scope>provided</scope>` added in more places. Lots more places no properly list dependencies appearing in core druid as provided.\n- HadoopTask LOCAL ClassLoader ordering fixed. Some of the dependencies brought in extensions (like the druid-spark-batch extension) will fail if there is a library in the hadoop directory which conflicts with it. This ordering change allows the extensions to use a library with the expected version as much as possible. This has the most effect in things which might be accessed during the hadoop `runTask` call on the peons. And should NOT change the behavior of a task that is running in a hadoop or spark framework (the same job jars are still added in the same

The main thread holds the lock on \"handlers\" in Lifecycle.addMaybeStartHandler, which it\n   took because it's trying to add the ExecutorLifecycle to the lifecycle. main is trying\n   to get the

doing #2566 , I realised, most of the time when we are using IncrementalIndex for groupBy merging, it is not necessary to maintain sorted map.\nSince unsorted hashmaps are more efficient in both speed and memory usage, this PR changes groupBy processing to avoid sorting while merging whenever possible.\n\nNote that this has no user impact in terms of functionality as non-sorted index would be used only during intermediate merging.\n\nalso, a next step to #2325 . I am trying to push facts map off-heap as well and turns out it is again more efficient to maintain off-heap hash map than sorted

the pull-deps tool within the distribution module POM to the local maven repository via command-line option makes the build more robust when executed in CI environments like Jenkins.\n\nWithout this modification, the pull-deps tool would try to construct the path to the local maven repository by using the \"user.home\" system property which can be brittle within Jenkins builds or  could be hard to set up correctly as it entails making global config changes to Jenkins.\n\nAs the path to the local maven repo is available within maven poms as a builtin property, it is safe to use it to point the pull-deps tool to the same repository location that other druid maven modules used to install their artifacts to.

PR includes a new integration test that does hadoop indexing.\n\nI wanted to keep this new test separate from the existing tests, so that it wouldn't run with the \"mvn -P integration-tests\" command.  That's because I thought it reasonable to expect that not all test environments would have access to hadoop (that's true of some our test environments).  Also, the current setup of docker does not include hadoop access.  I expect it's possible to add that, but I didn't want to do that as part of this PR.\n\nSo, I put the test into a new package \"hadoop\" so that it's easy to exclude it in testng.xml.  Testng does not seem to provide a way to exclude classes or methods from included packages.  I could have changed to listing the classes, but it would be reasonable not to want to have to edit testng.xml when adding an indexer or query test.\n\nI decided to make configurable the location of the input data in hdfs, because (like for us) folks running the test might be constrained as to the location of space in hdfs that's available for their use.\n\nI made a couple of changes to make it possible to express that configured value when using docker, in anticipation of running the test that way someday.

https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/2439 there is one key aspect not taken into account and missing in the unit tests:  the `io.druid.guice.JsonConfigurator` treats things in the properties that start with `[` or `{` as json objects instead of strings. As such, the tests which check for compliance without going through the JsonConfigurator miss this fact.\n\nThis adds a second option in addition to the `jsonOpts` called `jsonOptsArray` which allows the specification of a json array that is properly handled by the JsonConfigurator. These two properties are additive and this change is backwards compatible.
