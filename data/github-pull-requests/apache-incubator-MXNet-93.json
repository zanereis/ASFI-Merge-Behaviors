#4713 collected all current issues with rcnn example. This pr is tested on MXNet Jan.12 (a week ago). All VOC experiments have been verified and reported using MXNet-v0.9.1. I don't think there is any need to verify the 12 commits added since last week.\r\n\r\nWith this pr:\r\n1. training and testing speed is accelerated.\r\n2. module testing replaced executor.reshape.\r\n3. added resnet support.\r\n4. added coco dataset, where the performance with resnet will be tuned in the future.\r\n5. minor adjustments for nnvm.\r\n6. solved many issues collected.\r\n\r\nRelationship with past pr on rcnn example:\r\n(in short, I have included or used equivalent implementation)\r\n#3173: wont fix, because numpy 1.8.2+ supports blank indexing, i.e. a[b] where b = []\r\n#3327: changes are equivalent.\r\nexample/rcnn/demo.py: load_param returns num_class. changed to config controlled behavior.\r\nexample/rcnn/helper/processing/bbox_transform.py: clip is not necessary to stablize training.\r\n#3495: windows string template support, included\r\nexecutor.reshape, ignored (replaced by module.predict)\r\nsymbol BlockGrad, included\r\nremove warmup scheduler, ignored because it is not necessary at first.\r\n#3641: remove an argument, ignored (not necessary)\r\n#4136: install monitor, included\r\n#4221: ignored, need more experiments on zfnet to merge\r\n\r\nRemaining issues:\r\n(all of the following will not work in v0.8 either)\r\n1. Python3/Windows environment unknown\r\n2. No mx.image usage\r\n3. 4G memory for VGG. py-faster-rcnn(caffe) uses 3G. May have to solve it later.\r\n\r\nAll in all:\r\nAt least everything works if they worked

of https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/pull/4403\r\n\r\n1. Fix the argument of batch_dot\r\n2. New operators: topk, sort, argsort, arange. (Also, the previous internal operators _zeros and _ones have been added to the python script as mx.sym.zeros and mx.sym.ones)\r\n3. Move operator to operator/tensor: BlockGrad\r\n4. Add the argument dtype to initialization operators (_zeros, _ones, _arange)\r\n5. Enable gradient for `argmax` and `argmin` by adding the gradient node to `_zeros`.\r\n\r\nSome Notes:\r\n\r\n1) The implementation of TopK is not so optimized at this stage. The implementation is to first sort the data and then keep the top k indices/values. In the future,  we will try to refactor the implementation using CUB(https://nvlabs.github.io/cub/)\r\n2) The \"axis\" argument is supported in topk and topk is equivalent to argsort and sort if we set \"k<1\" and ret_typ = \"indices\" or \"value\"\r\n3) The arange operator has an additional \"repeat\" argument, which indicates the number of times each element will be repeated in the generation process. This can be helpful for implementing the \"meshgrid\".\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-06T15:50:21Z","updated_at":"2017-01-08T04:49:03Z","closed_at":"2017-01-07T15:07:43Z","merged_at":"2017-01-07T15:07:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"9f9c135bbb8853351c927caf5c53e5a9524f156f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/4565/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/4565/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4565/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/312ab2d7ad4e2aa1e6a6e7ab66341d982bf8a590","head":{"label":"sxjscience:topk_arange_rebase5","ref":"topk_arange_rebase5","sha":"312ab2d7ad4e2aa1e6a6e7ab66341d982bf8a590","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44923569,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDkyMzU2OQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"sxjscience/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience/mxnet","description":"

I will fix issue with the script and submit corresponding installation guide documentation in a separate PR.","created_at":"2017-01-06T00:41:45Z","updated_at":"2017-08-15T16:45:54Z","closed_at":"2017-01-06T17:54:29Z","merged_at":"2017-01-06T17:54:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"12cdde6208a618f07e9a9dc724350ba4b337c2a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/4556/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/4556/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4556/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/1c6975c2ffcc030047383c792082590ef505e792","head":{"label":"sandeep-krishnamurthy:fix_installation_issue","ref":"fix_installation_issue","sha":"1c6975c2ffcc030047383c792082590ef505e792","user":{"login":"sandeep-krishnamurthy","id":3403674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDM2NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3403674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy","html_url":"https://github.com/sandeep-krishnamurthy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b67a4457ffd162ce8e7b7eca96285111362e74b9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight, Portable, Flexible Distributed/Mobile Deep Learning with Dynamic, Mutation-aware Dataflow Dep Scheduler;
