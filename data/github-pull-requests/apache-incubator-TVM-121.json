was experiencing an error, where grouped convolution didn't work for `groups!=num_input_channels`.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that in `python/tvm/relay/op/nn/_nn.py`, if `groups!=1`, then depthwise convolution is used.  This is incorrect, since a depthwise convolution is `groups==input_channels`.\r\n\r\nThis pull request attempts to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nHowever, note that the `attrs` object does not have a property for `input_channels`, only `output_channels`.  The latter is what the fix uses. This does not affect correctness in the current implementation, since depthwise convolution always has `input_channels==output_channels`.\r\n\r\nHowever, if depthwise convolution has a `depth_multiplier` parameter, where `N` filters are applied to each input channel, then the current bug fix would not be correct.  As it stands, depth multiplied depthwise convolutions do not seem to be implemented right now.\r\n\r\n[This Jupyter notebook](https://gist.github.com/Wheest/d19a6aab0dca86f783404ba63b670300) demonstrates the problem that the PR fixes.\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-13T11:04:07Z","updated_at":"2019-04-29T17:59:34Z","closed_at":"2019-04-29T17:59:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"69666cd8e061b3502e1a95e0232b4859c576573d","assignee":{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":961828004,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NjE4MjgwMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20update","name":"status:

PR converts a good chunk of TVM's global `PackedFunc`s to be `TypedPackedFunc`s. Right now, this shouldn't actually change any behavior, since the type information is immediately discarded once the functions are registered in the `Registry`. \r\n\r\nIt does make things a lot shorter, using a few helper methods I added on `Registry`: `set_body_simple`, `set_body_method`, and `set_body_node_method` (names up for debate). These helpers use the properties of function pointers to infer argument and return types:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nTVM_REGISTER_API(\"make.Realize\")\r\n.set_body([](TVMArgs args,  TVMRetValue *ret) {\r\n    *ret = Realize::make(args[0], args[1], args[2], args[3], args[4], args[5]);\r\n  }); \r\n```\r\n\r\nbecomes ->\r\n\r\n```\r\nTVM_REGISTER_API(\"make.Realize\")\r\n.set_body_simple(Realize::make);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is shorter, runtime-equivalent, and also now has type information!\r\n\r\nI don't believe this change has much runtime cost. It might interfere with inlining in some cases, would have to measure. Also, `PackedFunc`s aren't intended to be all that fast anyway.\r\n\r\nSo, that's the refactoring part.

PR adds googletest as a submodule to make it easier for new contributors to run tests; it's challenging to globally install googletest on OS X, this makes things a little simpler. It's a small download (5mb), a fast build (like 5 seconds), and has a permissive license, so i don't forsee this causing problems. Of course, it is another vendored dependency, so if people don't think it's worth it I understand.\r\n\r\nI used the 1.7.0 release tag since that was what travis seemed to be

comment for hd is wrong - type checking fail because it should (there is no sensible match)\r\nand I strongly argue against having a nil_case for tl that return silently:\r\n0: it is bad to silent error and return a 'very innocent value'. suppose tl actually got passed a nil somewhere in code. it will return a nil, and it will continue execution as if everything is normal (because nil is completely normal in list (it does not mean null)). it might trigger more silent error, returning more and more 'nil', and in the end you get the wrong value. Now this is extremely hard to debug, as you can not know which nil is 'nil because of failed tl match' or 'nil because it denote a completely normal empty list'. \r\n1: it is not how tl/cdr is defined in scheme/ocaml/haskell/etc. it will confuse people.\r\n\r\n@wweic does this sounds reasonable to

partial fix for #2890. It enables fusing through TupleGetItemNode.\r\n\r\nThe strategy is similar to the TupleNode case, but a special care is needed to handle the reference type. Since the gradient pass generates many TupleNode, TupleGetItemNode and Reference nodes under the hood, and references do not play well with fusion, I simply avoid fusing through reference nodes.\r\n\r\nA CPU/GPU execution test is [added](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2914/files#diff-1e57c4bb696ece85dec7e3fbf6eaa0f5R131), as requested.\r\n\r\nExample: GRU-ish unit\r\n\r\nBefore this

tried to run autotvm for custom ARM device recently and found that current autotvm requires edge device to have build tools (gcc, g++, ld) in order to link `tar(.o)` file to `.so` file.\r\n\r\nIt might be a situation when custom ARM devices has minimal linux installation which does not have `gcc, g++ and ld` tools installed. Also it might be missing package managers like `apt`.\r\n\r\nI found that it is possible to cross compile and export shared object (`.so` file) for edge device on tracker side using `cc` parameter in `lib.export_library`.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces `default_build_func` and `android_ndk_build_func` identical methods with function   `make_build_func` returning `build_func`.\r\nI also updated

PR contains one step of #2588\r\n\r\n- [x] CanonicalSimplifier Infra\r\n- [x] Support \"split normal form\" to handle simplification of div mod expressions\r\n- [x] Move the old Canonical simplification to the new one\r\n- [x] Move the reduction simplification to the new infra.\r\n\r\nThe main highlight of this PR is the introduction of the \"split normal form\", so we can simplify the following expression.\r\n```\r\nx/6*6 + (((x/3) % 2)*3) + (x % 3) => x\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is quite fun to implement the split normalization. Currently, we only support constant div and mod co-efficient for simplicity, we can consider adding symbolic support later.","created_at":"2019-03-25T03:54:43Z","updated_at":"2019-03-31T22:26:33Z","closed_at":"2019-03-31T22:06:49Z","merged_at":"2019-03-31T22:06:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"7afbca5691fdb599cd90b043d5a5036e55cae2d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/2891/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/2891/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2891/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/f5151fe4b731bc66d1223a993b7c10a86af27cb4","head":{"label":"tqchen:canonical","ref":"canonical","sha":"f5151fe4b731bc66d1223a993b7c10a86af27cb4","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqc
