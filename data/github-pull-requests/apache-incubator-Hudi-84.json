What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nDefault value of number of delta commits required to do inline compaction (hoodie.compact.inline.max.delta.commits) is currently 1. Because of this by default every delta commit to MERGE ON READ table is doing inline compaction as well automatically.\r\n\r\nI think default value of 1 is little overkill and also it will make MERGE ON READ work like COPY ON WRITE with compaction on every run. I am propsing to increaset the value to old default of 10.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Increate default for hoodie.compact.inline.max.delta.commits from 1 to 10*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-110\r\n\r\nAdd an example to support the Spark auto partition extractor to improve read performance.\r\nWith the existing way how we query the ReadOptimized table through Spark, we can take advantage of https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-parquet.html#partition-discovery directly. This feature only support folder structure like `/partitionKey=partitionValue` and `partitionValue` could be `String` or `Int`\r\n\r\nThis feature only applies to the Spark internally supported file format. If we use a custom relation, we will need a custom partition parser to extract partition from the path. This was handled by [DataSource](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/DataSource.scala#L147) internally.\r\n\r\nWe need to add this example to the doc as well.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add test to demo Spark Partition Discovery.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added unit test testSparkAutoPartition*\r\n \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is

are users who had been directly using RDD APIs and have relied on a behavior in 0.4.x to allow multiple write operations (upsert/buk-insert/...) to be executed within a single commit. \r\n\r\nGiven Hudi commit protocol, these are generally unsafe operations and user need to handle failure scenarios. It only works with COW table. Hudi 0.5.x had stopped this behavior.\r\n\r\nGiven the importance of supporting such cases for the user's migration to 0.5.x, we are proposing a safety flag (disabled by default) which will allow this old

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes the issue with running hive standalone tool mentioned here https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/issues/1610 . The error surfaced after the merging of https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/pull/1559 . It brought to forefront a couple of misses in hudi-hive-sync-bundle packaging:\r\n- Avro was not shaded and relocated in the bundle. It is required to be shaded here similar to hadoop-mr-bundle because hive otherwise uses an older version of avro causing runtime issues.\r\n- Parquet avro even though it was added to shade plugin, was not actually getting shaded because the dependency is labelled as **provided** in the parent POM. It had to be explicitly made a compile time dependency to be shaded.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Shading of avro and parquet-avro in hudi-hive-sync-bundle pom\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- Manually tested standalone hive-sync-tool on emr cluster\r\n- Added integration test for hive-sync-tool\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAdding ability to use hive metastore client instead of jdbc for hive table registration using spark datasource. This is needed for cases where Hive/HMS connections are secure. The thrift URL for HMS connection takes care of this automatically whereas for JDBC we would have to implement this in Hudi to support such cases. This is already added in HiveSyncConfig for HiveSyncTool, this PR just allows the ability to override that config through spark datasource\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-494\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an edge case: \r\nthe previous commit is very small but the bloom filter is large, this will cause the `totalWriteBytes` in the commit metadata not representing the record size. For example, commit1 only wrote 1 record but the parquet file is 20MB. This will lead to incorrect estimate record size and a very small number of [recordsToAppend](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/blob/master/hudi-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/table/action/commit/UpsertPartitioner.java#L155). Then Hudi will create many small files.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - changed `averageBytesPerRecord` function in two locations\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nHoodieDeltaStreamer create SchemaProvider instance and delegate to DeltaSync for periodical sync. However, default implementation of SchemaProvider does not refresh schema, which can change due to schema evolution. DeltaSync snapshot the schema when it creates writeClient, using the SchemaProvider instance or pick up from source, and the schema for writeClient is not refreshed during the loop of Sync.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduced a function to refresh schema after every run of DeltaSync.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n - When we read data from Kafka, we want to always read with the latest schema.\r\n - This allows us to make assumption throughout the rest of the pipeline that every record has the same schema.\r\n - We create a custom KafkaAvroDecoder that use the latest schema as read schema.\r\n - This does not work with all SchemaProvider yet.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Implemented HoodieAvroKafkaDeserializer for supplying readerSchema as per user's need.\r\n- Introduced a property to configure \"value.deserializer\" property for AvroKafkaSource. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n(or)\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end.*\r\n  - *Added HoodieClientWriteTest to verify the change.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job locally.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n

*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nSupport to store and read schema from **HoodieCommitMetadata** has been added in Hudi recently. This PR integrated Hive Sync to read schema from the metadata, and fallback to reading from files only if the schema from metadata is unavailable (for backwards compatibility).\r\n\r\nThis is a pre-requisite to https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-620 where we want to store the merged bootstrap schema in commit metadata and obtain it during hive-sync. This avoids us having to look up the indexes for external files and merging the schemas just for hive-sync.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR does a fix in HoodieWrite client to fallback on reading schema from the files in case schema from metadata is not available (for validating the schema).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fix in HoodieWriteClient to fallback on reading schema from files\r\n- Hive sync changes and unit tests to read schema from HoodieCommitMetadata\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added unit tests.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nSo far, the return type of HoodieRecordPayload#combineAndGetUpdateValue & HoodieRecordPayload#getInsertValue is effectively Option<GenericRecord>. Instead of doing unchecked cast at\r\n\r\norg/apache/hudi/hadoop/realtime/RealtimeCompactedRecordReader.java:88\r\n\r\nI propose we use Option<GenericRecord> as the return type of these two method, which replaces current Option<IndexedRecord>.\r\n\r\nFYI, I encounter this ticket when trying to get rid of self type parameter in HoodieRecordPayload and found that it is a bit awkward if we don't take a self type while doing this casting. Fortunately it is the fact that we can directly concrete it.\r\n\r\ncc @vinothchandar @leesf \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is code refactor should be covered by existing
