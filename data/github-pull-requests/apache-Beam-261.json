some point in the past, we decided to use a rawDataflowClient that\ndoes not do retries when checking job status, because it was best-effort\nreporting to users. The purported goal was to not clutter the log with\nnetworking errors.\n\nHowever, since that time, we have:\n- Added the ability to suppress logs (emit only at DEBUG level or not at\n  all) when retrying.\n- Increased reliability of the job checking status so that these errors\n  are less frequent and more indicative of quota or other issues.\n- Started using the metrics in tests, where we do need to retry\n  transient issues (BEAM-350).\n\nSo let's drop the raw transport client and just use the one

[x] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\n     [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\n\n---\n\nPreviously `PAssert` - hence all `RunnableOnService`/`NeedsRunner` tests - required side input support. This created a very steep on ramp for new runners.\n\n`GroupByKey` is a bit more fundamental and most backends will be able to group by key in the global window very quickly. So switching the primitive used to gather all the contents of a `PCollection` for assertions should make it a bit easier to get early feedback during runner development.\n\nThis exposed issues in a test, which is fixed in a separate commit, should you choose to review them separately.\n","created_at":"2016-06-08T23:33:16Z","updated_at":"2016-06-09T21:59:09Z","closed_at":"2016-06-09T21:58:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c93ab4b9c4d2e842e8e619cd67039cec465cf3c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/437/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/437/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/437/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/27ad3bd570c6668b8975a6fa2b36d3f2be80eaf8","head":{"label":"kennknowles:PAssert","ref":"PAssert","sha":"27ad3bd570c6668b8975a6fa2b36d3f2be80eaf8","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror
