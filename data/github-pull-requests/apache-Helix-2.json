screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhile creating JDK 1.8 (backward compatible) jars, we missed packaging of the `src/main/resources` contents in the jdk8 jar, as shown below.  We can see that in the `classes_jdk8` folder we are missing several properties files:\r\n<img width=\"431\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-16 at 10 08 26 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43e4fc14-28d3-4333-9b44-f58b146d4e66\">\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we are adding the `maven-resources-plugin` to generate resources in output directory, to fix packaging of `src/main/resources`.\r\n<img width=\"410\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-16 at 10 05 20 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/901d7af4-d181-42dd-aaeb-d7c350cdf0f0\">\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nValidated jar contents\r\n<img width=\"532\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-16 at 11 27 54 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba59cec3-c5d6-4bed-aea8-fd76eb9e647e\">\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently, when WAGED rebalancer encounters failure due to hard constraint (say insufficient capacity), it does not specify which key and reason of the insufficient capacity. Currently details are logged as part of the DEBUG messages and we have to turning on DEBUG logging to gain insights, and then turn off the helix DEBUG logging after the triage.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we are creating `ValidationResult` construct to better record the validation result details, which will be used produce a specific and detailed error message in case of Rebalance failure.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nUpdated existing tests:\r\n* TestConstraintBasedAlgorithm.java\r\n* TestFaultZoneAwareConstraint.java\r\n* TestNodeCapacityConstraint.java\r\n* TestNodeMaxPartitionLimitConstraint.java\r\n* TestPartitionActivateConstraint.java\r\n* TestReplicaActivateConstraint.java\r\n* TestSamePartitionOnInstanceConstraint.java\r\n* TestValidGroupTagConstraint.java\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\nmvn test -o \"-Dtest=Test*Constraint\" -pl=helix-core\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSTART TestPartitionLevelTransitionConstraint_test at Mon Jul 08 16:20:17 PDT 2024\r\nEND TestPartitionLevelTransitionConstraint_test at Mon Jul 08 16:20:25 PDT 2024\r\nAfterClass: TestPartitionLevelTransitionConstraint called.\r\nSTART testMsgConstraint() at Mon Jul 08 16:20:29 PDT 2024\r\nZnRecord=msgId-001, {CREATE_TIMESTAMP=1720480829984, FROM_STATE=OFFLINE, MSG_ID=msgId-001, MSG_STATE=new, MSG_TYPE=STATE_TRANSITION, RESOURCE_NAME=TestDB, TGT_NAME=localhost_12918, TO_STATE=SLAVE}{}{}, Stat=Stat {_version=0, _creationTime=0, _modifiedTime=0, _ephemeralOwner=0} matches(5): [{MESSAGE_TYPE=STATE_TRANSITION, TRANSITION=OFFLINE-SLAVE, RESOURCE=TestDB, INSTANCE=localhost_12918}:5, {MESSAGE_TYPE=STATE_TRANSITION}:ANY, {MESSAGE_TYPE=STATE_TRANSITION, TRANSITION=OFFLINE-SLAVE, RESOURCE=TestDB, INSTANCE=.*}:2, {MESSAGE_TYPE=STATE_TRANSITION, TRANSITION=OFFLINE-SLAVE, RESOURCE=.*, INSTANCE=.*}:10, {MESSAGE_TYPE=STATE_TRANSITION, TRANSITION=OFFLINE-SLAVE}:50]\r\nZnRecord=msgId-002, {CREATE_TIMESTAMP=1720480829992, FROM_STATE=OFFLINE, MSG_ID=msgId-002, MSG_STATE=new, MSG_TYPE=STATE_TRANSITION, RESOURCE_NAME=TestDB, TGT_NAME=localhost_12919, TO_STATE=SLAVE}{}{}, Stat=Stat {_version=0, _creationTime=0, _modifiedTime=0, _ephemeralOwner=0} matches(5): [{MESSAGE_TYPE=STATE_TRANSITION}:ANY, {MESSAGE_TYPE=STATE_TRANSITION, TRANSITION=OFFLINE-SLAVE, RESOURCE=.*, INSTANCE=localhost_12919}:1, {MESSAGE_TYPE=STATE_TRANSITION, TRANSITION=OFFLINE-SLAVE, RESOURCE=TestDB, INSTANCE=.*}:2, {MESSAGE_TYPE=STATE_TRANSITION, TRANSITION=OFFLINE-SLAVE, RESOURCE=.*, INSTANCE=.*}:10, {MESSAGE_TYPE=STATE_TRANSITION, TRANSITION=OFFLINE-SLAVE}:50]\r\nEND testMsgConstraint() at Mon Jul 08 16:20:29 PDT 2024\r\nSTART testStateConstraint() at Mon Jul 08 16:20:29 PDT 2024\r\n{STATE=MASTER, RESOURCE=TestDB} matches(3): [{STATE=MASTER, RESOURCE=.*}:2, {STATE=MASTER}:1, {STATE=MASTER, RESOURCE=TestDB}:1]\r\n{STATE=MASTER, RESOURCE=MyDB} matches(2): [{STATE=MASTER, RESOURCE=.*}:2, {STATE=MASTER}:1]\r\nEND testStateConstraint() at Mon Jul 08 16:20:30 PDT 2024\r\nAfterClass: TestConstraint called.\r\nShut down zookeeper at port 2183 in thread main\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 34, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 22.544 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 34, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/hkandwal/Documents/workspaces/projects/helix_os_hk/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 812 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:13 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2024-07-08T16:20:34-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

updateInstance(org.apache.helix.rest.server.TestPerInstanceAccessor) fixes #2744 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe cause of the test case being flaky is due to switching the resources from SEMI_AUTO to FULL_AUTO while the cluster is in MaintenanceMode.\r\n\r\nWhen a resource is SEMI_AUTO, the MM rebalancer is not used because that would cause the preferenceList to potentially change and never recover to what it previously was. In the test case, we were switching the resources from SEMI_AUTO to FULL_AUTO causing the MM rebalancer to be used. There is then a RACE condition between the controller computing a new IdealState which drops the offline instances from the preferenceList, making the IdealState invalid for SEMI_AUTO, and us setting the resources back to SEMI_AUTO. If the controller wins, persisting the IdealState again with SEMI_AUTO will throw an exception.\r\n\r\nRemoving this logic to just test that isEvacuateFinished is true since all resources are SEMI_AUTO. We test isEvacuateFinished on FULL_AUTO resources in other places like TestZkHelixAdmin and TestInstanceOperation.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] updateInstance(org.apache.helix.rest.server.TestPerInstanceAccessor) \r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#2816 \r\npartitionAssignment fails to calculate when there is FULL_AUTO resource that has `ANY_LIVEINSTANCE` for replica count.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\npartitionAssignment fails due to `Integer.parseInt(idealState.getReplicas())` in the `getIdealAssignmentForFullAuto` method. `idealState.getReplicas()` returns `\"ANY_LIVEINSTANCE\"` which then fails to be parsed to an int.\r\n\r\nThis change switches to the getReplicaCount() method which takes a default value if the replica count is ANY_LIVEINSTANCE. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nAdded a resource that utilizes ANY_LIVEINSTANCE into the testComputePartitionAssignmentMaintenanceMode test method. Without the changes to getReplicas()\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n$ mvn test -o -Dtest=TestPartitionAssignmentAPI.java -pl=helix-rest\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 147.587 s - in org.apache.helix.rest.server.TestPartitionAssignmentAPI\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-rest ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/gspencer/Desktop/git-repos/helix/helix-rest/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Restful Interface' with 95 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  02:34 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2024-06-26T16:23:02-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\nChange to the return value of getReplicas when called on a resource with ANY_LIVEINSTANCE as its replica count. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#2815\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nUser reporting that when they make heap dump on an app that uses leader election client for leadership orchestration, the participant ZNode is gone. The node is still the leader.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by a race condition between Helix ZkClient reconnect and native ZooKeeper client life cycle. \r\nZooKeeper client will close the client when expired.\r\nCONNECTED->EXPIRED->CLOSED\r\nIn Helix, ZkClient will create a new native ZooKeeper client, and close the old one when the old client has session expired. (code link https://github.com/apache/helix/blob/master/zookeeper-api/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/zookeeper/zkclient/ZkConnection.java#L116) \r\n\r\nIn most cases, the previous ZooKeeper client is closed by Helix ZkClient after Helix ZkClient switched to a new client. So HelixZkClient will vener receive the \"Closed\" state event. Helix ZkClient will send out state change event `EXPIRED->CONNECTED`\r\nHowever, sometimes the client closes it self before Helix ZkClient switched to a new client, thus, Helix ZkClient will receive \"Closed\" state event.  . Helix ZkClient will send out state change event `EXPIRED->CLOSED->CONNECTED`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nReproduce this issue by adding breakpoint in ZK code. Verified before/after behavior. \r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

This is backwards incompatible. We are adding defaults in this PR that throw not implemented exception.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-13T18:04:17Z","updated_at":"2024-06-13T18:09:33Z","closed_at":"2024-06-13T18:09:33Z","merged_at":"2024-06-13T18:09:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"76f8a83e0b6ed5b8f09739bd00f08da8667717ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2809/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2809/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2809/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/58300c94cd19ba2d4bac5f643627385b18f5ef9d","head":{"label":"zpinto:zpinto/fix_compatibility","ref":"zpinto/fix_compatibility","sha":"58300c94cd19ba2d4bac5f643627385b18f5ef9d","user":{"login":"zpinto","id":20071182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDcxMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20071182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto","html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627637862,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWj-Zg","name":"helix","full_name":"zpinto/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zpinto","id":20071182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDcxMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20071182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto","html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto/helix","description":"Apache

are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWe have some consumers which are still running their (open-source) systems on JRE-8, hence they are not able to run helix libraries compiled with JDK11+. We would like to provide a backward compatible support to our consumers where they also have an option to use JDK-8 compiled helix-core jar, if they have such a requirement. By default we will generate JDK-11 jars and JDK-8 jars using a classifier.\r\n```\r\n<major.minor.patch> will use JDK11 (default)\r\n<major.minor.patch> classifier say jdk8 , will use JDK8\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we are enabling the the full sub-tree of the `helix-core` and `meta-client` modules. This includes:\r\n- helix-common\r\n- zookeeper-api\r\n- metadata-store-directory-common\r\n- metrics-common\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] --- install:2.5.2:install (default-install) @ helix-common ---\r\n...\r\n[INFO] Installing /Users/hkandwal/Documents/workspaces/projects/helix_os_hk/helix-common/target/helix-common-1.3.2-SNAPSHOT-jdk8.jar to /Users/hkandwal/.m2/repository/org/apache/helix/helix-common/1.3.2-SNAPSHOT/helix-common-1.3.2-SNAPSHOT-jdk8.jar\r\n```\r\n```\r\n[INFO] --- install:2.5.2:install (default-install) @ zookeeper-api ---\r\n...\r\n[INFO] Installing /Users/hkandwal/Documents/workspaces/projects/helix_os_hk/zookeeper-api/target/zookeeper-api-1.3.2-SNAPSHOT-jdk8.jar to /Users/hkandwal/.m2/repository/org/apache/helix/zookeeper-api/1.3.2-SNAPSHOT/zookeeper-api-1.3.2-SNAPSHOT-jdk8.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- install:2.5.2:install (default-install) @ metadata-store-directory-common ---\r\n...\r\n/Users/hkandwal/.m2/repository/org/apache/helix/metadata-store-directory-common/1.3.2-SNAPSHOT/metadata-store-directory-common-1.3.2-SNAPSHOT-jdk8.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] --- install:2.5.2:install (default-install) @ metrics-common ---\r\n...\r\n[INFO] Installing /Users/hkandwal/Documents/workspaces/projects/helix_os_hk/metrics-common/target/metrics-common-1.3.2-SNAPSHOT-jdk8.jar to /Users/hkandwal/.m2/repository/org/apache/helix/metrics-common/1.3.2-SNAPSHOT/metrics-common-1.3.2-SNAPSHOT-jdk8.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

the replica is set to ANY_LIVEINSTANCE, we encounter a NumberFormatException and return (as we try to get the replica count as Integer) before calculating rest of the metrics which includes the

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #2779\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWe have some consumers which are still running their (open-source) systems on JRE-8, hence they are not able to run helix libraries compiled with JDK11+. \r\n\r\nWe would like to provide a backward compatible support to our consumers where they also have an option to use JDK-8 compiled helix-core jar, if they have such a requirement. By default we will generate JDK-11 jars and JDK-8 jars using a classifier. \r\n```\r\n<major.minor.patch> will use JDK11 (default)\r\n<major.minor.patch> classifier say jdk8 , will use JDK8\r\n```\r\n### For JDK-11 usecase\r\n```\r\n      <dependency>\r\n          <groupId>org.apache</groupId>\r\n          <artifactId>meta-client</artifactId>\r\n          <version>1.3.4</version>\r\n      </dependency>\r\n```\r\n### For JDK-8 usecase\r\n```\r\n      <dependency>\r\n          <groupId>org.apache</groupId>\r\n          <artifactId>meta-client</artifactId>\r\n          <version>1.3.4</version>\r\n          <classifier>jdk8</classifier>\r\n      </dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"444\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-07 at 12 20 22 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/helix/assets/2539436/a2b3d542-739c-44fc-8053-bca9e919285a\">\r\n\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nmvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip.exec=true\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- compiler:3.12.1:compile (JDK 8) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Recompiling the module because of changed dependency.\r\n[INFO] Compiling 579 source files with javac [forked debug release 8] to target/classes_jdk8\r\n[WARNING] [options] source value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release\r\n[WARNING] [options] target value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release\r\n[WARNING] [options] To suppress warnings about obsolete options, use -Xlint:-options.\r\n[WARNING] Overwriting artifact's file from /Users/hkandwal/Documents/workspaces/projects/helix_os_hk/helix-core/target/classes to /Users/hkandwal/Documents/workspaces/projects/helix_os_hk/helix-core/target/classes_jdk8\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- compiler:3.12.1:compile (JDK 11) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Recompiling the module because of changed dependency.\r\n[INFO] Compiling 579 source files with javac [forked debug release 11] to target/classes\r\n[WARNING]   on the class path.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] Deprecate HELIX_DISABLED_REASON and HELIX_DISABLED_TYPE as we will no longer be using the HELIX_ENABLED field and this reason field is too specific to HELIX_ENABLED.\r\n- [x] Refactor InstanceOperation into listField which will look like:\r\n```\r\n\"HELIX_INSTANCE_OPERATIONS\" : [\"{\\\"OPERATION\\\":\\\"ENABLE\\\",\\\"SOURCE\\\":\\\"AUTOMATION\\\",\\\"TIMESTAMP\\\":\\\"1716510701306\\\",\\\"REASON\\\":\\\"Cloud event in DefaultCloudEventCallback at 1716510701283\\\"}\",\"{\\\"OPERATION\\\":\\\"ENABLE\\\",\\\"SOURCE\\\":\\\"DEFAULT\\\",\\\"TIMESTAMP\\\":\\\"1716510659104\\\",\\\"REASON\\\":\\\"\\\"}\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDeprecate HELIX_DISABLED_REASON and HELIX_DISABLED_TYPE and refactor INSTANCE_OPERATION to be HELIX_INSTANCE_OPERATIONS listField.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent conflicts from different clients setting the InstanceOperation. We will now introduce the HELIX_INSTANCE_OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe list will be ordered by the earliest to the most recent operations. As before, any client using the old helix enabled APIs will always take precedence over the INSTANCE_DISABLED_OVERRIDABLE_OPERATIONS when those fields are set.\r\n\r\nWhen users of the new InstanceOperation APIs set the operation type to be DISABLE, we will also set the old HELIX_ENABLED field for backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nFor all invocations of InstanceOperation APIs, the source will be USER unless otherwise specified. In most cases, this is the trigger used. If an AUTOMATION source is used a separate entry will made in the list. Whichever non ENABLE InstanceOperation entry was created last is the active InstanceOperation that is used in the controller and the returned from getInstanceOperation API.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Added TestInstanceConfig#testInstanceOperationReason\r\n- [x] Added TestInstanceConfig#testInstanceOperationMultipleSources\r\n- [x] Added TestZkHelixAdmin#testSetInstanceOperation\r\n- [x] Fix lots of tests to use new APIs \r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- This change is backwards compatible with HELIX_DISABLED_REASON and HELIX_DISABLED_TYPE.\r\n- This is backwards incompatible with InstanceOperation simpleField being removed, but that has not been released in open source yet, so it is only a consideration for internal release.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #2779\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWe have some consumers which are still running their (open-source) systems on JRE-8, hence they are not able to run helix libraries compiled with JDK11+. \r\n\r\nWe would like to provide a backward compatible support to our consumers where they also have an option to use JDK-8 compiled helix-core jar, if they have such a requirement. By default we will generate JDK-11 jars and JDK-8 jars using a classifier. \r\n```\r\n<major.minor.patch> will use JDK11 (default)\r\n<major.minor.patch> classifier say jdk8 , will use JDK8\r\n```\r\n### For JDK-11 usecase\r\n```\r\n      <dependency>\r\n          <groupId>org.apache</groupId>\r\n          <artifactId>meta-client</artifactId>\r\n          <version>1.3.4</version>\r\n      </dependency>\r\n```\r\n### For JDK-8 usecase\r\n```\r\n      <dependency>\r\n          <groupId>org.apache</groupId>\r\n          <artifactId>meta-client</artifactId>\r\n          <version>1.3.4</version>\r\n          <classifier>jdk8</classifier>\r\n      </dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"444\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-07 at 12 20 22 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/helix/assets/2539436/a2b3d542-739c-44fc-8053-bca9e919285a\">\r\n\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nmvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip.exec=true\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- compiler:3.12.1:compile (JDK 8) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Recompiling the module because of changed dependency.\r\n[INFO] Compiling 579 source files with javac [forked debug release 8] to target/classes_jdk8\r\n[WARNING] [options] source value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release\r\n[WARNING] [options] target value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release\r\n[WARNING] [options] To suppress warnings about obsolete options, use -Xlint:-options.\r\n[WARNING] Overwriting artifact's file from /Users/hkandwal/Documents/workspaces/projects/helix_os_hk/helix-core/target/classes to /Users/hkandwal/Documents/workspaces/projects/helix_os_hk/helix-core/target/classes_jdk8\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- compiler:3.12.1:compile (JDK 11) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Recompiling the module because of changed dependency.\r\n[INFO] Compiling 579 source files with javac [forked debug release 11] to target/classes\r\n[WARNING]   on the class path.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nLeaderElectionClient throws NPE if isLeader() is called before client joins leader election participant pool\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.NullPointerException\r\n      at org.apache.helix.metaclient.recipes.leaderelection.LeaderElectionClient.isLeader(LeaderElectionClient.java:124) ~[org.apache.helix.meta-client-1.3.2.jar:?]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdd null pointer check to isLeader() method. isLeader() will now return false when isLeader() is called before the client joins the leader election participant pool. \r\nAdded test to assert NPE no longer thrown and that isLeader() returns false in above scenario. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestIsLeaderBeforeJoiningParticipantPool in TestLeaderElection.java\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\nN/A, no backwards incompatibilities\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Summary\r\n\r\nCherry-pick: \r\n* Fix BestPossibleExternalViewVerifier to use a ZkClient that has the serializer set to ByteArraySerializer so it can read the assignment meta store best possible state. Fix BestPossibleExternalViewVerifier to actually calculate BEST_POSSIBLE instead of returning last persisted to ZK because we now need to consider handleDelayedRebalanceMinActiveReplica not being persisted to ZK(#2447). Fix handleDelayedRebalanceMinActiveReplica modifying in-memory _bestPossibleState in the _assignmentMetadataStore which was causing best possible state to continuosly be persisted until handleDelayedRebalanceMinActiveReplica wasn't kicking in anymore.\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\n\r\n- without fix for this condition, many znodes can be created under ASSIGNMENT_METADATA store faster than the

Issues\r\n\r\nFixes #2791 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhat: An API endpoint that validates the incoming request and sends a state transition message to sets one or more partitions from any current state to ERROR state.\r\n\r\nWhy: Currently, the participants are unable to set a partition to an ERROR state explicitly when they seem to be stuck in a specific current state. The only way a replica can be set to ERROR is from within a state model. Having an endpoint to allow this behavior would allow the clients to call the resetPartition endpoint to set it back to INIT state and recover the replica. resetPartition works only on partitions in error state.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n  \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  [INFO] Reactor Summary for Apache Helix 1.3.2-SNAPSHOT:\r\n  [INFO] \r\n  [INFO] Apache Helix .......................................

Issues\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #2777\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWhen entering maintenance-mode, we observed that instance order in preference list changes by PreferenceListNodeComparator as it uses the order in which the current-state is materialized in array list.\r\nFor instance:\r\nLets say we have 3 hosts, and here's the Current state:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   A: LEADER,\r\n   B: FOLLOWER\r\n   C: FOLLOWER\r\n }\r\n```\r\nNow when we create a preference-list using new ArrayList(currentState.keySet), the order in array-list depends on the hash order the keys (A, B, C). With sorting using PreferenceListNodeComparator, we put Leader at the front and ordering among Followers can be anything and could either be [A, B, C] or [A, C, B ]\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nAdded Tests:  `TestMaintenanceRebalancer.testComputeIdealState`\r\nThis covers various scenarios where the preference list should be preserved wrt current state\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip.exec=true && mvn test -o -Dtest=TestMaintenanceRebalancer -pl=helix-core\r\n\r\n[INFO] --- surefire:3.0.0-M3:test (default-test) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO]  T E S T S\r\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Running org.apache.helix.controller.rebalancer.TestMaintenanceRebalancer\r\nTest case comment: [Case 1] Same state - No (A, B, C) -> (A, C, B) for different hash order\r\n[lKmBBEPisM, 8PNpMU7EgT, HOs3rOFCad]\r\n[lKmBBEPisM, 8PNpMU7EgT, HOs3rOFCad]\r\nTest case comment: [Case 2] Same state - No (A, B, C) -> (A, C, B) for different hash order\r\n[Q3ZZuCeBpu, QY9U91XBYo, GMYBW20gmC]\r\n[Q3ZZuCeBpu, QY9U91XBYo, GMYBW20gmC]\r\nTest case comment: [Case 3] second becomes leader, (A, B, C) -> (B, A, C) for different hash order\r\n[8PNpMU7EgT, lKmBBEPisM, HOs3rOFCad]\r\n[8PNpMU7EgT, lKmBBEPisM, HOs3rOFCad]\r\nTest case comment: [Case 4] second becomes leader, (A, B, C) -> (B, A, C) for different hash order\r\n[QY9U91XBYo, Q3ZZuCeBpu, GMYBW20gmC]\r\n[QY9U91XBYo, Q3ZZuCeBpu, GMYBW20gmC]\r\nTest case comment: [Case 5] leader becomes offline, (A, B, C) -> (B, C, A) for different hash order\r\n[8PNpMU7EgT, HOs3rOFCad, lKmBBEPisM]\r\n[8PNpMU7EgT, HOs3rOFCad, lKmBBEPisM]\r\nTest case comment: [Case 6] leader becomes offline, (A, B, C) -> (B, C, A) for different hash order\r\n[QY9U91XBYo, GMYBW20gmC, Q3ZZuCeBpu]\r\n[QY9U91XBYo, GMYBW20gmC, Q3ZZuCeBpu]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3.983 s - in org.apache.helix.controller.rebalancer.TestMaintenanceRebalancer\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/hkandwal/Documents/workspaces/projects/helix_os_hk/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 950 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  42.293 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2024-03-14T11:50:53-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-14T18:52:16Z","updated_at":"2024-03-19T22:49:56Z","closed_at":"2024-03-19T22:49:56Z","merged_at":"2024-03-19T22:49:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"ce33735dda1dd8614cb8d84094119de1a4b30484","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2778/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2778/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2778/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/9aade4f7ee552e53e2c63d1f393f18b40dc754be","head":{"label":"himanshukandwal:hkandwal/add-determinism-to-the-maintenance-mode","ref":"hkandwal/add-determinism-to-the-maintenance-mode","sha":"9aade4f7ee552e53e2c63d1f393f18b40dc754be","user":{"login":"himanshukandwal","id":2539436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mzk0MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2539436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshukandwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":676756685,"node_id":"R_kgDOKFZ8zQ","name":"helix","full_name":"himanshukandwal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"himanshukandwal","id":2539436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mzk0MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2539436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshukandwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/himanshukandwal/helix","description":"Mirror

to ZK because we now need to consider handleDelayedRebalanceMinActiveReplica not being persisted to ZK(#2447).\r\n- [x] Fix handleDelayedRebalanceMinActiveReplica modifying in-memory _bestPossibleState in the _assignmentMetadataStore which was causing best possible state to continuosly be persisted until handleDelayedRebalanceMinActiveReplica wasn't kicking in anymore.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPR #2180 introduced a bug to BestPossibleExternalViewVerifier by reusing the zkClient passed to the builder. This can be an issue because the serializer is often set to ZNRecordSerializer instead of ByteArraySerializer. This failing verifier was not accurate since it was unable to read from the persisted best possible state in the assignment metadata store.\r\n\r\nPR #2447 moves the logic for handling min active replicas into the emergency rebalance method. This will make the DryRunWagedRebalancer inaccurate because it would previously just return the ZK persisted best possible state for due to the override of `computeBestPossibleAssignment`. We are removing this method because we need to recompute the idealAssignment in addition to just reading the ZK persisted best possible state in order to retain the overwrites for handling min active replicas.\r\n\r\nhandleDelayedRebalanceMinActiveReplica modifies the currentResourceAssignment map passed into it. Because the reference actually points to map in the assignmentMetaStore, hanledDelayedRebalanceMinActiveReplica is actually modifying the cache. This causes isBestPossibleChanged to evaluate to true whenever hanledDelayedRebalanceMinActiveReplica is kicking in and causes continuous writes of the same best possible produced by partial rebalance over and over. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nNA, issue with hanledDelayedRebalanceMinActiveReplica was caught after fixing BestPossibleExternalViewVerifier. Current tests are sufficient.\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] Deprecate the HELIX_ENABLED field in InstanceConfig and unify its functionality with InstanceOperation.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn order to unify HELIX_ENABLED functionality with InstanceOperation, InstanceOperation will now have the following options:\r\n- ENABLE: Node can host online replicas and is assignable\r\n- DISABLE: Node cannot host online replicas but can be assigned replicas\r\n- EVACUATE: Node can host online replicas but cannot be assigned new replicas\r\n- SWAP_IN: Node is being swapped in and can host online replicas but is not assigned replicas by the rebalancer. The mirroring is handled outside the rebalancer. SWAP_IN nodes are not populated in the RoutingTableProvider.\r\n- UNKNOWN: Node cannot host online replicas, is not assignable, and is not populated in the RoutingTableProvider.\r\n\r\nSWAP_IN will not be able to be set to DISABLE, since the SWAP_IN instance is not in the routing table it should not require a graceful way to move replicas to OFFLINE state.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Adjusted tests to use new APIs and kept tests using old APIs to ensure backwards compatibility\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nWill maintain backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nTo replace the HELIX_ENABLED config with InstanceOperation while maintaining backwards compatibility with old APIs we keep the behavior where helix will treat the instance as disabled if HELIX_ENABLED is set to false with the exception of SWAP_IN. If it is set to true, the controller will treat the instance based on the InstanceOperation that is set. All users on an old version of helix will be able to continue using `HelixAdmin().enableInstance` with the same behavior. Users on the latest version will be able to leverage the new APIs to do new operations available.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-04T20:12:41Z","updated_at":"2024-04-25T22:47:03Z","closed_at":"2024-04-25T22:47:03Z","merged_at":"2024-04-25T22:47:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"9e25ab5772e523406196a5c6da531ac557f4d1ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2772/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2772/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2772/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/4d4aa9e73f09953422926960b85e240842ef660e","head":{"label":"zpinto:zpinto/deprecate_helix_enabled_for_instance_operation","ref":"zpinto/deprecate_helix_enabled_for_instance_operation","sha":"4d4aa9e73f09953422926960b85e240842ef660e","user":{"login":"zpinto","id":20071182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDcxMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20071182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto","html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627637862,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWj-Zg","name":"helix","full_name":"zpinto/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zpinto","id":20071182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDcxMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20071182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto","html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto/helix","description":"Apache

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nDemonstrates how preference list order changes during maintenance mode.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWhen entering maintenance-mode, we observed that instance order in preference list changes by `PreferenceListNodeComparator` as it uses the order in which the current-state is materialized in array list. \r\nFor instance:\r\n\r\nLets say we have 3 hosts, and here's the Current state:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   A: LEADER,\r\n   B: FOLLOWER\r\n   C: FOLLOWER\r\n }\r\n```\r\nNow when we create a preference-list using `new ArrayList(currentState.keySet)`, the order in array-list depends on the hash order the keys (A, B, C).  With sorting using `PreferenceListNodeComparator`, we put Leader at the front and ordering among Followers can be anything and could either be [A, B, C] or [A, C, B ]\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n* Added TestMaintenanceRebalancer.testComputeIdealState\r\n\r\nThere 4 tests here:\r\n\r\nTest Case 1,2,3,4: Shows how ordering changes from existing one. \r\n                      current: [A, B, C] -> updated: [A, C, B]\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nWhen no resource or instance capacity keys are defined for a WAGED cluster, then WAGED does not try to ensure topstate evenness. In a cluster where the # participants = # replicas, each instance will have the same assignment. \r\n\r\nIf each resource has multiple partitions, then a degree of evenness will be achieved, but it could be improved. \r\n\r\nIf there is only 1 partition per resource and the # participants = # replicas, then one instance will be assigned leader for all resources as the tiebreak is the participant's logical ID. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCustomers should define resource weights and instance capacities to fully utilize the benefits of WAGED. However, for those that do not we should still consider top state evenness in WAGED assignment calculations. This PR adds changes to the \"TopStateMaxCapacityUsageInstanceConstraint\" soft constraint. Currently it preferentially assigns top state replicas to nodes with less top states based off the replica's weight. If no weight is defined for the resource and the node, then the score will always be 0 and tiebreak will be determined by the node's logicalID. \r\n\r\nThis change will make the soft constraint calculate the score based off the number of top states if there are no capacity keys defined for both the resource and the instance. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis only includes a very minor change of changing one test method's access modifier from private to public. I checked the CI logs and testNG has been successfully running this method, but convention is to set it to public. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestTopStateMaxCapacityUsageInstanceConstraint\r\n- testGetNormalizedScoreNoCapacityKeysDefined\r\n\r\n#### Manually tested distribution before and after change:\r\nNo Capacity keys defined for either the resources or the participants\r\n\r\n**Test 1**\r\n3 Participants, 20 WAGED Resources, 1 Partition Each. \r\n\r\n```\r\nBEFORE CHANGE:\r\nCount of Leader Assignments\r\n{localhost_12919=0, localhost_12918=20, localhost_12920=0}\r\n\r\nAFTER CHANGE:\r\nCount of Leader Assignments\r\n{localhost_12919=7, localhost_12918=7, localhost_12920=6}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Test 2**\r\n3 Participants, 20 WAGED Resources, 10 Partitios Each.\r\n```\r\nBEFORE CHANGE:\r\nCount of Leader Assignments\r\n{localhost_12919=60, localhost_12918=80, localhost_12920=60}\r\n\r\nAFTER CHANGE:\r\nCount of Leader Assignments\r\n{localhost_12919=67, localhost_12918=67, localhost_12920=66}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nRan PR CI against my personal fork, failed due to flaky test testEvacuationWithOfflineInstancesInCluster #2721\r\nhttps://github.com/GrantPSpencer/helix/actions/runs/7935782011/job/21669654755?pr=6\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nZooKeeper allows for calling delete with an expected version, where the znode will only be deleted if the version in the znode's stat matches the passed version number. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds APIs to the ZKClients to call delete with expected version\r\nAlso adds to the baseDataAccessors the API for remove with expected version. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n```\r\nTestZKBaseDataAccessor.java\r\n- testRemoveWithExpectedVersion\r\n\r\nRealmAwareZkClientFactoryTestBase.java\r\n- testDeleteExpectedVersion\r\n\r\n\r\nTestFederatedZkClient.java\r\n- testDeleteExpectedVersion\r\n```\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nCI run against my fork passed\r\nhttps://github.com/GrantPSpencer/helix/actions/runs/7909844995/job/21591541741?pr=5\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\nN/A. The original delete and remove methods just call the new method and pass in -1 as the expected version (meaning no version match is forced) \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] Add ability to use Evac + Add to swap instances with same logicalId\r\n- [x] Add ability to complete swap when swap out instance goes offline or is disabled\r\n- [x] Don't have downward ST on SWAP_IN node when SWAP_OUT goes offline or is disabled (Only allow when replica is dropped from SWAP_OUT during swap)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nModify the behavior of swap to continue bootstrapping second or top state on the swap in node regardless of if the swap out node is disabled or offline. We don't want either of those two cases to nullify the work already done during the swap. Modify HelixAdmin to allow evacuation to be used with adding a new instance with the same logicalId and allow for swap to complete when swap out instance is offline or disabled.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] testNodeSwapWithSwapOutInstanceOffline\r\n- [x] testNodeSwapWithSwapOutInstanceDisabled\r\n- [x] testNodeSwapAddSwapInFirst (had to remove the ability to do this to support two paths for evacuate)\r\n- [x] testSwapEvacuateAdd\r\n- [x] testSwapEvacuateAddRemoveEvacuate\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

The old method asserts same order\r\n```\r\npublic static void assertEquals(Collection actual, Collection expected, String message) {\r\n    if (actual != expected) {\r\n      if (actual == null || expected == null) {\r\n        if (message != null) {\r\n          fail(message);\r\n        } else {\r\n          fail(\"Collections not equal: expected: \" + expected + \" and actual: \" + actual);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      assertEquals(actual.size(), expected.size(), message + \": lists don't have the same size\");\r\n      Iterator actIt = actual.iterator();\r\n      Iterator expIt = expected.iterator();\r\n      int i = -1;\r\n\r\n      while(actIt.hasNext() && expIt.hasNext()) {\r\n        ++i;\r\n        Object e = expIt.next();\r\n        Object a = actIt.next();\r\n        String explanation = \"Lists differ at element [\" + i + \"]: \" + e + \" != \" + a;\r\n        String errorMessage = message == null ? explanation : message + \": \" + explanation;\r\n        assertEquals(a, e, errorMessage);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nsimply changing to assertEquals(set, set) calls a method that invokes the set.equals() method which does not care about ordering\r\n```\r\n  public static void assertEquals(Set actual, Set expected) {\r\n    if (actual != expected) {\r\n      if (actual == null || expected == null) {\r\n        fail(\"Sets not equal: expected: \" + expected + \" and actual: \" + actual);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      if (!actual.equals(expected)) {\r\n        fail(\"Sets differ: expected \" + expected + \" but got \" + actual);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nRunning CI on personal branch:\r\nhttps://github.com/GrantPSpencer/helix/actions/workflows/Helix-PR-CI.yml\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] For large clusters which take a long time to finish global and partial rebalance, there is a race condition. When assignableInstanceConfigMap and other related Maps and Sets are cleared and rebuilt, the async global and partial rebalance pipelines attempt to iterate through them.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nBecause we called clear() on the Maps and Sets in the cache while the global or partial rebalance is iterating over them, we have seen many ConcurrentModificationError exceptions causing these pipelines to fail. To remediate this, we will build new Maps and Sets on cache refresh and swap out the old Maps and Sets after we have built the new ones.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] No new tests are necessary, should keep the same behavior. \r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-29T20:24:41Z","updated_at":"2024-01-30T23:56:46Z","closed_at":"2024-01-30T23:56:45Z","merged_at":"2024-01-30T23:56:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"b8baca9897e4b64e0395cde3618a6d45b4891ebe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2746/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2746/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2746/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/9fae1e11b05675b91b99e3943d9b5db33de84569","head":{"label":"zpinto:zpinto/reduce_concurrent_modification_occurences","ref":"zpinto/reduce_concurrent_modification_occurences","sha":"9fae1e11b05675b91b99e3943d9b5db33de84569","user":{"login":"zpinto","id":20071182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDcxMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20071182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto","html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627637862,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWj-Zg","name":"helix","full_name":"zpinto/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zpinto","id":20071182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDcxMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20071182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto","html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto/helix","description":"Apache

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix SWAP to respect instance disabled state to send all assigned partitions to OFFLINE state. SWAP_IN instance will still have the same assignment as SWAP_OUT instance.\r\n- [x] Remove unnecessary logic to handle SWAP_IN node in preferenceList, this was from old approach.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPreviously, when a swap is initiated and the swap-in node has HELIX_ENABLED set to false, the replicas assigned to it are not sent to the OFFLINE state. In order to align with the behavior of HELIX_ENABLED = false, we will now send all assigned replicas to OFFLINE state. When the SWAP_IN instance is re-enabled, it will receive upward state transitions for its replicas.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Add test testNodeSwapDisableAndReenable\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nRemoved some public methods; however, they were not in an open source release and would likely cause more confusion if they were left.\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] Instance Evacuation is causing shuffling after dropping an evacuated node. This is a result of new baseline being computed.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe are now controlling the filtering of certain \"Assignable\" instances through the BaseControllerDataProvider. This will help centralize the logic and decouple it with the rebalancers. This PR migrates EVACUATE to this approach. Putting this logic here, allows methods like getAssignableInstanceConfigMap to respect the \"Assignable\" states. When the return value for this changes, a new baseline is computed. If it differs, which it will for evacuate, it will cause shuffling.\r\n\r\nWhen the baseline is calculated, whether it is enabled, live, or set to EVACUATE is not respected. The assignment assumes the \"happy path\" where all of these instances are assignable or will be assignable. When and EVACUATE node is dropped, it will force a differing baseline to be calculated. This will cause shuffling after the evacuation is complete.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, setting and InstanceOperation to EVACUATE will ensure that it does not get returned in getAssignable*. This forces the baseline to be recomputed without considering the EVACUATE instance. When the instance is dropped, the arguments to baseline computation are the same as the previous computation and there is no change.\r\n\r\nTo maintain N -> N + 1 -> N behavior, we change the computeBestPossiblePartition state to pass all liveInstances so that the replicas on the EVACUATE instance can still be part of the stateMap until the new replica is created.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Update testEvacuate to ensure no additional shuffling after the evacuated instance is dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- Removed some public methods; however, they were relatively new and would likely cause more confusion if they were left. If objections, I can deprecate them instead. Also, I don't think any were part of an open-source release.\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] PartitionAssignmentAPI returns incorrect finalMapping when changes are applied and real pipeline computes\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt was reported that the helix-rest partitionAssignmentAPI was returning an incorrect finalMapping. When the changes simulated were applied, the finalMapping generated by the controller was different. In theory, the finalMapping can be simulated correctly if all the inputs to the algorithm exactly match those passed in the controller.\r\n\r\nAfter investigation, it was found that the offlineTimeMap was not being cleared by the cache and the BEST_POSSIBLE_STATE was not being persisted to ZK each time a new version was being computed by partial rebalance. Fixing these two issues ensures that the pipeline produces the correct finalMapping and the partitionAssignmentAPI is not using a stale BEST_POSSIBLE_STATE to compute the simulated finalMapping.\r\n\r\nI have added integration tests to test that the pipeline produces the same finalMapping as the result generated by the partitionAssignmentAPI.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] testComputePartitionAssignmentAddInstance\r\n- [x] testComputePartitionAssignmentReplaceInstance\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description: \r\n        #2674 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently, WAGED consider many capacity categories/dimensions such as CPU, Disk, etc for the placement decision evenness scores. In some use case, only one dimension is relevant because the clusters are provisioned based on that category. And, if evenness scores are not based on that then it introduces more shuffle/movements.\r\n\r\nSo, we would like to provide a way for users to specify a prioritized evennessScoringKey that will help computing scores based on that category only.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n1. TestClusterContext \r\n\r\n- testEstimateMaxUtilization\r\n\r\n2. TestMaxCapacityUsageInstanceConstraint\r\n\r\n- testGetNormalizedScoreWithPreferredScoringKey\r\n\r\n3. TestTopStateMaxCapacityUsageInstanceConstraint\r\n\r\n- testGetNormalizedScoreWithPreferredScoringKey\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Reactor Summary for Apache Helix 1.3.2-SNAPSHOT:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Apache Helix .......................................

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nIn this PR, we are addressing the overall helix CI/CD performance\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nChanges to Boost performance include:\r\n\r\n**1. Using a standardized Helix ZK Client (TestHelper#createZkClient)** \r\nAllowed only one way to create ZK client and avoiding code duplication.\r\n\r\n**2. Removed un-necessary Thread.sleep**\r\nWe removed constant time Thread.sleep statements especially after methods that add implicit wait and ensure sync completion. These include:\r\n-  syncStop\r\n- syncStart\r\n- ZkHelixClusterVerifier.verifyByPolling()\r\n\r\n**3. Avoided adding all the BuiltInStateModelDefinitions** \r\nAllowed adding state-model defs  on-demand bases during the cluster creation, depending on the resource type. This is an optimization that we are performing to selectively load only the state-model defs that are required for cluster. We have found that loading all state-model defs everytime in a cluster creation takes about 500-700ms, due to invocation of ZKUtil::isClusterSetup function that (repeatedly) ensure all the helix cluster paths are created before loading a state-model.\r\n\r\nImproved Runtime: 1h 30m\r\nPrevious Runtime: 2h 10m\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2695\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWhen we encounter any java,lang.Error like [OutOfMemoryError](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/OutOfMemoryError.html), we do not handle it currently. This error is transient that are thrown while trying to create threads and such errors are rather common due to the need to allocate a native stack in Thread.start. This error goes away after some when native stack is cleaned up. We should ideally cleanup ZK state (remove the message) and allow Helix to continue working on failed task. Clean-up and retry code path should be executed on encountering Throwable of any type.\r\n\r\nWe are extending the scope from Exception to Throwable, to allow ZK state clean-up and retry code path to be executed on encountering java.lang.Error of any type as well.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-01-09 at 2 05 09 PM](https://github.com/apache/helix/assets/2539436/4b3d5adc-6926-427b-a1ba-3951e28f553d)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nAdded `testHandleThrowableErrors` in TestHelixTaskExecutor.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\nEND testUpdateAndFindMessageThreadpool\r\nSTART TestHelixTaskExecutor.testStaledMessage()\r\n49954 [main] ERROR org.apache.helix.messaging.handling.HelixTaskExecutor [] -

They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] testValidateResource currently failing on master branch. \r\n- [x] https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2717\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrent assumption is that this is due to the testclass utilizing the _instancesMap variable in AbstractTestClass. However, if there are other tests that add instances to the cluster but do not add it to the _instancesMap as well, then tests that only iterate over _instancesMap may miss instances in the cluster. In this case, we don't set the correct configs and the rebalance fails. \r\n\r\nThis may be failing now due to recently added/modified tests that have affected the order that the tests are run, or recently added tests that directly add an instance to the cluster. \r\n\r\nThis PR is simply to get the CI passing again. A future PR should look to refactor these tests to ensure we have more isolation between our tests. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] N/A\r\n\r\nI've run the CI on my personal branch here to confirm the changes are working:\r\nhttps://github.com/GrantPSpencer/helix/actions/workflows/Helix-PR-CI.yml?query=branch%3Afresh-fix-testvalidateresource\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] CustomizedStateProvider APIs only allow operations at a per partition level on a single instance. If a user wants to completely wipe a customizedState for a given resource or for all resources using this API, they currently need to implement logic to identify all relevant partitions and then delete them one by one. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n - [x] CustomizedStateProvider provides APIs to get, set, and delete customizedState information on a specific instance. This PR adds the ability to delete customizedState information at either the customizedStateName or resource level, which will allow for faster cleanup. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] testDeleteResourceCustomizedState - tests successful delete, deletes on non-existent resource and customizedState\r\n- [x] testDeleteAllResourcesCustomizedState - tests successful delete, deletes when no resources present and on non-existent customizedState\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nNone. No changes to current APIs, only new features added. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  - Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  - Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  - Subject does not end with a period\r\n  - Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  - Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  - Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n - My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml\r\n   (helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)","created_at":"2024-01-03T18:55:26Z","updated_at":"2024-01-25T05:30:34Z","closed_at":"2024-01-25T05:30:34Z","merged_at":"2024-01-25T05:30:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"bf8aa62541861eaaf414af53e90bd3a93503d1df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2724/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2724/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2724/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/39caa0c0916afd94e9ef21f1003fd8cbb59dc3fe","head":{"label":"GrantPSpencer:customized-state-api","ref":"customized-state-api","sha":"39caa0c0916afd94e9ef21f1003fd8cbb59dc3fe","user":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":645914891,"node_id":"R_kgDOJn_hCw","name":"helix","full_name":"GrantPSpencer/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer/helix","description":"Fork

Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe have a predefined secret in `.env` file called `SECRET_TOKEN`. User is supposed to override the value with the environment variable. We were not use the secret in our helix-front server side. This PR is to apply the logic, so secret can be generated by the user to align with the security requirements.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nManually tested with the secret override.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nIn this PR, we are addressing the overall helix CI/CD performance.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nChanges to Boost performance include:\r\n* Removal of `System.out.println` statements. Moving important ones to `LOG.info`\r\n* Using a standardized Helix ZK Client (TestHelper#createZkClient) with shorter timeouts (ConnectInitTimeout, OperationRetryTimeout, SessionTimeout)\r\n* Removed un-necessary Thread.sleep (especially  after syncStop and syncStart statements).\r\n* Avoided adding all the BuiltInStateModelDefinitions unnecessarily. Added on-demand bases, depending on the resource type.\r\n\r\nImproved Runtime: 1h 30m\r\nPrevious Runtime: 2h 10m \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/himanshukandwal/helix/actions/runs/7264671258\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/himanshukandwal/helix/actions/runs/7264671258\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] TestInstanceOperation was flaky, using TestHelper.verify should stabilize the test.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nStabilize TestInstanceOperation. clusterVerifier is evaluating to true once the partitionAssignment matches the expected value; however, it is before the TopState is transfered back to the SWAP_IN node. This can be fixed by using TestHelper.verify to check that states converge within TIMEOUT.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] TestInstanceOperation, ran 3 times and did not see any failures.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] Change all rebalancer strategies to create Topology without additional non-FaultZone or EndNode levels of the tree. This will allow for swap to work in clusters where the non-FaultZone or EndNode domain kv pairs don't directly match the swapping node. #2662\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] When attempting to use Swap in clusters that had more complex topologies with levels that were not fault zone or end node, it was discovered that Swap assignment was being computed correctly. This is because the levels and all nodes in the Topology tree affect the assignment in CRUSH and CRUSHED. This changes the behavior of those rebalancer strategies to only create levels in the Topology tree for FaultZone and EndNode. This is the only thing required as the topology aware placement should only be done based on FaultZone.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Updated TestInstanceOperation to reproduce issues seen in testing on production like cluster. After topology changes, those tests pass.\r\n- [x] Used current changes to deploy local controller for CRUSHED and WAGED clusters copied from production. Successfully carried out SWAP operation for both.\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nChanges to Topology class are not backwards compatible; however, the rebalancer will have different behavior and  produce new assignment for existing clusters using more than a 2-layer topology. This constitutes bumping minor version and calling out in release notes in next open source release.\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-14T23:49:02Z","updated_at":"2023-12-15T00:28:19Z","closed_at":"2023-12-14T23:49:55Z","merged_at":"2023-12-14T23:49:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"d70a9cbec5e268b7e0a07e69ebb8a5e03c5844a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2713/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2713/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2713/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/799d5a8f7405d1a70349304462ecad2acbd96a0c","head":{"label":"zpinto:zapinto/topology_map_creation_fix","ref":"zapinto/topology_map_creation_fix","sha":"799d5a8f7405d1a70349304462ecad2acbd96a0c","user":{"login":"zpinto","id":20071182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDcxMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20071182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto","html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627637862,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWj-Zg","name":"helix","full_name":"zpinto/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zpinto","id":20071182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDcxMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20071182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto","html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto/helix","description":"Apache

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] Change all rebalancer strategies to create Topology without additional non-FaultZone or EndNode levels of the tree. This will allow for swap to work in clusters where the non-FaultZone or EndNode domain kv pairs don't directly match the swapping node. #2662\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] When attempting to use Swap in clusters that had more complex topologies with levels that were not fault zone or end node, it was discovered that Swap assignment was being computed correctly. This is because the levels and all nodes in the Topology tree affect the assignment in CRUSH and CRUSHED. This changes the behavior of those rebalancer strategies to only create levels in the Topology tree for FaultZone and EndNode. This is the only thing required as the topology aware placement should only be done based on FaultZone.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Updated TestInstanceOperation to reproduce issues seen in testing on production like cluster. After topology changes, those tests pass.\r\n- [x] Used current changes to deploy local controller for CRUSHED and WAGED clusters copied from production. Successfully carried out SWAP operation for both.\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nChanges to Topology class are not backwards compatible; however, the rebalancer will have different behavior and  produce new assignment for existing clusters using more than a 2-layer topology. This constitutes bumping minor version and calling out in release notes in next open source release.\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-13T03:28:47Z","updated_at":"2023-12-13T20:33:01Z","closed_at":"2023-12-13T20:33:01Z","merged_at":"2023-12-13T20:33:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"5d6396e328492304a2f1032a7165ed73ed94f812","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2712/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2712/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2712/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/d1ca2ecd01533c6caed22639e43227383ba5352a","head":{"label":"zpinto:zapinto/topology_map_creation_fix","ref":"zapinto/topology_map_creation_fix","sha":"d1ca2ecd01533c6caed22639e43227383ba5352a","user":{"login":"zpinto","id":20071182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDcxMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20071182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto","html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627637862,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWj-Zg","name":"helix","full_name":"zpinto/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zpinto","id":20071182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDcxMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20071182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto","html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto/helix","description":"Apache

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] not populate SWAP_IN replicas in routing tables until SWAP is completed to avoid spectator serving traffic for replicas on the swapping in instance. #2662\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDuring a swap operation, we are essentially creating a mirror node which is labeled with the SWAP_IN instance operation. Until the point that the swap operation is complete we do not want to serve traffic to this node. To achieve this, the RoutingDataCache will have a notion of routableInstanceConfigs and routableLiveInstances. \r\n\r\nOnly these nodes are used to create the routingTables. At this time, only SWAP_IN instances are considered not to be routable.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Updated the swap tests in TestInstanceOperation to include starting a spectator and validating the EV, CS, and Default routing tables.\r\n\r\nAll TestInstanceOperation tests are passing.\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn this PR we are changing the log level of a critical unrecovered handoff log statement to INFO from DEBUG. This log statement was moved to debug when the TopStateHandoffReportStage was taking longer time. This stage has now been moved to async and the occurences of unrecovered handoffs are very few as high thresholds has been set by our consumers. But, when this threshold gets breached we would like to see this log statement.

Issues\r\n\r\n#2690 [Failed CI Test] testGenericBaseDataAccessorBuilder\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\ntestGenericBaseDataAccessorBuilder makes assertions based on the number of sharedZKClient connections that are open. However, there are 3 connections opened by setClusterConfigAndVerify and not closed. If these connections close during the test run, then the assertion will fail.\r\n\r\nI currently believe this can happen due to Java's garbage collection, specifically if the 3 ConfigAccessors (which no longer have a reference to them) are gc'd near the time the flaky test runs. The test will not fail if gc occurs and connections are closed prior to the test or if gc does not occur until after the test. You can more reliably reproduce this failure by calling system.gc() at the start of the testGenericBaseDataAccessorBuilder method, though it may still pass if gc occurs before the test. \r\n\r\n\r\nExample of connections closing during a test and causing assertion to fail (I added custom log statements)\r\n```\r\nBefore test connection count is: 0\r\nSTART

Issues\r\n\r\nMake logic to determine state of replicas on SWAP_IN instance simpler and more predictable during an in-flight node swap. #2662\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nChanging state assignment logic for replicas on swap in node to only be assigned top state if the state model says that all replicas or all candidate nodes can have the top state. All other cases will have the second top state assigned. Also, moving N and R to constants and updating code where necessary.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- Current tests cover this change.\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#2693 [Failed CI Test] testCacheDataUpdates\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nMetaclient cache utilizes ZK watches to populate its data, this means there can be a lag time between when an operation occurs and when that operation affects the cache. The testCacheDataUpdates was creating a node `zkMetaClientCache.create(key + DATA_PATH, DATA_VALUE)` and then immediately retrieving it `zkMetaClientCache.get(key + DATA_PATH)` . This get() call would actually return null (so data = null) and the subsequent assertion:\r\n`Assert.assertEquals(data, zkMetaClientCache.getDataCacheMap().get(key + DATA_PATH))` would complete as the value had not been populated in the DataCacheMap either and would evaluate to `assertEquals(null, null)`\r\n\r\nThe subsequent test would then fail as we were using the stale `data` value of null when comparing it to the value in the cache. If the cache had been updated, then this assertion would fail. If the cache had not been updated, then the assertion would pass, explaining the flakiness.  \r\n\r\nThe first assertion has been changed to also use the MetaClientTestUtil.verify() method which will repeatedly check until timeout, giving time for the cache to successfully update. \r\nBoth assertions have been changed to expect DATA_VALUE as the znode value, to prevent checking against a possibly stale value. \r\n\r\n---\r\nI was able to **inconsistently** reproduce this test by setting testCacheDataUpdates to be run last by setting its priority =1 (default is 0):\r\n```\r\n    @Test (priority = 1)\r\n    public void testCacheDataUpdates() {\r\n```\r\nMy assumption is that the failure is more likely to occur when the time from the create request being sent to the watch being triggered is increased. The testLargeClusterLoading method sends 1600 create requests to the ZK server, likely putting it under some load. If testCacheDataUpdates occurs afterwards, then maybe the ZK server is and so failure likelihood is increased. \r\n\r\nIf anyone is able to consistently reproduce this, then that would be very helpful. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestCacheDataUpdates\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate

Issues\r\n\r\nWe found that there was significant shuffling occurring when attempting to perform a Node Swap operation on WAGED clusters. #2662\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAfter investigating, it was determined that the cause was due to the PartitionMovementConstraint and BaselineInfluenceConstraint soft constraints improperly scoring AssignableReplicas during the completion of a SWAP.\r\n\r\nThis was because those two soft-constraints were using InstanceName instead of LogicaId to determine if the SWAP_IN node was in the baseline or best possible state. It wouldn't be since the last time that the algorithm produced the baseline and best possible state, it contained the SWAP_OUT node instead. This causes the score to be lower and leads to incorrect assignment.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, those soft-constraints now look for LogicalId and the baseline and best possible state are passed in with instanceName replaced with logicalId.\r\n\r\nAlso, we are putting all of the logic for what instance's are assignable in one place, the BaseControllerDataProvider. We will also add Evacuation here in the future.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nThe previous integration tests have been modified to cover the changes.\r\n\r\nWe have also tested this logic on a production cluster copied to a testing environment.\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\nDespite adding new getters to BaseControllerDataProvider, the old signatures are kept with the same behavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-21T00:54:42Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T19:33:32Z","closed_at":"2023-11-28T19:06:02Z","merged_at":"2023-11-28T19:06:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"310b946fff2ad96340114f73997aa5c5f543bdc0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2702/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2702/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2702/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/8660f2c62730e76c10977bb7c3af9013fb7769a1","head":{"label":"zpinto:zapinto/fix_swap_waged","ref":"zapinto/fix_swap_waged","sha":"8660f2c62730e76c10977bb7c3af9013fb7769a1","user":{"login":"zpinto","id":20071182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDcxMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20071182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto","html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627637862,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWj-Zg","name":"helix","full_name":"zpinto/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zpinto","id":20071182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDcxMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20071182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto","html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto/helix","description":"Apache

\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently, WAGED consider many capacity categories/dimensions such as CPU, Disk, etc for the placement decision evenness scores. In some use case, only one dimension is relevant because the clusters are provisioned based on that category. And, if evenness scores are not based on that then it introduces more shuffle/movements.\r\n\r\nSo, we would like to provide a way for users to specify a prioritized evennessScoringKey that will help computing scores based on that category only.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n1. TestClusterContext \r\n\r\n- testEstimateMaxUtilization\r\n\r\n2. TestMaxCapacityUsageInstanceConstraint\r\n\r\n- testGetNormalizedScoreWithPreferredScoringKey\r\n\r\n3. TestTopStateMaxCapacityUsageInstanceConstraint\r\n\r\n- testGetNormalizedScoreWithPreferredScoringKey\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Reactor Summary for Apache Helix 1.3.2-SNAPSHOT:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Apache Helix .......................................

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n- This PR mainly addresses the recent behavior regression of helix-lock\r\n\r\n(#200 - Link your issue number here: You can write \"Fixes #XXX\". Please use the proper keyword so that the issue gets closed automatically. See https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue\r\nAny of the following keywords can be used: close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, resolved)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n- The incompatibility between old and new helix-lock versions was caused by the last update to helix-lock in Dec 2020, the update is in https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1564 which added priority and notification support to Helix locks.\r\n#### There are two separate regressions in this PR\r\n1. When a lock request is made from the new helix-lock version to a lock path currently locked by the old helix-lock version, what happens is:\r\n* The lock request sees current lock priority is -1 (due to the priority field not present in lock ZNode), which is lower than the priority 0 of the lock being requested. Thus it will try to preempt the current lock owner by writing its own user id, priority and waiting timeout to the requestor fields in the lock ZNode. The lock request pending timeout is set to -1 since the current lock cleanup timeout is -1 (due to the cleanup timeout field not present in lock ZNode). Lock status of the lock request now becomes PENDING.\r\n* The lock request waits on a CountDownLatch for the pending timeout which is -1, therefore the wait immediately returns.\r\nThe current lock owner won’t clean up itself and release the lock since it’s using the old helix-lock version which doesn’t react to lock requests with higher priority.\r\n* Since the lock status of the lock request is still PENDING and the lock request by default is not forceful, an exception is thrown saying “Cleanup has not been finished by lock owner”, which breaks clients' workflow.\r\n2. The non-lock owners is able to `unlock()` a lock if its priority is larger than the priority recorded in the lock. This should be avoided as well. If the non-lock owners want to acquire a lock, it should only call `tryLock()`. \r\n\r\n#### To resolve the two issue discussed above\r\n1. Change the default value of priority from -1 to 0. In this way, a lock request made from new helix-lock version with default priority won't be able to acquire the lock holding by the old helix-lock.\r\n2. Throws exception when `update()` handles a unlock request but the requestor is not the current owner of the lock.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Write a concise description including what, why, how)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n`mvn test -Dtest=TestZKHelixNonblockingLock,TestZKHelixNonblockingLockWithPriority -pl helix-lock`\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 14, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 54.524 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 14, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-lock ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/xiaxgao/IdeaProjects/helix_ps/helix-lock/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Distributed Lock' with 13 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  57.140 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2024-01-29T17:59:36-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

We should ideally cleanup ZK state (remove the message) and allow Helix to continue working on failed task.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nisEvacuateFinished API not available in helix-rest\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nExpose isEvacuateFinished API in helix-rest. setInstanceOperation is already exposed.\r\n\r\nOne key thing to note is the way we return the true/false value. Should we always return a 200 response code if we do not encounter an error? If so, then how do we represent the true/false value? Do we want to send it as json {\"isEvacuateFinished\": \"true\"} or just as a raw \"true\" / \"false\" string? Ideally we should decide on 1 way of returning true/false's and stick to that\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nAdded tests to updateInstance method in testPerInstanceAccessor.java\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n$  mvn test -o -Dtest=TestPerInstanceAccessor -pl=helix-rest\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 24, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 52.578 s - in org.apache.helix.rest.server.TestPerInstanceAccessor\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 24, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-rest ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/gspencer/Desktop/git-repos/helix/helix-rest/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Restful Interface' with 92 classes\r\n[WARNING] Classes in bundle 'Apache Helix :: Restful Interface' do not match with execution data.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-07T00:20:05Z","updated_at":"2023-11-14T08:05:35Z","closed_at":"2023-11-14T08:05:34Z","merged_at":"2023-11-14T08:05:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"75c5521696216b4c416359275cf80b8b35ea5898","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2694/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2694/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2694/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/6188fd47a258fe2256b2c84cb6e21af3ddfd3e69","head":{"label":"GrantPSpencer:evacuate-finished-api","ref":"evacuate-finished-api","sha":"6188fd47a258fe2256b2c84cb6e21af3ddfd3e69","user":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":645914891,"node_id":"R_kgDOJn_hCw","name":"helix","full_name":"GrantPSpencer/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer/helix","description":"Fork

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix condition to check if DOMAIN has all required TOPOLOGY keys and allows for extra kv pairs, to reduce noisy logs.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen DOMAIN has more kv pairs than the ones required in TOPOLOGY(non-WAGED cases only), we log an incorrect warn message. When there are extra kv pairs, this check to see if numOfMatchedKeys == domainAsMap.size() is false because not all keys in DOMAIN are used.\r\n \r\nThis leads to huge log flooding. The check above is incorrect, as it should be okay to have extra kv pairs in DOMAIN as long as the required kv pairs exist. The check should be (numOfMatchedKeys < clusterTopologyConfig.getTopologyKeyDefaultValue().size()), so it only warns if DOMAIN does not contain the required topology keys.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nCurrent tests should cover this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n- Add support to filter out evacuating nodes during stoppable checks:\r\n  - `siblingNodesActiveReplicaCheck`\r\n  - `perPartitionHealthCheck`\r\n- Provision the users with the capability to blacklist a subset of stoppable checks so that Helix will only perform the rest of stoppable checks.\r\n\r\n* Notes\r\n  * We don't need to filtering out \"SWAP_IN\"

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes apache#2667\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis fix changes the flaky assertions of the tests in the class org.apache.helix.rest.server.TestPerInstanceAccessor#testGetAllMessages. \r\nSets return the elements in a non-deterministic order, which means that this assertion is not correct, because it checks whether the collections contain the same elements in the same order (this was changed in the [library](https://github.com/testng-team/testng/issues/2643)). This leads to a flaky test. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/blob/bd1d28c52126c27bbc3a3c156a18bee13f8079c4/helix-rest/src/test/java/org/apache/helix/rest/server/TestPerInstanceAccessor.java#L329-L330\r\n\r\nTo fix this problem, the assertion has been rewritten to check if the collections contain the same amount of elements as well as both collections contain all values of the other collection.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/blob/e0b1834240542994e00ec512ddc6f844f1deea43/helix-rest/src/test/java/org/apache/helix/rest/server/TestPerInstanceAccessor.java#L328-L332\r\n\r\nThe flaky test has been found by using the [NonDex](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/edu.illinois/nondex-maven-plugin) tool – to reproduce run\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nmvn -pl helix-rest edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.helix.rest.server.TestPerInstanceAccessor -DnondexSeed=933178\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nNo test have been written – one existing test has been updated.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n[INFO]
