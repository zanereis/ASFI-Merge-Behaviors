When using such an expression in native queries, the user will get the corresponding value without any error. In SQL, however, the user will run into `NumberFormatException` because we convert the double to big-decimal while constructing a literal numeric expression. This probably should be fixed in calcite - see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-2067.

Description\r\nThis PR adds support for using MariaDB java connector (and by extension database) using the Druid MySQL metadata extension, as well as JDBC connection string uri validation for lookups and SQL ingestion.\r\n\r\nFor the metadata connector, a new config, `druid.metadata.mysql.driver.driverClassName` has been added, which can be set to `org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver` for example to allow use of the MariaDB Connector/J. \r\n\r\nI got a bit carried away, and now JDBC connection string uri validation for all supported databases has been moved into `druid-core` and is performed with reflection, so the logic is no longer duplicated across the lookup JDBC handling and SQL firehose logic and is instead centralized in `ConnectionUriUtils`.\r\n\r\nThe Docker integration tests have been modified to accept an additional environment variable, `MYSQL_DRIVER_CLASSNAME`, and setting it to `org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver` will kick the test container into a mode where they load the mariadb connector jar instead of mysql jar and use that instead. I duplicated the 'query' integration test to run against mariadb, which at least gives coverage of the metadata connector, but I have tested jdbc lookups and sql ingestion manually as well to ensure that the property validation stuff is functional.\r\n\r\nIt looked like there are a handful of documentation changes that should be made, which I will address in a follow-up PR if that is acceptable to reviewers.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the code related to segment loading specifically SegmentLoader and SegmentLoaderLocalCacheManager. SegmentLoader is marked `UnstableAPI` which means, it can be extended outside core druid in custom extensions. Here is a summary of changes\r\n\r\n- `SegmentLoader` returns an instance of `ReferenceCountingSegment` instead of `Segment`. Earlier, `SegmentManager` was wrapping `Segment` objects inside `ReferenceCountingSegment`. That is now moved to `SegmentLoader`. With this, a custom implementation can track the references of segments. It also allows them to create custom `ReferenceCountingSegment` implementations. For this reason, the constructor visibility in `ReferenceCountingSegment` is changed from `private` to `protected`. \r\n- `SegmentCacheManager` has two additional methods called - `reserve(DataSegment)` and `release(DataSegment)`. These methods let the caller reserve or release space without calling `SegmentLoader#getSegment`. We already had similar methods in `StorageLocation` and now they are available in `SegmentCacheManager` too which wraps multiple locations.\r\n- Refactoring to simplify the code in `SegmentCacheManager` wherever possible. There is no change in the functionality. \r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SegmentLoader`\r\n * `SegmentLoaderLocalCacheManager`\r\n * `StorageLocation`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

For example: -->\r\n\r\nAdd the plumbing for a new query metric, `query/segments/count` that is not emitted by default. The value of this metric is the number of segments that a query will touch. My team has found it as an easy way to do analytics on the reach of queries running on our multi-tenant clusters. You could get this information via query metrics that are related to individual segments, but this is a more concise way to retrieve the information. My team has clusters with millions of segments and have made the decision to forgo segment level metric emission due to the cost. I assume other large clusters would feel the same about having these metrics without having the segment level metrics in their feeds. This new metric was especially helpful as we worked on identifying what we should use as a segment threshold for priority reduction on our clusters.\r\n\r\nAn open question is how to document non-emitted metrics so people know the plumbing is there if they want to emit them.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe metric is disabled by default. I made this decision because there are discussions in the past that advocate for not adding default metrics to the code base. One of the main arguments for this strategy is that new metrics increase volume and increased volume will increase costs incurred by cluster operators. This can be very real dollar figures when it comes to cloud deployments paying for message queues and druid storage/compute. Therefore, enabling the metric requires either patching the code in DefaultQueryMetrics or Overriding QueryMetrics in their own fork.\r\n\r\nHere is the discussion regarding query metric emission by default: [link](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6559)\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n* `QueryMetrics`\r\n* `CachingClusteredClient`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the code for `QueryRunnerFactory#mergeRunners` to accept a new interface called `QueryProcessingPool`  instead of `ExecutorService` for concurrent execution of query runners. This interface will let custom extensions inject their own implementation for deciding which query-runner to prioritize first. The default implementation is the same as today that takes the priority of query into account. `QueryProcessingPool` can also be used as a regular executor service. It has a dedicated method for accepting query execution work so implementations can differentiate between regular async tasks and query execution tasks. This dedicated method also passes the `QueryRunner` object as part of the task information. This hook will let custom extensions carry any state from `QuerySegmentWalker` to `QueryProcessingPool#mergeRunners` which is not possible currently. \r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `QueryProcessingPool`\r\n * `QueryRunnerFactory`\r\n * `ForwardingQueryProcessingPool`\r\n * `DirectQueryProcessingPool`\r\n * `PrioritizedQueryRunnerCallable`\r\n * `AbstractPrioritizedQueryRunnerCallable`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nI noticed that `timestamp_floor(\"__time\",'P1D',null,'Asia/Shanghai')` is extremely  slower(_**more than 3x in my case**_) than `timestamp_floor(\"__time\",'P1D','','Asia/Shanghai')` when I test this sql\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect\r\n sum(\"count\") as c,\r\n Floor(__time to DAY) as __time\r\nfrom\r\n \"sms_normal\"\r\nwhere\r\n __time >= TIMESTAMP '2021-05-19 00:00:00'\r\n and __time < TIMESTAMP '2021-05-20 23:59:59'\r\ngroup by\r\n Floor(__time to DAY)\r\nhaving\r\n c>0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is due to \r\n```java\r\n    if (args.stream().skip(1).allMatch(Expr::isLiteral)) {\r\n      return new TimestampFloorExpr(args);\r\n    } else {\r\n      return new TimestampFloorDynamicExpr(args);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nin `TimestampFloorExprMacro.java`\r\n\r\nThe \"null\" expr doesn't match `Expr::isLiteral()`, then TimestampFloorDynamicExpr is used, and `TimestampFloorDynamicExpr.eval()` create PeriodGranularity every time not like that only one time in `TimestampFloorExpr`'s constructor.\r\n```java\r\n    public ExprEval eval(final ObjectBinding bindings)\r\n    {\r\n      final PeriodGranularity granularity = computeGranularity(args, bindings);\r\n      return ExprEval.of(granularity.bucketStart(args.get(0).eval(bindings).asLong()));\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch modifies the translation to `timestamp_floor(\"__time\",'P1D','','Asia/Shanghai')` rather than `timestamp_floor(\"__time\",'P1D',null,'Asia/Shanghai')`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n *

[#9351](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9351) described, DynamicConfigProvider should replace PasswordProvider. PasswordProvider has an implementation named EnvironmentVariablePasswordProvider, which allow users to read config from environment variable.

multiple segments. The exception comes out because Jedis, current redis driver used by `redis-cache` extension, DOES NOT support MGET operation among different redis nodes. This is NOT a constraint of redis cluster, but an implementation limit imposed by Jedis.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply implements a widely used workaround: grouping keys by pre-calculated redis slot to ensure keys in one group maps to a same redis node , and then MGET keys one group by group. \r\n\r\nA better way is to use Lettuce driver to replace Jedis, MGET on redis cluster is supported natively by Lettuce. But since this is a community extension, I don't think it's worthy of refactoring this extension from its core right now.\r\n\r\n### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n- Implementation of `AbstractRedisCache#getBulk` is pushed down to `RedisClusterCache#mgetFromRedis` and `RedisStandaloneCache#mgetFromRedis`.\r\n\r\n- In `RedisClusterCache#mgetFromRedis`, it first groups keys by their slots and then executes MGET command one group by group.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [X] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

bug in auto compaction needsCompaction method that can skip segments incorrectly\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIn needsCompaction method, when the configured indexSpec (in auto compaction) is different from the one of segments or the configured partitionsSpec  (in auto compaction) is different from the partitionsSpec of segments, the segments will need compaction. However, if the segments was also previously compacted without segmentGranularity and the configured segmentGranularity  (in auto compaction) is the same as the segments current segmentGranularity, then we would incorrectly set needsCompaction back to be false.\r\n \r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR introduces two changes to how Druid services are started within the Docker image.\r\n\r\nThe first changes the behavior of environment variables defined using the `druid_` prefix style.\r\nPreviously these settings were disregarded when using a config file specified using `DRUID_CONFIG_${service}`, in effect they were ignored.\r\nWith this change environment variables when combined with `DRUID_CONFIG_${service}` will override the settings in the config file.\r\n\r\nThe second influences how runtime JVM configuration is calculated when using the Docker image.\r\nPrior to this change settings in a services `jvm.config` were specified after`JAVA_OPTS` on the Java command line when starting the service.\r\nThis meant that when a  flag is present in both `jvm.config` and `JAVA_OPTS` the setting from `jvm.config` would take precedence, this change reverses this relationship with `JAVA_OPTS` now being specified after flags sourced from `jvm.config`","created_at":"2021-06-13T21:58:49Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:41:35Z","closed_at":"2021-10-08T21:05:38Z","merged_at":"2021-10-08T21:05:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"989297edc37e31814d817686f306b8aa2bd76861","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where expressions which depend on some external state which is also typically encoded into a cache key, such as a lookup, can have the incorrect cache key because the expression was only taking into account the string form of the expression. This causes incorrect results if the underlying lookup has changed, as the cache key did not encode this information and so remains unchanged, despite that the expression would result in a different value with the newer lookup.\r\n\r\nThis has been resolved by making `Expr` extend `Cacheable` and providing a default `getCacheKey` implementation which uses the stringified form, but is overridden by the lookup expression to form a composite key of the stringified expression and the lookup extraction functions cache key.\r\n\r\nI moved `CacheKeyBuilder` from `druid-processing` to `druid-core`, which was marked with `@PublicApi`, so tagging with release notes (`Cacheable` was already defined in `druid-core`).\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-10T23:43:02Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T09:16:11Z","closed_at":"2021-06-15T00:26:43Z","merged_at":"2021-06-15T00:26:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"920aa414ca5eab60149239f448891afd01b736ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nThere are some ES6 features, such as `Proxy`, that would make sense to use in various parts of the web console. Unfortunately, many of these cannot be polyfilled and therefore cannot be used in older browsers like IE11.\r\n\r\nSince IE11 will be officially retired in about 1 year and its rendering engine still exists inside of the new Edge for those who need it, there is no compelling reason to continue supporting it in the web console. Dropping IE and other browsers that lack ES6 support will both slim down the JS payload and allow us to use new ES features that have ostensibly been available for a few years in the majority of browsers.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changes\r\n * Consolidate and update `browserslist` declaration to include only those browsers that support ES6\r\n * Update TypeScript compilation target to `es2016`\r\n * Add a banner to `unified-console.html` if an unsupported browser is detected (using existence of `Proxy` as a rough indicator of support)\r\n * Replace `HotkeysTarget` usage (deprecated) with `useHotkeys` to avoid runtime error caused by dependence on ES5-style class behavior\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nMakes #11331 more true by making SQL queries ignore `bySegment` in the query context, which is incompatible with the SQL result format (and probably SQL in general) and will cause an explosion when it tries to convert the response format.\r\n\r\nAlso added a test for `SqlLifecycle` state transitions while I was here, to cover the happy path and make sure state transitions happen as expected. This stuff was all pretty well indirectly tested, but didn't have an actual test of its own.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for

additional structures for references, bytes, and characters;\nfastutil.jar the remaining structures.

Description\r\n\r\nThis is a minor improvement in Kafka ingestion. \r\n\r\nKafkaConsumer.poll always returns an instance of list, we don't need to instantiate an object by ourselves. \r\nSince this function could be called very frequently during ingestion, this improvement could save object allocation and garbage collection.\r\n\r\nFor Kinesis ingestion, there's no such problem.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any

Description\r\n\r\n`IndexedInts` returned by `DimensionSelector.getRow()` should be decodable using `DimensionSelector.lookupName()` as long as the cursor points at the same row. `PredicateFilteredDimensionSelector` breaks this contract, which leads to incorrect query result when filtering multi-valued columns in incremental index using

Background\r\n\r\n#10203 introduces a human readable way to configure values of some byte-related properties. In that PR, two different standard unit systems are supported: [decimal format and binary format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix). \r\n\r\nThe former one is a unit system based on powers of 10(also known as SI format), while the latter one is based on powers of 2(also knowns as IEC format). For example, 1KB = 1000 bytes while 1KiB = 1024 bytes.\r\n\r\nBut in old days, KB/MB/GB are also used to express values based on power of 2, which causes ambiguities. If there's an a word `64MB`, it's hard to tell whether it is `64 * 1000 * 100 * 1000` or `64 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024`.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR tidies up all KB/MB/GB usages in the doc and javadoc to use the right unit system based on the code. \r\nAfter this PR, **all KB/MB/GB in the doc/javadoc are decimal format**.  And all the doc/javadoc in the future should use the right unit system. \r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, for the disk size/file size/segment size, decimal format is used, while for other values, binary format is applied.\r\n\r\nTo help review, I added some comments which linked the change to the code so that it's much easier for us to know the default value in current code.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes the return type inference of several SQL operators which were incorrectly reporting their return type as not nullable, when in fact this was dependent on the arguments to the operator. A new method, `returnTypeCascadeNullable`, has been added to `OperatorConversions` builder type, which allows defining operators with a return type that is only nullable if any of the operands are nullable, which is many of them. I only evaluated all callers of `returnTypeNonNull`, and didn't look closely if some of the `returnTypeNullable` should be switched to this new method.\r\n\r\nList of impacted functions:\r\n* `ARRAY_LENGTH`/`MV_LENGTH`\r\n* `ARRAY_OFFSET_OF`/`MV_OFFSET_OF`\r\n* `ARRAY_ORDINAL_OF`/`MV_ORDINAL_OF`\r\n* `ARRAY_TO_STRING`/`MV_TO_STRING`\r\n* `BTRIM`\r\n* `DATE_TRUNC`\r\n* `LPAD`\r\n* `LTRIM`\r\n* `LEFT`\r\n* `MILLIS_TO_TIMESTAMP`\r\n* `PARSE_LONG`\r\n* `RPAD`\r\n* `RTRIM`\r\n* `REPEAT`\r\n* `REVERSE`\r\n* `RIGHT`\r\n* `STRPOS`\r\n* `TEXTCAT`\r\n* `TIME_CEIL`\r\n* `TIME_EXTRACT`\r\n* `TIME_FLOOR`\r\n* `TIME_FORMAT`\r\n* `TIME_SHIFT`\r\n* `TIMESTAMP_TO_MILLIS`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis fixes bugs like in the test case added to `CalciteQueryTests`, which covers some of the functions which have been fixed and illustrates the fix (since these operators were previously marked as non-null, the count aggregator would be effectively translated to `count(*)`). I am unsure of what other bugs might have been happening besides this, but it is quite possible this PR fixes a handful of other issues with null handing in SQL compatible mode since some inappropriate optimizations might have been happening.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, I also fixed null handling bugs in `repeat` which would've had a null pointer exception, and `timestamp_shift` which would ignore numeric nulls in SQL compatible mode and just shift.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-03T11:18:47Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T09:16:41Z","closed_at":"2021-06-15T19:26:59Z","merged_at":"2021-06-15T19:26:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"bfbd7ec4329b4f083e1c2044b847a04b9f8912cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nWhen you try a new Druid API or new parameters, the error message can lack details and one has to start a debugging session to find a line that produces an exception. For example, this message doesn't say what parameter produced NullPointerException (line 15 here doesn't say where the error happened in source code):\r\n```\r\n{\"error\":\"Cannot construct instance of `org.apache.druid.indexing.input.GeneratorInputSource`, problem: `java.lang.NullPointerException`\\n at [Source: (org.eclipse.jetty.server.HttpInputOverHTTP); line: 15, column: 9] (through reference chain: org.apache.druid.indexing.common.task.batch.parallel.ParallelIndexSupervisorTask[\\\"spec\\\"]->org.apache.druid.indexing.common.task.batch.parallel.ParallelIndexIngestionSpec[\\\"ioConfig\\\"]->org.apache.druid.indexing.common.task.batch.parallel.ParallelIndexIOConfig[\\\"inputSource\\\"])\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis logging writes a stacktrace to the logfile, it can be conveniently set up in configuration to log in production or not, besides the logging can be dynamically altered using JMX console too.\r\n\r\nI've also added error logging to InputSourceSampler.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

fixes a bug which caused hadoop based ingestion tasks to fail whenever the deep storage directory has a character that is not permitted in hdfs. This caused by the deep storage segment file path being returned without the scheme (s3, gcs, etc). Hadoop client uses the scheme to determine the FileSystem class implementation to use when performing file operations. If no scheme is set, it default to hdfs file. Fixed the issue by returning the full uri of the segment file, which includes the scheme.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

bug 502 bad gateway thrown when we edit/delete any auto compaction config created 0.21.0 or before\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is a bug introduced by https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11144\r\n\r\nThis issue will only happen if user has one or more auto compaction configuration created in a version before latest (0.21.0 or earlier) then upgrade to latest (0.22.0 or later). If this was the case, once user upgraded to 0.22.0 or later,\r\n- The user will not be able to add, edited or deleted any auto-compaction configuration (for both old datasource created prior to upgrade and new datasources created after the upgrade). \r\n- The user will also not be able to change auto compaction task ratio and max task slot.\r\n- Existing auto compactions created prior to the upgrade will still run and create compaction tasks as expected \r\n\r\nThis happen because when you have a auto compaction created in 0.21.0 or earlier,\r\nthe spec stored in db will be something like\r\n`{\"compactionConfigs\":[{\"dataSource\":\"wikipedia\",\"taskPriority\":25,\"inputSegmentSizeBytes\":419430400,\"maxRowsPerSegment\":null,\"skipOffsetFromLatest\":\"P1D\",\"tuningConfig\":{\"maxRowsInMemory\":null,\"maxBytesInMemory\":null,\"maxTotalRows\":null,\"splitHintSpec\":null,\"partitionsSpec\":{\"type\":\"hashed\",\"numShards\":null,\"partitionDimensions\":[],\"partitionFunction\":\"murmur3_32_abs\",\"maxRowsPerSegment\":5000000},\"indexSpec\":null,\"indexSpecForIntermediatePersists\":null,\"maxPendingPersists\":null,\"pushTimeout\":null,\"segmentWriteOutMediumFactory\":null,\"maxNumConcurrentSubTasks\":null,\"maxRetry\":null,\"taskStatusCheckPeriodMs\":null,\"chatHandlerTimeout\":null,\"chatHandlerNumRetries\":null,\"maxNumSegmentsToMerge\":null,\"totalNumMergeTasks\":null,\"forceGuaranteedRollup\":true,\"type\":\"index_parallel\"},\"taskContext\":null}],\"compactionTaskSlotRatio\":0.1,\"maxCompactionTaskSlots\":2147483647}`.\r\nNotice that this compaction config does not have some of the newer fields like granularitySpec and ioConfig that was added in 0.22.0. In latest (0.22.0). When we update the auto compaction config, we read the current config from the database and deserialize it into Java object (CoordinatorCompactionConfig).When we try to write the update to the db, we do a compareAndSwap (added in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11144) which make sure that `current` config we read earlier from the db and deserialize in Java Object converted to byte is still the same as what is in the db. \r\nHowever, the current config have the new fields (added when it was deserialize to Java CoordinatorCompactionConfig class (although those new fields are set to null) and hence it doesn’t match what is in the db anymore. This causes any update to auto compaction config to consistently fail. \r\n\r\nThis PR modify CoordinatorCompactionConfigsResource and KillCompactionConfig (which use compareAndSwap to update the Compaction config) to read the raw bytes payload directly from the db (instead of using the ConfigHolder in ConfigManager). We would then store the raw bytes of the config in a local variable before deserialize into CoordinatorCompactionConfig. Finally, when we call compareAndSwap to update the compaction config, we would use the stored raw bytes as the old value for the purpose of comparing with db current value.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

From the historical process's perspective, it operates on a byte array of the segment index file by providing some offset and length. The operating system is responsible for making sure the offset referenced in the byte array is the RAM, if it's not, it will trigger a **major** page fault to load the page or a serious of pages containing the data into RAM, which is a costly disk operation; on the other hand, if the offset referenced in the byte array is already in RAM, it may reside in the disk cache (or page cache which is a synonym) part of the RAM, then a **minor** page fault is triggered to link the page in the page cache to the page of the virtual memory of Druid, which is a much light operation and doesn't involve disk read. Because of the way OS manages the page cache, if a segment file is traversed by the read system call by any process (even non Druid processes), OS will load it into page cache part of the RAM if there's still space left so that later read system call to the segment file can just trigger a minor page fault. For latency use cases, we want minimal disk reads during query time, so we can leverage this mechanism to read segment files when they are first downloaded into local disk of historical hosts as a way to populate page cache beforehand so that we hope even the first query to a segment is fast when the first query actually comes.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Other setups with a smaller RAM to disk ratio are left to undefined behavior (won't crash but just not the best performance as the intention of the PR).\r\n\r\nWhen the total segment size on local disk is larger than the page cache usable in the RAM, a lot of complications will happen and many of them are out of application's control so this PR tries to avoid this use case:\r\n1) Page cache management is at the discretion of operating system so the OS may evict any existing segments already in page cache based on whatever policy it holds (LRU, LFU, etc.). From the application perspective, we can only assume any segment may be evicted when the page cache is full.\r\n2) If we make it configurable to load only certain data sources into page cache, let's say the host is hosting data source X and Y and only X is configured to load into page cache, unless data source Y is completely not queried, we can't prevent Y from polluting the page cache used by X because when Y is queried, the portion of the bytes needed to complete the query in the segment index file will be mmaped and has to be loaded into page cache by OS and some segments of X in the page cache will have to be evicted first if the page cache is full. A better design to address different data source's need in my opinion is to configure different server pools for X and Y where for a latency sensitive data source X, put it in a cluster of 1 to 1 mapping of available page cache RAM to segment size and enable this feature; for a non latency sensitive data source Y, put it in another cluster of historical nodes of smaller page cache RAM to disk ratio and disable this feature so on demand page in and page out during mmap is performed. Although the user can still choose to enable this feature for Y but it just won't be as effective.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR trades availability off performance, so the whole loading segments into page cache is done in a thread pool asynchronously to not delay historical process startup and to not impact data readiness for query ETA when available for download.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\n\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

an issue where a compaction spec, reflected back from Druid, with hashed partitioning will not validate in the compaction dialog. This is due to the fact that `maxRowsPerSegment` was renamed to `targetRowsPerSegment` but when Druid sends back the compaction config with `targetRowsPerSegment` becomes `maxRowsPerSegment`. As a result `maxRowsPerSegment` is not fully deprecated and must still be surfaced in the form for correct validation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above this PR also makes the following fixes:\r\n- It is now possible to add a hidden field to the AutoForm. This means it can be validated correctly but will not surface in the form. This is needed for when `targetRowsPerSegment` will fully replace `maxRowsPerSegment` as we will still need to declare `maxRowsPerSegment` (as hidden) for the validation to work well with old configs that still use `maxRowsPerSegment`.\r\n- The `Submit` button will now be disabled if there is an erroneous JSON state in JSON inputs. Preventing the user from being able to paste an invalid JSON and hit submit (submitting the default config).\r\n- `Date` serialization was fixed in CSV/TSV download\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-26T20:25:01Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T08:53:27Z","closed_at":"2021-05-27T23:36:42Z","merged_at":"2021-05-27T23:36:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"31c811d8946180e7d89c9b4c9ab8357938798f3b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1251906357,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUxOTA2MzU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Web%20Console","name":"Area

The PR doesn't add choices to pick other compressed bitmaps like Concise Bitmap because we don't see clear performance benefits to add other implementations at the moment.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the implementation of Roaring bitmap, there are 3 implementations available in the Roaring bitmap library: `MutableRoaringBitmap`, `ImmutableRoaringBitmap` and `RoaringBitmap`. `RoaringBitmap` is supposed to be more performant than the other two in this case because it doesn't need to maintain a byte buffer backend and byte buffer backend is only convenient if we need to do Mmap or if there's serde involved, which is the case for batch ingested immutable segments querying. However, the implementation in the PR tries reusing the logic in the current Java classes built for the batch ingested immutable segments, so the byte buffer backed implementation `MutableRoaringBitmap` is used to store row indexes for each new rows. During query time, a snapshot of the bitmap is needed so `MutableRoaringBitmap` is cast to `ImmutableRoaringBitmap`, which involves copying at one of the stages of the conversion. During the copy, for high cardinality dimensions, the number of row indexes for a given row value should be small so the copying overhead should be minimal; for low cardinality dimensions, supposedly there are more data to copy than the previous case, though we don't see obvious issue during testing and we can add metrics on the copying time and as long as the benefit outweigh the no bitmap full scan case, it should still be worthwhile.\r\n\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n\r\nEnable in memory bitmap construction in supervisor spec\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"kafka\",\r\n  \"tuningConfig\": {\r\n    ...\r\n    \"enableInMemoryBitmap\": true\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n\r\n The implementation tries piggybacking on the bitmap query related classes of batch generated immutable segment index (QueryableIndex and its support classes) as much as possible to reduce duplicate work.\r\n\r\n### Benchmark\r\n\r\n#### Production Cluster Benchmark\r\n\r\n<img width=\"631\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-08-24 at 5 10 07 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8614743/130705911-fb6d749b-07f2-400b-ac5d-419209f164c4.png\">\r\nFigure 1: Production cluster use case 1 P99 latency reduction on Middle Managers.

We added a temporary query time flag `useInMemoryBitmapInQuery` that can control whether to use the in-memory bitmap index during query time even though the in-memory bitmap index is already created during ingestion (this flag is removed in the PR created because it doesn't serve any purpose other than validation during development). We stopped the Kafka producer temporarily and left some records in memory in the incremental index (~852,000 records, when reaching 1M, persistence will trigger) before persistence triggered to verify that the results are the same when `useInMemoryBitmapInQuery` is set to true or false.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"371\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-08-24 at 5 29 39 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8614743/130707097-084c4dbf-775c-490f-9e3e-a8bb7b91424a.png\">\r\nFigure 4: Number of events ingested on Middle Managers for verification data source.

Column `advertiserid` has in-memory bitmap index created.\r\nSELECT __time, SUM(spend)/1000000.00 as spend, sum(paid_events) as paid_events, sum(cnt) as cnt, sum(cnt_gross) as cnt_gross FROM verification_data_source WHERE advertiserid = '123' and __time >= timestamp'2021-07-20 20:00:00' group by __time\r\n\r\nQuery 3: filter on one of top 10 large advertisers. Column `advertiserid` and column `apptype` have in-memory bitmap index created.\r\nSELECT __time, SUM(spend)/1000000.00 as spend, sum(paid_events) as paid_events, sum(cnt) as cnt, sum(cnt_gross) as cnt_gross FROM verification_data_source WHERE advertiserid = '123' and apptype = 3 and __time >= timestamp'2021-07-20 20:00:00' GROUP BY __time ORDER BY __time\r\n\r\nQuery 4: filter on one of top 10 small advertiser. Column `advertiserid` and column `apptype` have in-memory bitmap index created.\r\nSELECT __time, SUM(spend)/1000000.00 as spend, sum(paid_events) as paid_events, sum(cnt) as cnt, sum(cnt_gross) as cnt_gross FROM verification_data_source WHERE advertiserid = '123' and __time >= timestamp'2021-07-20 20:00:00' GROUP BY __time ORDER BY __time\r\n```\r\nWe verified that non empty results are return and they are the same whether `useInMemoryBitmapInQuery` is set to true or false for all the above queries.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n -->\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

#11278 , #11298 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTo fix 11278, `mv` instruction is used to replace original `ln` instruction to eliminate symlink so that the docker image works with AWS Fargate. This change has been verified with the help of @mattmassicotte , reporter of that issue.\r\n\r\nTo fix 11298, `/opt/shared` is created in the Dockerfile so that a named volume could be used in the docker-compose. And a named volume `druid_shared` is used to share segments and task log files among Druid services\r\n\r\nBecause the problems we have encountered are platform independent, I test these changes on 3 different platform following the steps below\r\n\r\n### Test Steps\r\n1. Execute command `docker volume prune` to clean up previous volumes \r\n2. Launch the example docker-compose\r\n3. Start an ingestion task | Task Successes\r\n4. Task successes\r\n\r\n### Test Result\r\n| Host OS | Host OS Version | Docker Versoin | Test Result |\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n| CentOS | 7.2.1511 | 20.10.6 | OK |\r\n| Ubuntu | 20.04.2 | 20.10.2 | OK |\r\n| macOS | 11.3 | 3.3.1 | OK |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

In our production system, a case like this:\r\nFor `SeekableStreamSupervisor#checkTaskDuration()`, if the following code timeout happens, then pausing tasks in taskClient were still running.\r\n`List<Map<PartitionIdType, SequenceOffsetType>> results = Futures.successfulAsList(futures).get(futureTimeoutInSeconds, TimeUnit.SECONDS);`\r\nBut finally the pausing task finished normally, the groupId will not be moved from `activelyReadingTaskGroups` to `pendingCompletionTaskGroups`, because the code block after above code will not be executed.\r\n\r\n2. Then next round `checkTaskDuration()` executed when the task has been PUBLISHING, \"Can't pause exception\" thrown.\r\n\r\n3. Furthermore, if the wild pausing task executed in thread pool for long time, the bad result is unknown. So if `checkTaskDuraion()` reaches to end whether normally or abnormally, all pausing tasks should be finished.\r\n\r\n4. If one taskGroup failed, those successful taskGroups will be affected. \r\n\r\n5. Solution\r\n* In `SeekableStreamIndexTaskClient`, add some code to manage the pausing task request, can submit and stop task.\r\n* In `SeekableStreamSupervisor`, If `checkTaskDuraion()` reaches to end, taskClient can ensure that all the pausing task requests are finished.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

SeeableStreamIndexSupervisor\r\n[Method organization and design]\r\n* Add a single method `moveGroupFromReadingToPending()` for each finished pausing task.\r\n* Add finally block in `checkTaskDuration()`, that ensures taskClient can control all the running tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n[No]\r\n\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n[No]\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Issue https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/11231\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nRefactor segment creation (and merge) phase of `Appenderator` for batch ingestion in such a way to decouple from streaming data structures and making memory growth bounded regardless of input file size. This PR are the changes to\r\nimplement the proposal [Minimize memory utilization in Sinks/Hydrants for native batch ingestion](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/11231).\r\n\r\nThe main changes were to separate `AppenderatorImpl` into `StreamAppenderator` (which is `AppenderatorImpl` unchanged) and `BatchAppenderator`. The latter is were the persistence of `Sink` and `Firehydrant` as described in the [proposal](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/11231) is implemented. The rest of the changes were in associated interfaces and client code to mainly make the concurrency in the appenderator synchronous. The batch appenderator requires that push, persist, merge be synchronous in order to facilitate the handling of `Sink` and `Firehydrant` when they are persisted and restored. As the proposal indicates, future work is suggested to remove the concurrent APIs from `BatchAppenderator` (i.e any API that returns a `ListenableFuture` or a `Future`). \r\n\r\nOne area that we did not explore was to look into the  memory mapping behavior impact when maxColumnsToMerge is set. This is also for future work.\r\n\r\n### Feature flag\r\nThe middle manager (i.e. Peon) configuration flag `druid.indexer.task.useLegacyBatchProcessing` when set to true will default to the older, known to be working code path. This is to have a fall back in place just in case there is some issue with the code in the PR after it is merged. We will remove this flag in the future. The default for this flag, `false`, is to use the new code (i.e. do not memory map `Firehydrant` indices as well as persist and clear from memory --but not from disk--  all `Sink` and `Firehydrant` at each intermediate persist )\r\n\r\n\r\n### Future work\r\n#### Refactor `Appenderator` interface \r\nSee proposal for more about this\r\n\r\n#### Study impact when `maxColumnsToMerge` is set\r\nThis setting also impacts the memory mapping of `Firehydrant`. Even though the references of the mappings are only \r\nkept in local variables that can be garbage collected we should look into it at some point.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [X ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

in protobuf can be of types other than String such as `google.protobuf.Timestamp`. It's best to fall back to the old logic of deserializing the timestamp via Json than directly calling `toString()` on `timestamp` object. The latter can return an unparseable string e.g. calling `toString()` on `google.protobuf.Timestamp` will return `\"seconds: X, nanos: Y\"`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

In our production system, a case like this:\r\nFor `org.apache.druid.indexing.seekablestream.supervisor.SeekableStreamSupervisor#checkTaskDuration()`, if the following code timeout happens, then pausing tasks in taskClient were still running. \r\n`List<Map<PartitionIdType, SequenceOffsetType>> results = Futures.successfulAsList(futures).get(futureTimeoutInSeconds, TimeUnit.SECONDS);`\r\n\r\nBut finally the pausing task finished normally, the groupId will not be moved from `activelyReadingTaskGroups` to `pendingCompletionTaskGroups`, because the code block after above code will not be executed.\r\n\r\nThen next round `checkTaskDuration()` executed when the task has been PUBLISHING, \"Can't pause exception\" thrown.\r\n\r\n2. Furthermore, if the wild pausing task executed in thread pool for long time, the bad result is unknown. So if `checkTaskDuraion()` reaches to end whether normally or abnormally, all pausing tasks should be finished.\r\n\r\n3. Solution\r\n1) In `SeekableStreamIndexTaskClient`, add some code to manage the pausing tasks, can submit and stop task.\r\n2) In `SeekableStreamSupervisor`, If `checkTaskDuraion()` reaches to end, `taskClient` can ensure that all the pausing tasks are finished.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n1. SeeableStreamIndexTaskClient\r\n[Class organization and design]\r\n1) Add a class `PauseCallable`, implements from Callable,  to wrap the pausing task feature and provide `stop()` to trigger the pausing task can be finished.\r\n2) Move `pause()` from `class SeeableStreamIndexTaskClient` to `class PauseCallable`\r\n\r\n2. SeeableStreamIndexSupervisor\r\n[Method organization and design]\r\n1) Add a single method `moveGroupFromReadingToPending()` for each finished pausing task.\r\n2) Add finally block in `checkTaskDuration()`, that ensures taskClient can control all the running tasks.\r\n\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n[No]\r\n\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n[No]\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Rename directory from `helm` to `helm/druid`. \r\n- It should place a folder named `druid` under `helm` folder to do **helm package**, just like https://github.com/apache/superset/tree/master/helm/superset\r\n#### Migrate helm chart from helm v2 to v3\r\n- change `apiVersion` from `v1` to `v2`\r\n- migrate dependencies to Chart.yaml\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

#11238 to a branch on the apache repo so I can run more tests before we merge.\r\n\r\n>Initial attempt at making travis be a bit more selective about what it runs, since every change takes like.. over a day of compute time. \r\n\r\n>This PR adds a new script, `check-test-suite.py`, which is used in `.travis.yml` jobs to check whether or not a given job should run. It does this based on an admittedly primitive git diff file path prefix matching against stuff hard coded into the script, initially dividing into 3 categories: 'docs', 'web-console' and like, everything else. We do some similar stuff for code coverage diff checking enforcement for java projects, so a follow-up improvement could provide finer granularity for the 'everything else' bucket.\r\n\r\n>I'm sure there is a better way to configure this than hard coding stuff into the script as well, but, its a start and should let us at least cut down a tiny amount of the global warming we are surely causing with all of this CI.\r\n\r\n>I think the only thing that is questionable is considering changes to `.travis.yml` skippable, which will result in newly added configurations of existing tests not getting triggered I think, but maybe that isn't a common situation? Also, I have the license checks and packaging checks running always, because they seem like useful sanity checks to make sure all license stuff is cool and that a distribution can be built from

Description\r\nBuilds on top of #11104 and #10605 to add bitwise aggregator functions:\r\n\r\n|Function|Notes|Default|\r\n|--------|-----|-------|\r\n|`BIT_AND(expr)`|Performs a bitwise AND operation on all input values.|`null` if `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=false`, otherwise `0`|\r\n|`BIT_OR(expr)`|Performs a bitwise OR operation on all input values.|`null` if `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=false`, otherwise `0`|\r\n|`BIT_XOR(expr)`|Performs a bitwise XOR operation on all input values.|`null` if `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=false`, otherwise `0`|\r\n\r\nIn the process of adding this, I've also modified `ExpressionLambdaAggregatorFactory` to have an additional JSON property, \r\n`initiallyNull`, which determines if the aggregator will produce a `null` value or `initialValue`/`initialCombineValue`. For example, an SQL compatible count aggregator would have `initiallyNull` set to `false` and have `initialValue` set to `0`, so that it would always return 0 even if no rows were aggregated, while a sum would have it set to `true` so that it would return `null` in the same case. For the buffer aggregator, this is tracked by setting a bit in the expression type byte which prefixes all of the serialized expressions, which is then cleared whenever the aggregate function is called. This change simplifies `ARRAY_AGG` since it was previously using a finalize expression to coerce empty results back to null, but now it can just naturally be initialized to null.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests

work around to make moving average query through router.\r\n Hi, @FrankChen021. As I mentioned in #11262, add an empty implementation of QuerySegmentWalker in CliRouter.java can make moving average query through router(just load this extension in broker and router). We use it on production for months. I don't think it very suitable for make same change in community version, because this change only for a contribution extension and it is wired to add an empty implementation. I hope it can help you. If you think my way is suitable, I will change my code following your advice. And if you have other good idea, you can open another PR. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR is easiest viewed in split! (imo).\r\n\r\nFixes #11140 (the task view only).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSee #11140.\r\n\r\nThis PR unlocks concurrency and improves performance of the `HeapMemoryTaskStorage` task storage component.\r\n\r\nThe patch introduces two key changes:\r\n1. Replace `giant.lock` with (a) a ConcurrentHashMap for the task list queries and (b) synchronized blocks for remaining task audit log and task locks.\r\n2. Simplify algorithm for getting tasks (as used by overlord /tasks API) so that tasks are filtered _before_ they are sorted, and limited _before_ they are materialized. As screenshots in #11140 show this results in big improvements on our services.\r\n\r\n### Design decisions\r\n\r\n- I did note that both task locks and task audits are (mostly) distinct APIs, sharing only the task ID and the task removal function. It is possible to also make these lock-free, however in the interest of minimizing surface area of change I opted not to do this.\r\n- Part of the reason for this is that it is possible to create audit logs and lock entries for tasks that do not exist in the tasks list. I am not sure if this is intended so I opted to retain existing behaviour. Alternatively, if this is not intended, and locks / logs can only exist for previously created tasks, then I would bring the locks & logs into the ConcurrentHashMap which would allow elimination of all locking.\r\n- I did look at creating a ReaderWriterLock to replace the existing giant lock, however in our internal reviews the code was actually less clear to read than a simpler lock-free implementation.\r\n\r\n- I opted for a slight reorder of `getLocks` and `removeTasksOlderThan` since it keeps their related locks map codepaths closer in the file. I could have left this but I find it easier to keep the same synchronized sections on the same page.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md)\r\n      - see below!\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Key questions\r\n\r\n- Would appreciate input on testing scope\r\n    - what/ specific additional concurrency tests would be desired. OverlordTest?\r\n    - It seems like from the `diff-test-coverage` report that I'd be well served by adding tests to cover items such as whether the comparator works or filter/map rules that were not previously covered.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue with expression evaluation for array value bindings when input is provided by JSON deserialized values (rather than parsing a constant or provided by a column for example), such as when results are being merged on a broker.\r\n\r\nThe main issue is that an empty array result from a historical is later deserialized from JSON into an empty ArrayList, which `ExprEval.coerceListToArray` converts into `Object[0]`, but `ExprEval.bestEffortOf` is unable to handle this. This PR fixes the issue by treating this empty list as an empty string array (since string array is the default in the other cases of this method, as strings are traditionally the more flexible type in druid)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code

#10799 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a ClassCastException in broker when issuing a moving average query. This exception appears after changes made in #10082  since 0.19.\r\n\r\nIn 10082, `REMAINING_RESPONSES_FROM_QUERY_SERVERS` is added to `ResponseContext` as a hash map\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/3be8e29269f0865798840312a8475f9c2db7d0a7/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/client/DirectDruidClient.java#L121\r\n\r\nAnd when a query is executed, the right server num is added to this hash map.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/3be8e29269f0865798840312a8475f9c2db7d0a7/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/client/CachingClusteredClient.java#L217-L220\r\n\r\nWhile for moving average query, it constructs a new ResponseContext object by itself and of course does not initialize such hash map object, when executing the code above, it triggers the exception.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the code in moving average by copying all objects in response context from caller to the response object it creates so that all initialization for response context won't be missed for such query.\r\n\r\nFor testing, it's better to add an integration test for this bug. Currently there's no IT integrated for community contributed extensions, I don't add the test but test this change on my computer.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in the Druid SQL planner where a query with an offset would incorrectly try to plan to a timeseries query, (which does not support offset), effectively ignoring it which could lead to an infinite loop in the planner rewriting the Sort of a query such as this example, which has been added to the tests:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT r0.c, r1.c\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT COUNT(*) AS c\r\n  FROM \"foo\"\r\n  GROUP BY ()\r\n  OFFSET 1\r\n) AS r0\r\nLEFT JOIN (\r\n  SELECT COUNT(*) AS c\r\n  FROM \"foo\"\r\n  GROUP BY ()\r\n) AS r1 ON TRUE\r\nLIMIT 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the timeseries query construction during planning was only checking that offset was not present if there was at least one grouping dimension (when it should've always been checking this), so simply moving this check outside of an 'if' statement resolves the issue.\r\n\r\nCredit to @vogievetsky for finding this :+1:\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.
