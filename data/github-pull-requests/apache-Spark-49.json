If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis changes the initialization of `SparkEnv.memoryManager` to after the `DriverPlugin` is loaded, to allow the plugin to customize memory related configurations.\r\n\r\nA minor fix has been made to `Task` to make sure that it uses the same `BlockManager` through out the task execution. Previous a different `BlockManager` could be used in some corner cases. Also added a test for the fix.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nToday, there is no way for a custom `DriverPlugin` to override memory configurations such as `spark.executor.memory`, `spark.executor.memoryOverhead`, `spark.memory.offheap.size` etc This is because the memory manager is initialized before `DriverPlugin` is loaded.\r\n\r\nA similar change has been made to `shuffleManager` in #43627.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for processing/event time based timers with `transformWithState` operator\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nChanges are required to add event-driven timer based support for stateful streaming applications based on arbitrary state  API with the `transformWithState` operator\r\n\r\nAs part of this change - we introduce a bunch of functions that users can use within the `StatefulProcessor` logic. Using the `StatefulProcessorHandle`, users can do the following:\r\n- register timer at a given timestamp\r\n- delete timer at a given timestamp\r\n- list timers \r\n\r\nNote that all the above operations are tied to the implicit grouping key.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the implementation, we make use of additional column families to support the operations mentioned above. For registered timers, we maintain a primary index (as a col family) that keeps the mapping between the grouping key and expiry timestamp. This col family is used to add and delete timers with direct access to the key and also for listing registered timers for a given grouping key using `prefix scan`. We also maintain a secondary index that inverts the ordering of the timestamp and grouping key. We will incorporate the use of the range scan encoder for this col family in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nFew additional constraints:\r\n- only registered timers are tracked and occupy storage (locally and remotely)\r\n- col families starting with `_` are reserved and cannot be used as state variables\r\n- timers are checkpointed as before\r\n- users have to provide a `timeoutMode` to the operator. Currently, they can choose to not register timeouts or register timeouts that are processing-time based or event-time based. However, this mode has to be declared upfront within the operator arguments.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests as well as pseudo-integration tests\r\n\r\nStatefulProcessorHandleSuite\r\n```\r\n13:58:42.463 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.state.StatefulProcessorHandleSuite:\r\n\r\n=====

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR propose to improve concurrency performance for `SparkSession`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, `SparkSession` adopted the mutable.Map caching the config infos. The `SparkSession` guarded by this so as ensure security under multithreading.\r\nBecause all the operation about config are not related to other operation, we can delegate security to `ConcurrentHashMap`.\r\n`ConcurrentHashMap`  has higher concurrency activity and responsiveness.\r\nAfter this change, `SparkSession` have better perf than before.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n'No'.\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-06T11:10:57Z","updated_at":"2024-06-15T00:19:54Z","closed_at":"2024-06-15T00:19:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8c9d1e9a605b4948ece0af9f34254078e8b51a75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45046/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45046/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45046/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/526e15250b634a1fa8f34efd9dfd60d7a835cb36","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-46989","ref":"SPARK-46989","sha":"526e15250b634a1fa8f34efd9dfd60d7a835cb36","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHive metastore API uses unquoted element names for struct types, so the spark catalyst generates a catalog string to conform with.\r\n\r\nFor example, both `struct<x:int,y.z:int>` and `struct<x:int,y.z:int>` are valid cases in `FieldSchema`.\r\nwhile the original form of the 2nd one, which is from user API, is ```struct<x:int,`y.z`:int>```. Because we use `CatalystSqlParser.parseDataType` to verify the type, we need to convert the unquoted element names to quoted ones.\r\n\r\n- For verification\r\n  - For the read path, a.k.a, getting an existing table from HMS. We need to convert `struct<x:int,y.z:int>` returned by HMS to ```struct<x:int,`y.z`:int>```.\r\n  - For the write path, a.k.a, creating/altering a table to HMS. We need to convert `struct<x:int,y.z:int>` generated by Spark catalogString to ```struct<x:int,`y.z`:int>```.\r\n- For HMS API calls\r\n   - keep the `struct<x:int,y.z:int>` AS-IS to conform with HMS, as ```'`'``` can not be recognized by hive.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for specifying key and value encoder separately and also for each col family in RocksDB state store provider\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change allows us to specify encoder for key/values separately and avoid encoding additional bytes. Also, it allows us to set schemas/encoders for individual column families, which will be required for future changes related to transformWithState operator (listState/timer changes etc)\r\n\r\nWe are refactoring a bit here given the upcoming changes. so we are proposing to split key and value encoders. \r\nKey encoders can be of 2 types:\r\n- with prefix scan\r\n- without prefix scan\r\n\r\nValue encoders can also eventually be of 2 types:\r\n- single value\r\n- multiple values (used for list state)\r\n\r\nAnd we now also allow setting schema and getting encoder for each column family.\r\nSo after the change, we can potentially allow something like this:\r\n- col family 1 - with keySchema with prefix scan and valueSchema with single value and binary type\r\n- col family 2 - with keySchema without prefix scan and valueSchema with multiple values\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests\r\n```\r\n[info]

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange `OpenHashSet` to use object equality instead of cooperative equality when looking up keys.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis brings the behavior of `OpenHashSet` more in line with the semantics of `java.util.HashSet`, and fixes its behavior when comparing values for which `equals` and `==` return different results, like 0.0/-0.0 and NaN/NaN.\r\n\r\nFor example, in certain cases where both 0.0 and -0.0 are provided as keys to the set, lookups of one or the other key may return the [wrong position][wrong] in the set. This leads to the bug described in SPARK-45599 and summarized in [this comment][1].\r\n\r\n[wrong]: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45036/files#diff-894198a5fea34e5b7f07d0a4641eb09995315d5de3e0fded3743c15a3c8af405R277-R283\r\n[1]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-45599?focusedCommentId=17806954&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-17806954\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it resolves the bug described in SPARK-45599.\r\n\r\n`OpenHashSet` is used widely under the hood, including in:\r\n- `OpenHashMap`, which itself backs:\r\n    - `TypedImperativeAggregate`\r\n    - aggregate functions like `percentile` and `mode`\r\n    - many algorithms in ML and MLlib\r\n- `SQLOpenHashSet`, which backs array functions like `array_union` and `array_distinct`\r\n\r\nHowever, the user-facing changes should be limited to the kind of edge case described in SPARK-45599.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew and existing unit tests. Of the new tests added in this PR, some simply validate that we have not changed existing SQL semantics, while others confirm that we have fixed the specific bug reported in SPARK-45599 along with any related incorrect behavior.\r\n\r\nNew tests failing on `master` but passing on this branch:\r\n- [Handling 0.0 and -0.0 in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace all `IllegalArgumentException` by `SparkIllegalArgumentException` in `Catalyst` code base, and introduce new legacy error classes with the `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_` prefix.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo unify Spark SQL exception, and port Java exceptions on Spark exceptions with error classes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it can if user's code assumes some particular format of `IllegalArgumentException` messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running existing test suites like:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *BufferHolderSparkSubmitSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-02-05T19:30:26Z","updated_at":"2024-03-04T01:22:57Z","closed_at":"2024-02-11T23:25:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"794111137bf3eb3f6855309c127b7a7f96b15d4a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45033/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45033/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45033/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e2a9da8344df8d6115dba3ffd1e9156896c66225","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:migrate-IllegalArgumentException-catalyst","ref":"migrate-IllegalArgumentException-catalyst","sha":"e2a9da8344df8d6115dba3ffd1e9156896c66225","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/receive

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nOne more followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44876 .\r\n\r\nPreviously, by using a fake analyzer, session variables can't be resolved and thus can't be in the default value expression. Now we use the actual analyzer and optimizer, session variables can be properly resolved and replaced with literals at the end. This is not expected as default value shouldn't references temporary things.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by explicitly failing the check if default value references session variables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLet's say we are going to access 3 HDFS, `nn-1`, `nn-2`, `nn-3` in YARN cluster mode with TGT cache, while the `nn-1` is the `defaultFs` which is used by YARN to store aggregated logs, and there are issues in `nn-2` which can not issue the token.\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-submit \\\r\n  --master yarn \\\r\n  --deployMode cluster \\\r\n  --conf spark.kerberos.access.hadoopFileSystems=hdfs://nn-1,hdfs://nn-2,hdfs://nn-3 \\\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring the submitting phase, Spark is going to call `HadoopFSDelegationTokenProvider` to fetch tokens from all declared NameNodes one by one, in **indeterminate** order (`HadoopFSDelegationTokenProvider.hadoopFSsToAccess` process and return a `Set[FileSystem]`), so the order may not respect the user declared order in `spark.kerberos.access.hadoopFileSystems`.\r\n\r\nIf the order is [`nn-1`, `nn-2`, `nn-3`], then we are going to request a token from `nn-1` successfully, but fail for `nn-2` with the below error, the left `nn-3` is going to be skipped. But such failure WON'T block the whole submitting process, the Spark app is going to be submitted with only `nn-1` token.\r\n```\r\n2024-01-03 12:41:36 [WARN] [main] org.apache.spark.deploy.security.HadoopFSDelegationTokenProvider#94 - Failed to get token from service hadoopfs\r\norg.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException: <Some Error Message>\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client.getRpcResponse(Client.java:1507) ~[hadoop-common-2.9.2.2.jar:?]\r\n  ...\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DistributedFileSystem.addDelegationTokens(DistributedFileSystem.java:2604) ~[hadoop-hdfs-client-2.9.2.2.jar:?]\r\n  at org.apache.spark.deploy.security.HadoopFSDelegationTokenProvider.$anonfun$fetchDelegationTokens$1(HadoopFSDelegationTokenProvider.scala:122) ~[spark-core_2.12-3.3.1.27.jar:3.3.1.27]\r\n  at scala.collection.immutable.HashSet$HashSet1.foreach(HashSet.scala:335) ~[scala-library-2.12.15.jar:?]\r\n  at scala.collection.immutable.HashSet$HashTrieSet.foreach(HashSet.scala:1111) ~[scala-library-2.12.15.jar:?]\r\n  at scala.collection.immutable.HashSet$HashTrieSet.foreach(HashSet.scala:1111) ~[scala-library-2.12.15.jar:?]\r\n  at org.apache.spark.deploy.security.HadoopFSDelegationTokenProvider.fetchDelegationTokens(HadoopFSDelegationTokenProvider.scala:115) ~[spark-core_2.12-3.3.1.27.jar:3.3.1.27]\r\n  ...\r\n  at org.apache.spark.deploy.security.HadoopDelegationTokenManager.obtainDelegationTokens(HadoopDelegationTokenManager.scala:146) ~[spark-core_2.12-3.3.1.27.jar:3.3.1.27]\r\n  at org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.Client.setupSecurityToken(Client.scala:352) ~[spark-yarn_2.12-3.3.1.27.jar:3.3.1.27]\r\n  at org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.Client.createContainerLaunchContext(Client.scala:1140) ~[spark-yarn_2.12-3.3.1.27.jar:3.3.1.27]\r\n  ...\r\n  at org.apache.spark.deploy.SparkSubmit.main(SparkSubmit.scala) ~[spark-core_2.12-3.3.1.27.jar:3.3.1.27]\r\n```\r\nwhen the Spark app access `nn-2` and `nn-3`, it will fail with `o.a.h.security.AccessControlException: Client cannot authenticate via:[TOKEN, KERBEROS]`\r\n\r\nThings become worse if the FS order is [`nn-3`, `nn-2`, `nn-1`], the Spark app will be submitted to YARN with only `nn-3` token, it even has no chance to allow NodeManager to upload aggregated logs after the application exit because it requires the app to provide a token to access `nn-1`.\r\n\r\nthe log from NodeManager\r\n```\r\n2024-01-03 08:08:14,028 [3173570620] - WARN [NM ContainerManager dispatcher:Client$Connection1$772] - Exception encountered while connecting to the server\r\nCaused by: org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException: Client cannot authenticate via:[TOKEN, KERBEROS]\r\n    at org.apache.hadoop.security.SaslRpcClient.selectSaslClient(SaslRpcClient.java:179)\r\n    at org.apache.hadoop.security.SaslRpcClient.saslConnect(SaslRpcClient.java:392)\r\n    ...\r\n    at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DistributedFileSystem.getFileStatus(DistributedFileSystem.java:1768)\r\n    ...\r\n    at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.containermanager.logaggregation.LogAggregationService.createAppDir(LogAggregationService.java:404)\r\n    at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.containermanager.logaggregation.LogAggregationService.initAppAggregator(LogAggregationService.java:273)\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the logs, we even don't know what happened.\r\n\r\nEventually, due to the **indeterminate** order of NameNodes to request tokens, such a Job sometimes submitted successfully and sometimes failed without logs.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1903\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/26535726/7ca5c871-6399-4eae-b689-d6d741c1c373\">\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, when the user configures `spark.kerberos.access.hadoopFileSystems` to access multiple Kerberized HDFS, and one or more NameNodes have issues, tokens are always fetched from the rest health NameNodes after this patch.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nProvide examples showing what type literals like `123.456` and `123.456E0` have in SQL.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn Python (and I think Java too) fractional numeric literals are typically floats. To get decimals, you need to provide an explicit postfix or use an explicit class. In Spark, it's the other way around. I found this surprising and couldn't find documentation about it.\r\n\r\nI discovered this after reading [SPARK-45786](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-45786). I did a little searching and came across https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10796, which shows that we used to default to floats as the fractional numeric literal, but then switched to decimals.\r\n\r\nThere is an additional wrinkle I discovered in #45003. If the fractional literal has an exponent, then it's a double, not a decimal.\r\n\r\nThe existing syntax documents this, but that alone is not user-friendly. The new examples make this clearer.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it clarifies the user-facing documentation about fractional numeric literals.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNo testing.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-02-05T07:25:17Z","updated_at":"2024-02-06T04:48:58Z","closed_at":"2024-02-06T04:46:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"091d716423f8faaac35dedc7b72c1084e8cf95e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45027/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45027/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45027/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/de52df5b2ed5afc077297fd5a0a100ec238fe3ec","head":{"label":"nchammas:fractional-literal-take2","ref":"fractional-literal-take2","sha":"de52df5b2ed5afc077297fd5a0a100ec238fe3ec","user":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23797421,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc5NzQyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"nchammas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch adds output/exception string to the error message when output schema not match expected schema in `TPCDSQueryTestSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe have used `TPCDSQueryTestSuite` for testing TPCDS query results. The test suite checks output schema and then output result. If any exception happens during query execution, it will handle the exception and return an empty schema and exception class + message as output. So, when any exception happens, the test suite just fails on schema check and never uses/shows the exception, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.Exception: Expected \"struct<[count(1):bigint]>\", but got \"struct<[]>\" Schema did not match\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe cannot see what exception was happened there from the log. It is somehow inconvenient for debugging.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, test only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-05T06:09:17Z","updated_at":"2024-02-05T18:10:26Z","closed_at":"2024-02-05T17:43:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b74d511d8489e0d2e86292d761a6d55750c7680b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45025/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45025/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45025/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5707cf517ea36028b7c02464a006a09542e6177e","head":{"label":"viirya:minor_ouput_exception","ref":"minor_ouput_exception","sha":"5707cf517ea36028b7c02464a006a09542e6177e","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

Create a PythonMicrobatchStream to invoke RPC function call. This happens in the spark driver. For each python streaming data source instance there will be a long live python worker process created. Inside the python process, the python streaming reader will receive function call and parameter from JVM PythonMicroBatchStream and send back result through socket.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn preparation for support of development of streaming data source in Python.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test. PythonMicroBatchStream plan offset and partitions by invoking function call through socket correctly and handle error correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-04T21:24:21Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T03:35:23Z","closed_at":"2024-03-12T03:35:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1e612f46eb1cad79247d211020dc236a739fcd80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n=== Applying Rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.RewriteGetJsonObject ===\r\n!Project [get_json_object(a#0, $.c1) AS c1#3, get_json_object(a#0, $.c2) AS c2#4, get_json_object(b#1, $.c1) AS c3#5, get_json_object(b#1, $.c2) AS c4#6, get_json_object(c#2, $.c1) AS c5#7]   Project [c1#13 AS c1#3, c2#14 AS c2#4, c1#15 AS c3#5, c2#16 AS c4#6, get_json_object(c#2, $.c1) AS c5#7]\r\n!+- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#0, b#1, c#2]                                                                                                                                                      +- Generate json_tuple(b#1, c1, c2), false, b, [c1#15, c2#16]\r\n!                                                                                                                                                                                                  +- Generate json_tuple(a#0, c1, c2), false, a, [c1#13, c2#14]\r\n!                                                                                                                                                                                                     +- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#0, b#1, c#2]\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note that it needs to rewrite the path, otherwise it will not get the correct value. For example:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql (default)> SELECT get_json_object('{\"name\": \"alice\", \"age\": 5}', '$.name') AS name;\r\nalice\r\nspark-sql (default)> SELECT name lateral view json_tuple('{\"name\": \"alice\", \"age\": 5}', '$.name') a AS name;\r\nNULL\r\nspark-sql (default)> select name lateral view json_tuple('{\"name\": \"alice\", \"age\": 5}', 'name') a AS name;\r\nalice\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nImprove query performance by eliminating multiple-time expensive JSON parsing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nA new configuration `spark.sql.optimizer.rewriteGetJsonObjectToJsonTupleThreshold` is introduced, while the default value `None` keeps the current behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to \r\n- fix potential bug(ie: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44208) and enhance user experience.\r\n- make the code more compliant with standards\r\n\r\nBackport above to branch 3.5.\r\nMaster branch pr: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44343\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe use the local maven repo as the first-level cache in ivy.  The original intention was to reduce the time required to parse and obtain the ar, but when there are corrupted files in the local maven repo,The above mechanism will be directly interrupted and the prompt is very unfriendly, which will greatly confuse the user.  Based on the original intention, we should skip the cache directly in similar situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to hide `Thread Dump` and `Heap Histogram` links of `Dead` executors in Spark Driver `Executors` UI.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n![Screenshot 2024-02-02 at 11 40 46 PM](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/9700541/9fb45667-b25c-44cc-9c7c-c2ff981c5a2f)\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n![Screenshot 2024-02-02 at 11

live JVM, those links are broken and leads to the following pages.\r\n\r\n**Broken Thread Dump Link**\r\n![Screenshot 2024-02-02 at 11 36

tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-02-03T07:35:10Z","updated_at":"2024-02-04T03:18:37Z","closed_at":"2024-02-04T03:17:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4db0dcb74e4fcad5b076740070e2e9a26b9a5f33","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExplain that a number like `123.456`, without a postfix but with a decimal point, is a decimal literal.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn Python (and I think Java too) fractional numeric literals are typically floats. To get decimals, you need to provide an explicit postfix or use an explicit class.\r\n\r\nIn Spark, it's the other way around. I found this surprising and couldn't find documentation about it.\r\n\r\nI discovered this after reading SPARK-45786. I did a little searching and came across #10796, which shows that we used to default to floats as the fractional numeric literal, but then switched to decimals.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds a bit of documentation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNo testing.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-02-02T17:33:11Z","updated_at":"2024-02-05T06:53:38Z","closed_at":"2024-02-05T05:56:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da38d695172c7786a6e8609bb40fbac1ecc80426","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45003/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45003/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45003/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eb33c95571b3433137a941ade6cf9aa3b13025f0","head":{"label":"nchammas:decimal-literal","ref":"decimal-literal","sha":"eb33c95571b3433137a941ade6cf9aa3b13025f0","user":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23797421,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc5NzQyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"nchammas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe proposed changes in this pr involve refactoring the method of creating a `Hasher[T]` instance in the code. The original code used a series of if-else statements to check the class type of `T` and create the corresponding `Hasher[T]` instance. The proposed change simplifies this process by using Scala's pattern matching feature. The new code is more concise and easier to read.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes are needed for several reasons. Firstly, the use of pattern matching makes the code more idiomatic to Scala, which is beneficial for readability and maintainability. Secondly, the original code contains a comment about a bug in the Scala 2.9.x compiler that prevented the use of pattern matching in this context. However, Apache Spark 4.0 has switched to using Scala 2.13, and the new code has passed all tests, it appears that the bug no longer exists in the new version of Scala. Lastly, the change reduces the amount of code and makes it cleaner and easier to understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current signature of the `hllInvalidLgK` query execution error takes four arguments:\r\n1. The SQL function (a string).\r\n2. The minimum possible `lgk` value (an integer).\r\n3. The maximum possible `lgk` value (an integer).\r\n4. The actual invalid `lgk` value (a string).\r\n\r\nThere is no meaningful reason for the 4th argument to be a string. In this PR we change it to be an integer, just like the minimum and maximum valid values.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSeeking to make the signature of the `hllInvalidLgK` error more meaningful and self-consistent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, there is no user-facing changes because of this PR. This is just an internal change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests suffice.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-02-02T06:13:54Z","updated_at":"2024-02-02T19:55:25Z","closed_at":"2024-02-02T19:55:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"057130ac72b3fba400e6ac6c5bf7500b827ae3e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44995/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44995/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44995/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cfc4a47edf8401883d011ae864469a8e37194c81","head":{"label":"mkaravel:hll-invalid-lgk-error-arg","ref":"hll-invalid-lgk-error-arg","sha":"cfc4a47edf8401883d011ae864469a8e37194c81","user":{"login":"mkaravel","id":6397014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTcwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6397014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel","html_url":"https://github.com/mkaravel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":408710293,"node_id":"R_kgDOGFxslQ","name":"spark","full_name":"mkaravel/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mkaravel","id":6397014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTcwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6397014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel","html_url":"https://github.com/mkaravel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mkaravel/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to align `not available codec` error-class, includes:\r\n- In `core`, convert `CODEC_NOT_AVAILABLE` to `CODEC_NOT_AVAILABLE.WITH_CONF_SUGGESTION`.\r\n- In `sql`, use `CODEC_NOT_AVAILABLE.WITH_AVAILABLE_CODECS_SUGGESTION` to cover `IllegalArgumentException`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen I was solving a case where `the compression option` is `null`, as follows:\r\n<img width=\"1423\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/0e2abdad-0c1c-4ade-9f48-014bc4372fc6\">\r\nI found that we could first complete the extraction logic for `the codec error`. At the same time, I found that there was already an `CODEC_NOT_AVAILABLE` error in the `error-classes.json`, but it had some differences from the error prompt in `SQL` for compress. Therefore, I proposed using `CODEC_NOT_AVAILABLE` as `a parent class error` and adding `two subclass errors`: `WITH_AVAILABLE_CODECS_SUGGESTION` and `WITH_CONF_SUGGESTION`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Update existed UT.\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe have issues resolving column definitions with default values, i.e., `c CHAR(5) DEFAULT 'foo'`, `v  VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'bar'`. The reason is that CAHR/VARCHAR types in schemas are not supplanted with STRING type to align with the value expression.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes these issues in `ResolveDefaultColumns`, which seems to only cover the v1 tables. When I applied some related tests to v2 tables, they had the same issues. But beyond that, there are some other front-loading needs to be addressed. In this case, I'd like to separate v2 from the v1 PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nbugfix\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-sql (default)> CREATE TABLE t( c CHAR(5) DEFAULT 'spark') USING parquet;\r\n[INVALID_DEFAULT_VALUE.DATA_TYPE] Failed to execute CREATE TABLE command because the destination table column `c` has a DEFAULT value 'spark', which requires \"CHAR(5)\" type, but the statement provided a value of incompatible \"STRING\" type.\r\n```\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno, bugfix\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn the new operator for arbitrary state-v2, we cannot rely on the session/encoder being available since the initialization for the various state instances happens on the executors. Also, we can only support limited state types with the available encoders. Hence, for the state serialization, we propose to serialize primitives/case classes/POJO into avro bytes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese changes are needed for providing a dedicated serializer for state-v2. Leveraging avro can speed up the serialization and comes with native support for schema evolution. \r\nThe changes are part of the work around adding new stateful streaming operator for arbitrary state mgmt that provides a bunch of new features listed in the SPIP JIRA here - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-45939\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nTODO: depends on whether we want to ask users for value encoders.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests for primitives, case classes, POJO separately.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR extends `DynamicPruningSubquery` to support broadcasting of multiple filtering keys (instead of one as before). The majority of the PR is to simply generalise singularity to plurality.\r\n\r\n**Note:** We actually do not use the multiple filtering keys `DynamicPruningSubquery` in this PR, we are doing this to make supporting DPP Null Safe Equality or multiple Equality predicates easier in the future.\r\n\r\nIn Null Safe Equality JOIN, the JOIN condition `a <=> b` is transformed to `Coalesce(key1, Literal(key1.dataType)) = Coalesce(key2, Literal(key2.dataType)) AND IsNull(key1) = IsNull(key2)`. In order to have the highest pruning efficiency, we broadcast the 2 keys `Coalesce(key, Literal(key.dataType))` and `IsNull(key)` and use them to prune the other side at the same time. \r\n\r\nBefore, the `DynamicPruningSubquery` only has one broadcasting key and we only supports DPP for one `EqualTo` JOIN predicate, now we are extending the subquery to multiple broadcasting keys. Please note that DPP has not been supported for multiple JOIN predicates. \r\n\r\nPut it in another way, at the moment, we don't insert a DPP Filter for multiple JOIN predicates at the same time, only potentially insert a DPP Filter for a given Equality JOIN predicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make supporting DPP Null Safe Equality or DPP multiple Equality predicates easier in the future.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13723 , conf --num-executors will be used to compute initialExecutors and initial # of executors.\r\n\r\nI think that may conflict to DYN_ALLOCATION_MIN_EXECUTORS and will not free the idle executors.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  private def removeExecutors(executors: Seq[(String, Int)]): Seq[String] = synchronized {\r\n        if (newExecutorTotal - 1 < minNumExecutors) {\r\n          logDebug(s\"Not removing idle executor $executorIdToBeRemoved because there \" +\r\n

Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nLocal test.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n```\r\n24/01/27 02:41:20 INFO Utils: Using initial

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR simplifies the `getSerializationProxy` function in the `IndylambdaScalaClosures`. The main change is to remove the `isClosureCandidate` check when determining if a class is a closure because Apache Spark 4.0 no longer support Scala 2.11.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe reason for removing the `isClosureCandidate` check is that in Scala 2.12 and later versions, closures are implemented as synthetic classes generated by the Java LambdaMetafactory. These synthetic classes do not need to implement the `scala.Function` interface, which is what the `isClosureCandidate` check was originally checking for. Therefore, the `isClosureCandidate` check is not necessary for identifying closures in Scala 2.12 and later versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPush down throwable predicate through aggregates and add ut for \"can't push down nondeterministic filter through aggregate\".\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf we can push down a filter through Aggregate, it means the filter only references the grouping keys. The Aggregate operator can't reduce grouping keys so the filter won't see any new data after pushing down. So push down throwable filter through aggregate does not affect exception thrown. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nConsolidate all error documentation into a single page of error states and conditions. Each condition and sub-condition will have a link anchor that allows for direct references.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsql-error-conditions.html#cannot-update-field\r\nsql-error-conditions.html#cannot-update-field-array-type\r\nsql-error-conditions.html#cannot-update-field-interval-type\r\nsql-error-conditions.html#cannot-update-field-map-type\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe table is styled to make it easier to read:\r\n- Sub-conditions are indented relative to their parent condition.\r\n- Long condition names like `UDTF_INVALID_ALIAS_IN_REQUESTED_ORDERING_STRING_FROM_ANALYZE_METHOD` wrap in a visually pleasing manner, _without_ interfering with how search engines will index those names or preventing users from copy-pasting the whole name as they would normally.\r\n\r\nThe new documentation is generated dynamically via `docs/util/build-error-docs.py` as part of the documentation build. No generated files will be tracked in git.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] Figure out what, if anything, we will do about the links we are breaking by deleting the old error pages.\r\n- [x] Make sure we are using the correct terminology once SPARK-46810 is resolved.\r\n- [x] Add opening prose for the main error conditions page.\r\n- [x] Update the main Jekyll build to generate the new documentation on the fly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current error documentation has several problems that make it difficult to maintain and difficult to use:\r\n\r\n1. The current documentation consists of many Markdown files that are both programmatically generated and checked in to git. This combination leads to problems like the checked in files getting out of sync with the source they are generated from, and leads to unnecessary code churn and problems like the one that precipitated #44847.\r\n2. The individual pages like `docs/sql-error-conditions-cannot-load-state-store-error-class.md` are sparse and don't add much value as standalone pages. They also clutter the top-level namespace. There are around 60 of these individual pages, one for each error condition that has sub-conditions.\r\n\r\n    The number of pages to manage leads to other, more subtle problems as well. Though there are 60 individual pages, only 22 of them are captured in `docs/_data/menu-sql.yaml`.\r\n3. The current process to generate this documentation is awkward. We are using a) a Spark Scala test that requires b) a special environment variable to be set so that c) we read some JSON, in order to d) generate Markdown files, which in turn e) get compiled into HTML.\r\n\r\n    Fundamentally, we are just generating HTML from JSON. It seems inappropriate to couple this process to the Spark build.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it overhauls the error documentation. Unless we add redirects, several links that work against the Spark 3.5 documentation will no longer work against the Spark 4.0 documentation.\r\n\r\nOne developer-facing change included in this PR is that the main documentation build with Jekyll now depends on our Python development environment. This is in order to generate the error documentation, since that depends on our ability to render Markdown. Previously, only the SQL and Python API docs depended on the Python environment.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI built the docs and reviewed the results in my browser.\r\n\r\n<img

This could become difficult to change for complex schemas. \r\n\r\nThe solution is to add a new option `stableIdentifierPrefixForUnionType` which defaults to `member_` and allows users to configure whatever prefix they require, e.g. `member`, `tmp_`, or even an empty string.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAllows to customise the prefix of stable ids in Avro without the need to rename all of the columns which could be cumbersome for complex schemas.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. The PR adds a new option in Avro: `stableIdentifierPrefixForUnionType`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds changes for ListState implementation in State Api v2. As a list contains multiple values for a single key, we utilize RocksDB merge operator to persist multiple values.\r\n\r\nChanges include\r\n\r\n1. A new encoder/decoder to encode multiple values inside a single byte[] array (stored in RocksDB). The encoding scheme is compatible with RocksDB StringAppendOperator merge operator.\r\n2. Support merge operations in ChangelogCheckpointing v2.\r\n3. Extend StateStore to support merge operation, and read multiple values for a single key (via a Iterator). Note that these changes are only supported for RocksDB currently.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  4. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed to support list values in the State Store. The changes are part of the work around adding new stateful streaming operator for arbitrary state mgmt that provides a bunch of new features listed in the SPIP JIRA here - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-45939\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes\r\nThis PR introduces a new state type (ListState) that users can use in their Spark streaming queries.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Added a new test suite for ListState to ensure the state produces correct results. \r\n2. Added additional testcases for input validation. \r\n3. Added tests for merge operator with RocksDB. \r\n4. Added tests for changelog checkpointing merge operator. \r\n5. Added tests for reading merged values in RocksDBStateStore. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a warning that instructs to install memory_profiler for memory profiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo inform users why calling a method like spark.showMemoryProfiles() would return empty results if the memory_profiler module isn't installed. \r\nBetter usability. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo behavior change, only a warning is added.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import memory_profiler\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'memory_profiler']\r\n\r\n... \r\n\r\n>>> spark.showMemoryProfiles()\r\nUserWarning: Memory profiling is disabled. To enable it, install 'memory-profiler' from PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/).\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-30T23:38:17Z","updated_at":"2024-01-31T01:56:03Z","closed_at":"2024-01-31T01:20:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"06b1c374df35c39fbe00096ee6e790b80482dcac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44958/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44958/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44958/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7264408ec913631528857c6df9d558da40442e35","head":{"label":"xinrong-meng:memory_warning","ref":"memory_warning","sha":"7264408ec913631528857c6df9d558da40442e35","user":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335786381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3ODYzODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"xinrong-meng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `Load New` button in `Master/HistoryServer` Log UI which assumes `/log` API additionally. In addition, this PR refactors all related logics into new `Utils` object in `deploy` module.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`log-view.js` assumes `/log` endpoints when a button is clicked.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/8e29c0d8c5cdc87d0a7358e090af864c4f03b1a8/core/src/main/resources/org/apache/spark/ui/static/log-view.js#L57-L67\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make `Load New` button work in `Master` and `History Server` like `Worker` or `Spark Driver` pages. Currently, we need to refresh the page to get a new result.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, `Master` and `History Server` Log Page features are not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-30T23:07:44Z","updated_at":"2024-01-31T02:19:44Z","closed_at":"2024-01-31T01:44:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ee27783725c002dcdb241b5c66091e3d54ccbf8e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Assign all config tables in the documentation to the new CSS class `spark-config`.\r\n  - Migrate the config table in `docs/sql-ref-ansi-compliance.md` from Markdown to HTML and assign it to this new CSS class as well.\r\n- Limit the width of the config tables to the width of the main content, and force words to break and wrap if necessary.\r\n- Remove a styling workaround for the documentation for `spark.worker.resourcesFile` that is not needed anymore thanks to these changes.\r\n- Remove some `.global` CSS rules that, due to their [specificity][specificity] interfere with our ability to assign simple rules that apply directly to elements.\r\n\r\n[specificity]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMany configs and config defaults have very long names that normally cannot wrap. This causes tables to overflow the viewport. An egregious example of this is `spark.scheduler.listenerbus.eventqueue.executorManagement.capacity`, which has a default of `spark.scheduler.listenerbus.eventqueue.capacity`.\r\n\r\nThis change will force these long strings to break and wrap, which will keep the table widths limited to the width of the overall content. Because we are hard-coding the column widths, some tables will look slightly worse with this new layout due to extra whitespace. I couldn't figure out a practical way to prevent that while also solving the main problem of table overflow.\r\n\r\nIn #44755 or #44756 (whichever approach gets accepted), these config tables will be generated automatically. This will give us the opportunity to improve the styling further by setting the column width dynamically based on the content. (This should be possible in CSS, but table styling in CSS is limited and we cannot use properties like `max-width`.) We will also be able to insert [word break opportunities][wbo] so that config names wrap in a more visually pleasing manner.\r\n\r\n[wbo]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/wbr\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it changes the presentation of tables, especially config tables, in the main documentation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI built the docs and compared them visually across `master` (left) and this branch (right).\r\n\r\n`sql-ref-ansi-compliance.html`:\r\n<img width=\"200px\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/1039369/1ad54764-e942-491a-8060-a23cdc2b1d3f\" /> <img width=\"200px\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for custom partition location assignment for Kafka sources in Structured Streaming.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n[Please see the design doc for greater detail and further discussion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RoEk_mt8AUh9sTQZ1NfzIuuYKf1zx6BP1K3IlJ2b8iM/edit#heading=h.pbt6pdb2jt5c)\r\n\r\n[SPARK-15406](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15406) Added Kafka consumer support to Spark Structured Streaming, but it did not add custom partition location assignment as a feature. The Structured Streaming Kafka consumer as it exists today evenly allocates Kafka topic partitions to executors without regard to Kafka broker rack information or executor location. This behavior can drive large cross-AZ networking costs in large deployments.\r\n\r\n[The design doc for SPARK-15406](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19t2rWe51x7tq2e5AOfrsM9qb8_m7BRuv9fel9i0PqR8/edit#heading=h.k36c6oyz89xw) described the ability to assign Kafka partitions to particular executors (a feature which would enable rack awareness), but it seems that feature was never implemented.\r\n\r\nFor DStreams users, there does seem to be a way to assign Kafka partitions to Spark executors in a custom fashion with [LocationStrategies.PreferFixed](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/connector/kafka-0-10/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/streaming/kafka010/LocationStrategy.scala#L69), so this sort of functionality has a precedent.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAn additional parameter will be accepted on the Kafka source provider. This parameter is provisionally named `partitionlocationassigner`. The parameter takes a class name, which when instantiated gives the Kafka source with user-provided Kafka partition location suggestions. The class should implement a new trait defined in this PR and described in the [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RoEk_mt8AUh9sTQZ1NfzIuuYKf1zx6BP1K3IlJ2b8iM/edit#heading=h.pbt6pdb2jt5c).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests are forthcoming. \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-30T18:52:48Z","updated_at":"2024-09-14T00:22:23Z","closed_at":"2024-09-14T00:22:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6811dfe5d47ffbc49fa4e186c389dad2834ebe35","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIt's not user-friendly to always wrap task runtime errors with `SparkException(\"Job aborted ...\")`, as users need to scroll down quite a bit to find the real error. This PR throws the user-facing runtime errors directly, which means the error defines error class and is not internal error.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes some error wrapping issues.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nReport errors better.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now users can see the actual error directly instead of looking for the cause of \"job aborted\" error.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer
