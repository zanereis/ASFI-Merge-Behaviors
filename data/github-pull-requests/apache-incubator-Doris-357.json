Proposed changes\r\n\r\n#4619 \r\nAdd time_round functions that provides `time_floor` & `time_ceil` at each time unit.\r\n\r\nFix two related bugs.\r\n- #4618 \r\n- Fix `struct TimeInterval` to use `int64_t` instead of `int32_t`, in case when the second diff overflow\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on (Fix #ISSUE), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] If this change need a document change, I have updated the document\r\n- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nThis change didn't match the style as `TIMESTAMPDIFF`, which has some syntactic sugar on the time units in FE. I'm not much familiar with this implementation, so I'm going to figure it out and make up for the documentation then.","created_at":"2020-09-21T10:31:48Z","updated_at":"2020-10-09T08:05:52Z","closed_at":"2020-10-09T08:05:52Z","merged_at":"2020-10-09T08:05:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"f3cdf167d12d4fd0a466e6a9f2f8b22cf97afe07","assignee":{"login":"morningman","id":2899462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2899462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman","html_url":"https://github.com/morningman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"morningman","id":2899462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2899462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman","html_url":"https://github.com/morningman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1099563192,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDk5NTYzMTky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/feature","name":"kind/feature","color":"c7def8","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue：#4592 \r\n\r\n* When the different partition of the table is updated frequently, the partition key list of the cache is discontinuous, and the partition key in the request cannot hit the key list in the cache, resulting in the access overrun，the BE will crash.\r\n\r\n* Add some unit test case，add test cases that fail to hit the boundary value of cache\r\n\r\n##

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n1. add date range check in `DateLiteral` for `FEFunctions`\r\n2. `select str_to_date(202009,'%Y%m')` and `select str_to_date(str,'%Y%m') from tb where tb.str = '202009'` will return same output `2020-09-00`.\r\n3. add support of zero-date to function `str_to_date()`,`date_format()` \r\n4. fix FE can calculate negative value bug, eg: `select str_to_date('-2020', '%Y')` will return `NULL` instead of date value.\r\n\r\ncurrent behavior is same as MySQL **without** sql_mode `NO_ZERO_IN_DATE` and `NO_ZERO_DATE`.\r\n\r\n**current behavior**\r\n```\r\nmysql> select

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nFor the task of rebalancing tablet among different disks on the same BE, I think it might be an effective strategy to ensure all tablets under the same partition evenly distribute on the different disks. Thus, it is necessary to obtain the distribution of tablets under the same partition between different disks on a BE. \r\n\r\nThis patch  add a new http interface for FE to acquire the distribution of tablets under each partition between different disks of a particular BE.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Ibe67a389235b716d260f600edf7a0f9d9d4242b4\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen the keystype of mv and base table is difference, Doris should execute sorting schema change instead of linked schema change.\r\nIf doesn't, the data size of mv actually is same as base table. This will cause mv to have no pre-aggregation effect at all.\r\nThe query will not choose mv.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixed this problem.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen I install a FE plugin developed by myself using command install plugin from ...; through mysql-client, the process of installation failed due to my code problems. After I modified the plugin code and reinstalled it using command install plugin from ...;, mysql-client reported an error that the plugin has already been installed. Thus, I used command uninstall plugin ...; to uninstall the plugin for the purpose of next reinstallation, and something unexpected happened that mysql-client reported an another error that the plugin does not exist. In other words，the modified plugin can not be reinstalled.\r\n\r\nThis is because of no catching error of the plugin. This patch try to catche the error of a plugin error. When a plugin error happened, it will delete the plugin zip file. Then the plugin can be reinstalled again, when it is fixed;\r\n\r\n**The issue is: https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/issues/4500**\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

can  set default configuration of database data quota and replica quota #4505#\r\n## Proposed changes\r\nWhen Doris create a  database, the database of data quota and replica quota is initialized by configuration(Config.default_db_data_quota_bytes and Config.default_db_replica_quota_bytes). In other words, I convert FeConstants.default_db_data_quota_bytes to Config.default_db_data_quota_bytes and convert FeConstants.default_db_replica_quota_size to Config.default_db_replica_quota_bytes. Config.default_db_data_quota_bytes and Config.default_db_replica_quota_bytes can be change in configuration file.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [-] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [-] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Submit a spark load job\r\n2. The job state is `PENDDING` at the beginning.\r\n3. cancel load job.\r\n4. Show load. And you can see the job state is `CANCELLED` with msg `user cancel`\r\n5. Open the web interface of the yarn cluster with browser, you can see that the spark job has been submitted successfully and is running well.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe spark job should not be submmited.\r\n\r\n**The reson of this Bug**\r\nWhen a user wants to cancel a loadjob in the pending phase, it is possible that the `appId` in the SparkLoadJob is empty,  causing the yarn command to fail, so we need to get the `appId` through the handle.\r\n\r\nIf the `appId` still cannot be get from handle, which means the spark mission hasn't been submitted, the spark launcher process should be killed to prevent the spark mission from being submitted to yarn cluster.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on (Fix #4518 ), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x]

broker load determines that it is 5 columns, and spark load determines that it is 4 columns.\r\n\r\nAnd there is another 4 columns source\r\n\r\n```\r\n1|1|jim|2\r\n2|1|grace|2\r\n3|2|tom|2\r\n4|3|bush|3\r\n5|3|helen|3\r\n5|3|helen|6\r\n6|3|helen|3\r\n6|3|helen|3\r\n...\r\n```\r\nGiven the same column terminator '|', both the broker load and spark load determines that it is 4 columns.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Submit a broker load.\r\n\r\n```\r\nload label ssb_db.broker_load_label \r\n( \r\n    data infile (\"hdfs://ymy-host:port/user/palo/table1\") \r\n    into table test_tbl \r\n    COLUMNS TERMINATED BY \"|\" \r\n    (k1,k2,name,clicks ) \r\n) \r\nwith broker \"doris\" (\"username\"  =  \"test\", \"password\"  =  \"test\");\r\n```\r\n2. Submit a spark load.\r\n\r\n```\r\nload label ssb_db.spark_load_label \r\n( data infile (\"hdfs://ymy-host:port/user/palo/table1\") \r\n    into table test_tbl \r\n    COLUMNS TERMINATED BY \"|\" \r\n    (k1,k2,name,clicks ) \r\n) with resource \"spark0\" \r\n(\"spark.executor.memory\"  =  \"24g\", \"spark.executor.cores\"  =  \"2\", \"spark.executor.instances\"  =  \"8\");\r\n```\r\n3. Broker Load will report an error \"quality not good enough to cancel\"\r\n\r\n**The reson of this bug**\r\nThis is because the first character and the last character of a line are not considered to be delimeter in spark load.\r\n \r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nfix #4519 \r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n**Restart when the state is ETL**\r\n1. Submit a spark load job\r\n2. Wait until the job state become `ETL`\r\n3. Restart FE\r\n4. Show load. And you can see the state of the job will always be stuck in ETL with progress 0%.\r\n5. Open the web interface of the yarn cluster with browser, you can see that the spark job has been submitted successfully and is running well and normally.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe job state should be ETL after FE restart. And the state will not stuck in ETL.\r\n\r\n**The Reson of this BUG**\r\nThis is because `SparkLoadAppHandle` in SparkLoadJob is not persisted, resulting in that an NPE error thrown in the ETL phase after FE restart, making the job state stay in the ETL state all the time.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on (Fix #4519), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis CL refactor the storage medium migration task process in BE.\r\nI did not modify the execution logic. Just extract part of the logic\r\nin the migration task and put it in `task_work_pool`.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the migration task is only used to process the migration\r\nfrom the specified tablet to the specified data dir.\r\n\r\nLater, we can use this task to migrate of tablets between different disks. #4476\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the
