SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR improved the Docker build for the websocket image, in particular by:\r\n\r\n- Using a lighter base image (`node:16-alpine`)\r\n- Using a multi-stage build to avoid dragging `devDependencies` in the PRD image\r\n- Not running as `root` (will prevent from exposing port < 1024)\r\n- Publish image to docker hub with the same tags and labels as the main image\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBrought down the image size from 380Mb to 42Mb - see the builds [published on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/oneacrefund/superset-websocket/tags)

user report an error where in SQL Lab an aysnc query would run for infinitum when the row limit was increased. The issue was the Celery worker crashed with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWorkerLostError: Worker exited prematurely: signal 9 (SIGKILL).\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt turns out the root cause was a call to `numpy.vectorize` function which per [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7078371/how-to-avoid-enormous-additional-memory-consumption-when-using-numpy-vectorize) can consume copious amounts of memory. The fix was merely to un-vectorize the logic using a iterator per the Numpy [documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.nditer.html#modifying-array-values), acknowledging that there may be a performance hit.\r\n\r\nNote this is the only place in the code base which uses the `numpy.vectorize` function.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git grep \"vectorize\"\r\nsuperset/result_set.py:    vstringify

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently Alerts & Reports only supports executing the report and alert queries as the `THUMBNAIL_SELENIUM_USER`. This can be problematic in a scenario where user impersonation is enabled and there isn't a service account that has full access to all datasources or Superset objects.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this, this PR adds a config option `ALERT_REPORTS_EXECUTE_AS` making it possible to execute reports as\r\n1. the creator if contained in the owners list\r\n2. the creator\r\n3. the last modifier if contained in the owners list\r\n4. the last modifier\r\n5. an owner (giving priority to the last modifier, then the creator if either is contained within the owners list, finally picking the first owner in the list)\r\n6. the `THUMBNAIL_SELENIUM_USER`\r\n\r\nThe config is a list of values, meaning that if the first option isn't found (e.g. in the case of alerts/reports created programmatically where the `created_by`, `changed_by` or `owners` is undefined), it will move to the next option. By default it will be set to use the `selenium` user so as to not introduce a breaking change.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe original dashboard auto-fresh intervals were hard-coded. However, based on the back-end query engine architecture, some options might not work. Move these options to config file so that they can be customized.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nWith default option, there is no change on the UI. Tested with customized options in config file. \r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105950525/197638482-e4e84f58-e9ae-4945-a7b3-ba54cfd6beff.mp4\r\n\r\nAlso verified the auto refresh function is still working as expected.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nIf testing with original options, no change is needed. Otherwise, change the options in the config file. Run `docker-compose up` and then view auto refresh options in any dashboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21248/ fixed a vulnerability issue where credentials stored in `encrypted_extra` were being displayed to all users who could see the database. Unfortunately the PR changed the schema used for databases CRUD (create, update, validate parameters, etc.) since one of the fields was renamed from `encrypted_extra` to `masked_encrypted_extra`. This is a breaking change that affected clients talking to Superset APIs.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds some pre-load validation to the schema, so that the old payload with `encrypted_extra` is still supported.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user tried to save a chart and a request executed by SaveModal chart failed, the modal would just close and there would be no indication that an error occurred. That might lead the user to think that their chart was successfully saved even though it wasn't.\r\nThis PR fixes that behaviour by not closing the modal and displaying an alert with error message within it. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/197514948-a996021b-bd5d-4939-aee5-c9f23c34b2d6.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/197514625-2667b4fe-519b-4313-be65-58e00a31c66f.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open the chart save modal\r\n2. Turn off the Internet (to trigger an error)\r\n3. Click save button \r\n4. See that the error is displayed and the modal doesn't close\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing

SUMMARY\r\nBump ECharts to latest version (5.4.0). Release notes since current 5.3.2 version:\r\n- 5.3.3: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/echarts/5.3.3-rc.1/RELEASE_NOTE.txt\r\n- 5.4.0: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/echarts/5.4.0-rc.1/RELEASE_NOTE.txt\r\n\r\nNotable changes for Superset:\r\n- Add support for confidence intervals with negative lower bounds. https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/17086\r\n- Fix for Pie charts when changing the percentage threshold or draw label lines control value in Explore: https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/17412\r\n\r\nThis addresses the regression introduced by #20408 that had to be reverted by  #20571 and adds storybooks for both confidence intervals and stacking with null values:\r\n\r\nConfidence interval storybook (note the lower bound displaying correctly with negative values):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/197322842-342b9d39-bcd4-4e57-9c65-b64b389cfcbf.png)\r\n\r\nStacking with null values (the repro case from #20571):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/197322850-87ae1ce3-bc18-4ed1-bac1-9197af6c416f.png)\r\n\r\nIn addition, a few previous storybooks were incorrectly using camelcase control values in the `formData` causing the `rawFormData` to render incorrectly, which lead to the x-axis formatter to not function properly. Now the x-axis displays with `smart_date` instead of showing epochs for all ECharts storybooks.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe Cypress test **`chart_list/list.test.ts` > Charts list > Cross-referenced dashboards** adds new dashboards but doesn't remove them, causing `dashboard_list/list.test.ts` to fail when testing sort order if the two test files end up run on the same worker/machine.  This PR adds an `after` clause that removes those dashboards, and also adds a `wait` that I think should help with making `chart_list/list.test.ts` less flaky.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"737\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-21 at 7 25 06 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/197310756-63187681-23ec-48e9-bd22-7d135270e3b0.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"748\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-21 at 7 24 56 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/197310761-df2b3433-2e09-42cb-a79e-b29401fc8504.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThere is no database driver for Amazon DynamoDB so far. I developed a Python DB API 2.0 (PEP 249) client for Amazon DynamoDB and did some work to be compatible with Superset. My Project is [here](https://github.com/passren/PyDynamoDB). The latest version is 0.4.2 which have already supported Superset connector.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7568620/197087136-5cf27f24-3e82-423a-af15-93caa50d9c1f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nThis is just a DB engine spec. No unit test required. For the setup in the Superset, please refer to the doc in my project.\r\nhttps://github.com/passren/PyDynamoDB/wiki/5.-Superset\r\n\r\nI tested in my Superset environment (v2.0) and it works.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, we are rendering HTML by default and using the following function to sanitize the content:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction isSafeMarkup(node: MarkdownAbstractSyntaxTree) {\r\n  return node.type === 'html' && node.value\r\n    ? !/(href|src)=\"(javascript|vbscript|file):.*\"/gim.test(node.value)\r\n    : true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis only blocks a small subset of potential attack vectors as you can easily see [here](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet.html). To improve the component's security this PR does the following:\r\n\r\n- Upgrades [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) from version 4.3.1 to 8.0.3. This will help with many security issues and also enable the use of some really cool plugins to extend our markdown capabilities.\r\n- Installs [rehype-raw](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-raw) to parse HTML content.\r\n- Installs [rehype-sanitize](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-sanitize) to sanitize the HTML content. By default, it uses the same schema used by GitHub to sanitize HTML, which means a more secure configuration.\r\n- Adds the `HTML_SANITIZATION` configuration option to enable/disable HTML sanitization.\r\n- Adds the `HTML_SANITIZATION_SCHEMA_EXTENSIONS` configuration option to extend the default schema in case someone has a controlled environment and wishes to use some blocked elements/attributes.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n- Make sure HTML is sanitized or not depending on the value of `HTML_SANITIZATION`\r\n- Make sure HTML sanitization reflects the extensions made in `HTML_SANITIZATION_SCHEMA_EXTENSIONS`\r\n- Make sure the examples that use markdown are correctly rendered\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-20T21:26:35Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T18:39:06Z","closed_at":"2022-11-04T14:34:03Z","merged_at":"2022-11-04T14:34:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"7d1df3b78d5d7147dd9d627317e3f9f10d279ae0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nytai","id":10255196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjU1MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10255196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai","html_url":"https://github.com/nytai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"rusackas","id":812905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjkwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas","html_url":"https://github.com/rusackas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bkyryliuk","id":5727938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mjc5Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5727938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk","html_url":"https://github.com/bkyryliuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jinghua-qa","id":81597121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTk3MTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81597121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa","html_url":"https://github.com/jinghua-qa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2793507342,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzkzNTA3MzQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/v2.0","name":"v2.0","color":"dddddd","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3950825814,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs7rfNFW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/v1.5","name":"v1.5","color":"EDBE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4530524848,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABDgpSsA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/v2.0.1","name":"v2.0.1","color":"AA0B81","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6575674535,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABh_DUpw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%9A%A2%202.1.0","name":"üö¢

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe \"Drill to detail by\" context menu submenu introduced in #21351 can end up offscreen, if there are enough menu items and you right-click close to the bottom of the viewport.  This PR uses the logic that currently handles that issue with the top-level context menu to also handle the issue for the submenu.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"947\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-20 at 3 12 59 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/197059380-b8198c3a-ef33-4d38-9697-06a3008f02a7.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"955\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-20 at 3 13 27 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/197059420-85b573d9-c9ee-4559-8586-ef41127f4272.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Run Superset with `DRILL_TO_DETAIL` set to `True`.\r\n2. Create a dashboard full of time-series bar charts with > 1 dimension.\r\n3. Try opening the drill to detail context menu all over the chart.  Submenu placement should be the default Y-position (slightly lower than the parent item) everywhere except near the bottom edge.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nFirst change to complete https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13125: We add a new configuration `DEFAULT_TIME_FILTER` to allow admins to set a global default time filter for any new explore charts. By default this is set to `None`, which replicates the previous behavior (`\"No filter\"`). To get a default filter of -1w the configuration can be set to `'Last week'` or any other value understood by Superset.\r\n\r\nThere is a minor change in behavior `UPDATE_FORM_DATA_BY_DATASOURCE` (when switching dataset in explore), the time filter is not reset anymore. This is similar to the behavior of other globally configured filters such as the row limit for explore, which also do not reset.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nNew explore chart with `DEFAULT_TIME_FILTER = None`:\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1842905/196846013-317773cd-21e7-4ee3-889c-a16803874426.png\" width=\"200\">\r\nNew explore chart with `DEFAULT_TIME_FILTER = \"Last week\"`:\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1842905/196845999-d4838206-18d8-4ba3-bbdc-a9d93bed3957.png\" width=\"200\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n#### Test default behavior\r\n1. Go to datasets and click on users (example dataset)\r\n2. Add `updated` (time) as a dimension (helps to verify)\r\n\r\n**Expected**: No time filter is applied when running the chart\r\n\r\n#### Test with new configuration\r\n1. Set `DEFAULT_TIME_FILTER = \"2020-06-01T00:00:00 : now\"` in `config.py`\r\n2. Go to datasets and click on users (example dataset)\r\n4. Add `updated` (time) as dimension (helps to verify)\r\n\r\n**Expected**: Default time filter is applied\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\nWhen a user switches to a tab before the slow table list fetch (such like db_exports) completed, it accidentally wiped out the current unsaved changes. This bug makes SQL Lab randomly resets the code to an earlier state.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the bug by updating the queryEditors object directly when the request queryEditor is not active state.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n- Before\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1392866/196775919-5261dc15-c4e3-4e40-bed7-ac677b208973.mov\r\n\r\n-

network throttle to slow 3G\r\n- Switch to other tab and then immediately switch to the another tab\r\n- Type anything on sqllab editor and then check any random revert\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR intends to fix that the categorical x-axis can't correct to render. This issue is caused by not getting the the label of column.\r\n\r\nWhen I fix this issue, I found another issue in the Adhoc Column control is that the query result can't apply the label of column (alias in the SQL) as well, but this issue requires extensive refactoring, which is beyond the scope of this PR. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/196658801-8b46c9d0-b7c6-4754-9862-af7b72997826.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/196657223-f1c57c71-54ef-4aa8-a140-e3088bafdd65.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/196657365-d5fd8800-13e8-44db-b843-3d163ac8c047.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

Edit a dataset with multiple temporal columns\r\n2. Disable all temporal columns and save\r\n3. Make sure the control is now empty\r\n4. Edit the dataset again and add two temporal columns and make one the default and save\r\n5. Make sure the default is picked in the control after saving\r\n6. Edit the dataset again and remove the default from temporal columns and save\r\n7. The control should have picked the first available temporal column\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nThe views for uploading data files (csv, excel etc.) to a database have form options to pass and/or infer `datetime` columns. However, the hive `df_to_sql` method does not support storing `datetime` columns as TIMESTAMPs in the Hive schema. It would be a nice for the `_get_hive_type` functionality to at least support the basic `datetime64[ns]` dtype.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nThe following steps require you to be able to upload files to a schema on Superset  (`allow_file_upload`) + use Hive as DB engine.\r\nSteps:\r\n1. Upload a csv with an inferable timestamp:\r\n```\r\ntest_column,timestamp\r\nsomething,2022-01-01T01:01:01.000000\r\n```\r\n2. Make sure `parse_dates` is set to the timestamp column in your csv file and `infer_datetime_format` is set to true within the form.\r\n3. Submit the CSV and confirm that the new table has a column with type TIMESTAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

SUMMARY\r\n`BigQuery` is now returning the project name twice in the error message when connecting, which breaks the Regex in the `custom_errors` dictionary, so we need to adjust it in order to stop displaying the general connection failed message. Also, we are updating the message displayed to users and the tests.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in order to actually being able to catch the right error, we are raising the exceptions with their original message instead of the default one, otherwise the exception handler will ignore it and display the default message.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n![error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/196283269-38a6f706-fadc-4282-837d-be0d2371b5ce.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/196283298-900b4552-3690-4dba-a9f1-fc245e14ec1f.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nAt Airbnb, there's reasonable amount of reporting about unintended overwritten of filter scopes settings.\r\nWe believe there must be unknown overwriting on json_metadata by other authors during editing. (json_metadata can be easily overwritten since it passes all attributes including unchanged values.)\r\nThis commit introduces the inspection step for this high volatility value changes and then proceed to update with the user's confirmation. (the inspection items are defined [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21819/files#diff-c070f1a491b40805e52139c971994f682921d2588cf1f06685d30ccf200cd419R44))\r\nThis commit also adds the logging for the user confirmation.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR removes a bar that was appearing at the bottom of the dashboard edit sidebar.  It does some misc cleanup along the way:\r\n- Removes `builder-sidepane.less`, which contains a few actively-used styles but is mostly unused styles, and moves the actively-used styles into the relevant component files\r\n- Replaces use of `react-sticky` with  CSS `position: sticky` (which seems to now be [supported](https://caniuse.com/css-sticky) for all of the browsers we're targeting) for the sidebar\r\n- Removes various styles and props that are now unnecessary because of above changes\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"900\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-13 at 8 21 07 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/195747350-71070bc3-6da5-4a3b-8d72-6a7f7fd81750.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![localhost_9000_superset_dashboard_10__native_filters_key=7nf2YdCXSNoo89wKJp6bQ0tjrlAX2AYcEkPxtZDcKB7rOM5_3bFogSmpuKjZxj1o (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/195747009-7742d050-522f-4c4d-bb38-109bfe57c13a.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Check that the bar is gone\r\n- Check that the Edit sidebar otherwise looks identical\r\n- Check that the Edit sidebar looks identical

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR brings a number of updates to the Helm chart:\r\n\r\n- Support running an optional `flower` ~~sidecar container in the celery beat pod~~ deployment, to visualize the tasks (but NOT exposed through the ingress, since most users probably don't want to expose this publicly - either a new ingress needs to be deployed, or a port-forward to the flower service is needed)\r\n- Support the optional deployment of a `superset-websocket` server in a separate pod, together with associated services and ingress path within the same host(s)\r\n- Reworked the probes to make them fully customizable through the `values.yaml`, added `startupProbes`, as well as a `livenessProbe` for the celery workers (that runs a `celery inspect ping` command)\r\n- Added an auto-generated `README`, using [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs), to document the contents of `values.yaml` (and should be visible from artifacthub)\r\n- Some minor cleanups, in particular switched all the `indent` to `nindent` so that we can apply indentation and improve readability\r\n\r\nThe more controversial change is also that I've removed the schema definition... I'm sorry but I've really find it too hard to work with, and was making iterative developments of the chart quite painfully slow, while not necessarily helping catch too many issues...\r\n\r\nI guess this is debatable, and if that's a problem I can work on restoring it, but I personally suggest to drop it since I think it creates unnecessary work - unless there's a tool to generate it that I'm not aware of?\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n- Deploy a new release of the chart. To enable the new features:\r\n  - set `supersetCeleryBeatFlower.enabled=true` to see the flower sidecar container in the celerybeat pod, and access the UI by port-forwarding its port 5555. WARNING this requires a custom Superset image that has `flower<1.0.0` installed (recent versions are causing a dependency conflict)\r\n  - set `supersetWebsockets.enabled=true` to see the superset-websocket pod (by default a custom image I've built from our fork, since there's no official one). It assumes that both pods are exposed through an ingress on the same domain (the built-in ingress will do this automatically) and requires various things:\r\n    - `JWT_SECRET` set as a secret env variable - it will be passed to both Superset and websocket servers\r\n    - in `superset_config.py`:\r\n      - `GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES_TRANSPORT=ws`\r\n      - A proper value for `GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES_WEBSOCKET_URL` (I use `f\"{re.sub('^http','ws',env('BASE_URL'))}/ws\"`)\r\n    - `GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES_JWT_SECRET=env(\"JWT_SECRET\")`\r\n\r\nThis was tested successfully on Superset 1.5.2\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-13T22:20:01Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T18:38:00Z","closed_at":"2022-10-27T20:03:22Z","merged_at":"2022-10-27T20:03:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"06da7bf65c5d7aaa2247faf826fa9e46653e82ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dpgaspar","id":4025227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjUyMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4025227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar","html_url":"https://github.com/dpgaspar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1332384320,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMyMzg0MzIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XXL","name":"size/XXL","color":"5A30DA","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6575674535,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABh_DUpw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%9A%A2%202.1.0","name":"üö¢

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nLike Presto, previously the \"table\" concept Trino represents both real tables and views which meant that there was overlap when fetching the combined table and view names. This was resolved by bumping the `trino-presto-client`  which per the [changelog](https://github.com/trinodb/trino-python-client/blob/master/CHANGES.md#release-03190) includes a number of fixes I authored with addresses these shortcomings.\r\n\r\nThis PR remedies said issue and:\r\n\r\n1. Cleans up the `get_table_names` and `get_view_names` docstrings\r\n3. Deprecates the undocumented `PRESTO_SPLIT_VIEWS_FROM_TABLES` feature flag*\r\n4. Cleans up Presto's integration tests\r\n\r\n\\*  This leverages learnings from the Trino changes where previously the implement for fetching views used the `information_schema.views` table which needs to compile the views as opposed to the `information_schemas.tables` with the appropriate filter.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n###

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR is an attempt to fix the Handlebars viz plugin, which currently raises both build and runtime errors, by updating Webpack and Babel config.\r\n\r\n#### Build warning\r\nWebpack would emit the following warning several times during build: `require.extensions is not supported by webpack. Use a loader instead.`.  The source listed was various lines in `./node_modules/handlebars/lib/index.js`.  According to the Handlebars GH project, this is due to the package not correctly indicating which build is client-side-compatible.  A [fix](https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/pull/1862) was merged, but it hasn't made it into an NPM-published release.  A workaround was recommended by [this comment](https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/issues/953#issuecomment-239874313) and is included in this PR.  This issue doesn't seem to be related to the runtime error and this fix just clears the build warning.\r\n\r\n#### Runtime error\r\nWhen rendering a Handlebars chart in Explore, the following error appears: `ReferenceError: exports is not defined`.  An inspection of the console shows that the culprit is the `just-handlebars-helpers` package's references to `exports`, as is standard in the CJS module system.  After some digging, I found [this comment](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/4039#issuecomment-419284940) that makes me think the problem is a CJS/ESM incompatibility: our Babel setup assumes all JS is ESM-style modules and therefore doesn't transpile CJS-style `require` and `module.exports` statements into `import`/`export` statements, and Webpack assumes Babel output is ESM-style modules and doesn't provide global `require`/`module.exports` that you'd find in a CJS environment, causing this error (`just-handlebars-helpers` seems to be CJS-only).  As suggested by the comment, I changed `sourceType` to `unambiguous` so it stops assuming modules are ESM-style and instead makes a guess based on the presence of `require`/`module.exports`.  This seems to fix the issue, though I don't have a great sense of what else this might affect.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"638\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-11 at 8 59 13 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/195239857-bcf58122-033f-4ef2-aeaf-78cee419efb1.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"897\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-11 at 8 59 24 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/195239878-7803d2ef-80ca-4a5a-9226-8a1d1ecf848c.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"638\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-11 at 9 00 27 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/195239925-9b694af4-9e52-468d-867b-32a070a9a370.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"895\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-11 at 9 00 35 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/195239937-e19fb700-19fe-4ec3-84dc-1934aac3bed5.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

issue with the `paginated_update` method which is used in a number of migrations. The problem is the pagination was not deterministic, i.e., per iteration it [slices](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/query.html#sqlalchemy.orm.Query.slice) the query via a SQL statement using an `OFFSET` and `LIMIT`. The issue is if the results are not ordered in a consistent way, i.e., by primary key, hence the ordering of sliced results is random meaning that a record may never be processed or processed multiple times.\r\n\r\n[Here's](https://github.com/apache/superset/search?q=paginated_update) is where the `paginated_update` method is called. It's used by the `assign_uuids` method, updating the `key_value` table, as well as migrating visualizations. The later is likely the only ones of concern given that the migration changes the visualization type which is part of the query filter and thus it continually skips over eligible records. Thankfully these migrations are actually only optional as the legacy visualization type is not deprecated. A future migration will be necessary regardless when the legacy visualization types are actually deprecated.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nResolves issue #21731 where date range in explore throws runtime error when explore.common is undefined in Redux state.  \r\nSee associated issue: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/21731\r\n\r\nThis issue is reproducible from the 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 RC1 releases but the change also improves runtime resilience of master.  PR is targeting master, but intended to be cherry picked into the 2.0.1 RC1 as well.\r\n\r\nChanges made in superset/superset-frontend/src/explore/components/controls/DateFilterControl/components/CustomFrame.tsx \r\n\r\nin PR https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20063/files#diff-ac08ce133d14a8a92607bf02bc368b6b52b8314ddef1b872e42746ba8d6038d0\r\n\r\nintroduced a bug that expects redux state to contain a path that may be undefined, and assume that a provided locale is valid and known by antd.  This fix ensures safety checks are made and that antd DatePicker can fall back to internal default is a compatible locale is not identified.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nSee associated issue: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/21731\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
