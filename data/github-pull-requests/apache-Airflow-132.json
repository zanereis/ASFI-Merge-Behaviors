PR adds explicit [permissions section](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions) to workflows. This is a security best practice because by default workflows run with [extended set of permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) (except from `on: pull_request` [from external forks](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)). By specifying any permission explicitly all others are set to none. By using the principle of least privilege the damage a compromised workflow can do (because of an [injection](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/) or compromised third party tool or action) is restricted.\r\nIt is recommended to have [most strict permissions on the top level](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#token-permissions) and grant write permissions on [job level](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs) case by

generated for Breeze Help can slightly differ, however we\r\nwant them to be generated always consistently. Therefore the images\r\nare now (when using pre-commit) generated inside the CI image rather\r\nthan locally.\r\n\r\nThis change also introduces much more selective image generation\r\nwhich will make the image generation much faster in case you\r\nchange any of breeze code. Previously, any change in any breeze\r\ncommand parameters triggered regeneration of the images.\r\nWith this change, only those commands that get changed get\r\nregenerated (and information about which images need to be regenerated\r\nis printed).\r\n\r\nThis change removes one of the Breeze setup commands - the hash\r\ngeneration - as it is now done internally by the regenerate command\r\nand does not need to be externalized (--check-only) flag provides\r\na way how to check if breeze images need regeneration.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

I opened it so that we can follow the work being done but this is still _Work In Progress_.\r\nFor more information, please see my [comment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/21225#issuecomment-1229250816)\r\n\r\n**First Edit**:\r\nAfter a lot of debugging through Celery / Kombu API, I think this behavior is not dealt by Celery. Right now, if I understand correctly the code base (which is not so much the case), here is what happens in the celery worker : \r\n\r\n1. Celery workers consume Redis queue.\r\n2. When Celery worker receives a message, before it executes it, it creates a Redis `set` called `unacked_index` for unacknowledged tasks, and one hashmap called `unacked`, to keep track of the message information.\r\n3. If the task run last more than the `visibility_timeout`, then celery worker (through the Kombu API) recreates a message in the main queue, through the informations saved in `unacked` hash and `unacked_index` set.\r\n\r\nThe issue with this workflow is, there is nothing to deal with the case where a worker is being shutdown exactly at the same moment at it is reading a message, and there is nothing in Redis to handle this behavior as well (like a [Three-way handshake](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-way_handshake)). The best would be to fix this issue directly in Celery, but I am still a lot confused by the code, and Airflow would need to take the last release with the fix when it is out, which can takes months. \r\n\r\nSo, to fix this bug, I suggest the following : \r\n1. Periodically take a look at the list of tasks contained in the redis queue, and noting those tasks which are **not** present but still with the status PENDING and not picked by any worker. This can only means two things:\r\n   * Either the task is being consumed by the worker and is second away from being executed / updated in the db\r\n   * The worker has actually shutdown while reading the message, popping the message from the queue, but never stored it in redis ackned hash\r\n3.  ... Therefore, save those PENDING tasks in a temporary list (because a worker might just have pop the msg from the list and is starting its own worflow and still hasn't updated the db)\r\n4.

one was a fun one to track down, and was only a problem when the scheduler \"expanded\" the first mapped task (making it SKIPPED).\r\n\r\n- The scheduler looks at `add_one` and marks it as SKIPPED.\r\n- `unfinished_tis` contains `add_one__1`, and `_are_premature_tis` changes the state of `add_one__1`, (which just so happens to be a leaf task), and the check on line 584 essentially gets confused, as no one envisaged the states changing!\r\n\r\nIn a reverse of how this normally plays out, if the mini_scheduler in the LocalTaskJob was disabled then this example DAG would deadlock every time. (Since that mini scheduler only operates on a partial DAG it can't ever change the whole DagRun state.)\r\n\r\nFixes #25200\r\n\r\nEphraim had the idea of the fix, I just optomized it to not check the (possibly) large list everytime but only when a state was changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is recommended practice to give a resource (pod/container) the least privileges it needs. The Airflow Helm Chart already supports configuring the security context on the pod level.

here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-container)).\r\n\r\nThis change is fully backwards compatible, as the `securityContext`

SnowflakeOperator always pushes the response of the cursor `fetchall` method in xcom if `do_xcom_push` is set to `true` It would be nice if we could allow the user to pass a custom handler that will act on the cursor if this handler is not passed then use the fetchall as default behaviour i.e current behaviour. this will give a user more control over using the other method which is available on the cursor also customizing the output result as required.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR is a small bugfix/tweak related to BigQueryGetDataOperator project_id implementation. After attempting to use the provided code, the operator wouldn't work because the `get_schema` method wasn't using the `project_id` parameter. \r\n\r\nAlso added the project_id to the log while attempting to debug this. Ended up being a nice to have in the operator.\r\n\r\nFix [#25782](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/25782)\r\n\r\nEdit: Ended up not creating a new branch in fork since I was excited to get my first PR in. If there is any changes that need to be made or I forgot anything, list them below and I will make them.

for issue regarding a mix up of variable names. The solution proposed changes the variable name `max_retires` to `max_polling_attempts`. Both names are currently accepted, but if `max_tries` is used, the user is shown a deprecation warning. Internally, the operators only use `max_polling_attempts`. If both are passed, but their values are not equal, an Exception is thrown.\r\n\r\ncloses: [#22381](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/22381)\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

BranchDateTimeOperator was sensitive to whether timezone\r\naware or timezone noive parameters were passed to it. Actually\r\nit worked a bit unpredictably - if use_task_logical_date was\r\nused, the lower/upper ranges were supposed to be timezone aware,\r\nbut when \"now()\" was used, the ranges were supposed to be timezone\r\nnaive. One of our examples has been broken because it was\r\ncomparing naive and aware datetime.\r\n\r\nThis PR coerces all values to timezone aware Pendulum datetime using\r\nthe timezone of the Dag, which makes it insensitive to whether the\r\naware or naive ranges have been used.\r\n\r\nAlso, we missed example in the howto showing logical date usage\r\n(and it was rather strange as logical date is the only reasonable\r\nusage of the operator - using utcnow() make the DAG essentially\r\nnon-idempotent - it's result depends on when the task is run which\r\nmight make sense in some cases but most of the time is something\r\nthat should be discouraged.\r\n\r\nThe documentation has been updated to explain that.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

I found few docs that explain how to add logging variables through `values.yaml` but couldn't find enough information to setup remote logging with S3 using IAM Roles for Service Accounts(IRSA).

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/25669\r\n**This PR does not change functionality(as requested in the issue) but only names.**\r\n\r\nWhy I think this name change is better?\r\n\r\n1. Jira is Atlassian product and its widely known as such. All atlassian products are under https://www.atlassian.com/\r\n\r\n2.  Unlike the previous case of mailing list discussion [Salesforce <-> Tableau](https://lists.apache.org/thread/t9fhhqsdb1x0clg21363s83v27orzk0f) issue https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/13614 here it makes sense to unite all under 1 provider:\r\n\r\n    -  Jira is known to be an Atlassian product. Tableau is not known to be a Salesforce product.\r\n    -  There is no specific site for Jira. There is one for Tableau.\r\n    -  Tableau has its own SDK in it's own domain [tableauserverclient](https://github.com/tableau/server-client-python)  while jira SDK is a module in [atlassian-python-api](https://pypi.org/project/atlassian-python-api/)\r\n\r\n3.  We will be able to support more Atlassian integration easily without need to have a new provider for each one of them. This is mentioned as motivation  in https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/25669\r\n\r\nPR info:\r\n1. No system test changes as jira provider doesn't have any\r\n2. No doc changes (except mandatory rst files) as jira provider doesn't have docs.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

reviewing the tutorials, I noticed that there were actually **three** tutorials spread across **two pages**:\r\n1. the main tutorial at `tutorial.rst`\r\n2. the example pipeline that is quietly nestled inside the Testing section of the main tutorial\r\n3. the taskflow tutorial \r\n\r\nBoth 1 and 3 are currently living at the top-level of the doc structure.
