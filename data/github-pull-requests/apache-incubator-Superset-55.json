re-addresses some of the issues https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20729 tried to fix which was closed in favor of https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21066 (which introduced a few regressions). Specifically it:\r\n\r\n1.  Moves the Presto/Trino compatible `latest_partition` and `latest_sub_partition` functions (and their dependencies)—which are exposed as macros—from the `PrestoEngineSpec` to the `PrestoBaseEngineSpec` so they can be leveraged by the `TrinoEngineSpec`.\r\n2. Adds missing facets to the `TrinoEngineSpec.extra_table_metadata` return value to include the latest partition spec, thus ensuing that the latest partition information is rendered in the left-hand panel. See the attached screenshot for details as previously this simply stated `latest partition:`. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1317\" alt=\"Screenshot

regression introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21943 where no context manger was used to create the engine, thus preventing users from being able to upload a CSV file via Hive.\r\n\r\nI thought both Pylint would have detected a \"Local variable referenced before assignment\" error, but maybe the if/context manager logic was simply too complex, as well as the unit tests—but alas this doesn't seem to be the case. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nTested

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAs a follow-up to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22369, this PR renames the legacy non-time-series Bar Chart to Bar Chart (legacy).  There is both a legacy Bar Chart and a legacy Time-series Bar Chart along with the non-legacy Time-series Bar Chart.  When `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` is on, the non-legacy Time-series Bar Chart is displayed as just Bar Chart, so both the new and the old Bar Chart currently end up with the same name.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![localhost_9000_explore__form_data_key=S0jPOlJ9DaKJe4hgtUS5zL_ZCpruQkGvN0YWVoVQH59eZWoUElFVk3X_TH-QH5Vb slice_id=75 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/207920022-29d20e95-c15c-4ad0-b336-cea27b95a74b.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![localhost_9000_explore__form_data_key=S0jPOlJ9DaKJe4hgtUS5zL_ZCpruQkGvN0YWVoVQH59eZWoUElFVk3X_TH-QH5Vb slice_id=75](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/207920069-35cae720-8a20-485d-a1d3-74bbf0ea2f1a.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR partially addresses recommendation #&#x2060;1 in https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14383 by defining the explicit bidirectional relationship mapping between the `SqlaTable` model (parent) and the corresponding `SqlMetric` and `TableColumn` models (children) to improve the performance of the `GET` `/api/v1/dataset/{pk}` endpoint—in conjunction with https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/pull/1961. This PR is a rehash of https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22332 after it was discovered there were numerous shortcomings.\r\n\r\nThe motivation was driven by a specific (and somewhat atypical) virtual dataset at Airbnb which is comprised of over 7,000 columns and 30,000 metrics where previously the `/api/v1/dataset/{pk}` endpoint would timeout due to:\r\n\r\n1. FAB was using [Joined Eager Loading](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/loading_relationships.html#joined-eager-loading) which \"eagerly\" loads the children alongside the parent, however this results in a slew of `LEFT OUTER JOIN`s which will rapidly result into a expansive interim result set—from a multiplicative combinatorial sense—given that the `SqlaTable` model has potentially multiple high cardinality relationships (owners, columns, metrics). Furthermore the result set—which is repetitive in nature—requires further overhead by SQLAlchemy to [de-duplicate](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/loading_relationships.html#joined-eager-loading-and-result-set-batching) the rows against the actual model record.\r\n2. Superset was using lazy loading (see [this](https://apache-superset.slack.com/archives/G013HAE6Y0K/p1670880289179439) Slack thread) when back referencing the `TableColumn.table` field when evaluating the `columns.type_generic` field which resulted in a `SELECT` statement per column, i.e., for each column it would execute a SQL statement to fetch the corresponding table ID.\r\n\r\nThe first issue is partially addressed in https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/pull/1961 in conjunction with this change—as FAB defers the relationship loading logic to Superset—which meant that the response time (excluding downloading of the payload) went from timing out to ~ 20 seconds. The second issue was addressed by defining eager loading of the back (parent) references which are pre-defined whilst fetching the `SqlaTable` model. This further reduced the response time to ~ 5 seconds. Note this PR is safe to  merge prior to the FAB change as in the context of FAB the `selectin`—a more extensible form of `select` which can be used when fetching multiple `SqlaTable` columns—relationship loading technique is ignored given that FAB is using an explicit [joinedload](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/loading_relationships.html#sqlalchemy.orm.joinedload) which is akin to `lazy=\"joined\"`.\r\n\r\nNote to further improve the performance of the `GET` `/api/v1/dataset/{pk}` endpoint all requests should likely provide a filter which includes only the subset of the columns required. This should both reduce the backend complexity as well as reduce the size of the response payload.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.

[uuid](https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid) and [@types/uuid](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/HEAD/types/uuid). These dependencies needed to be updated together.\nUpdates `uuid` from 8.3.2 to 9.0.0\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">uuid's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/compare/v8.3.2...v9.0.0\">9.0.0</a> (2022-09-05)</h2>\n<h3>⚠ BREAKING CHANGES</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Drop Node.js 10.x support. This library always aims at supporting one EOLed LTS release which by this time now is 12.x which has reached EOL 30 Apr 2022.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remove the minified UMD build from the package.</p>\n<p>Minified code is hard to audit and since this is a widely used library it seems more appropriate nowadays to optimize for auditability than to ship a legacy module format that, at best, serves educational purposes nowadays.</p>\n<p>For production browser use cases, users should be using a bundler. For educational purposes, today's online sandboxes like replit.com offer convenient ways to load npm modules, so the use case for UMD through repos like UNPKG or jsDelivr has largely vanished.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Drop IE 11 and Safari 10 support. Drop support for browsers that don't correctly implement const/let and default arguments, and no longer transpile the browser build to ES2015.</p>\n<p>This also removes the fallback on msCrypto instead of the crypto API.</p>\n<p>Browser tests are run in the first supported version of each supported browser and in the latest (as of this commit) version available on Browserstack.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>optimize uuid.v1 by 1.3x uuid.v4 by 4.3x (430%) (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/597\">#597</a>) (<a

SUMMARY\r\nWhen exploring a query containing a temporal column I noticed that the query would fail unless persisted as a virtual dataset when the `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` feature flag is enabled. Digging around I noticed that the `ExploreMixin` class in the `superset.models.helpers` module (introduced in #20281) duplicates essentially all logic from the \r\n`SqlaTable` class in the `superset.connectors.sqla.models` module. From a maintenance perspective this is highly problematic, as the SQLA connector model is by far one of the biggest pieces of tech debt in the backend with poor test coverage, while simultaneously being very fragile and frequently receiving minor tweaks/fixes. Duplicating this code without having tests in place to ensure that they're in sync makes it difficult for contributors to know that changes need to be applied in both modules.\r\n\r\nThis is just a hotfix to make the `ExploreMixin` class from the helpers module work with `GENERIC_CHART_AXES`. However, IMO we need to deduplicate this code ASAP, as they've already diverged quite a bit, with many fixes to the SQLA model not having made their way into the helpers module (#22280 is an example of such). I haven't reviewed the original PR, but a simple solution that comes to mind is removing the original logic and adding `ExploreMixin` to `SqlaTable`, which ensures that the legacy model (which is still the main one in use) uses the exact same logic as the new models.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow a query that hasn't been saved as a virtual dataset works with temporal filters:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/207261359-79c98aff-9fb4-45bd-801f-9707908ce53c.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously the same chart would fail.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/207261597-bc3d165d-2395-42bd-bb14-9c912bbbdb29.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

completed the Spanish translation manually after running \"./scripts/babel_update.sh\". We did not overwrite any previous translation besides the word \"Dashboard\" which was not translated.

bord\" in French.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we don't claim that the translation is 100% accurate but it is complete and a good start for other users to suggest changes based on the context of the

SUMMARY\r\nBecause of how the component structure changes when filters move in/out of \"More filters\" dropdown, the `FilterValue` component is getting unmounted and re-mounted, which causes the whole filter to rerender and resend its metadata query.\r\nTo prevent that behaviour, this PR uses `react-reverse-portal` to ensure that `FilterValue` component's lifecycle is independent of how its wrappers change. It's a similar pattern that we already use in `FilterControls` component.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/207066510-8e6f4b23-0ccc-4408-bd20-5964c7cb27d1.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/207066081-4b85e42b-11d9-4a6f-ad48-b84733c96754.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Enable `HORIZONTAL_FILTER_BAR` ff\r\n2. Add some filters and switch filter bar to horizontal mode\r\n3. Change window size so that some filters go into/out of \"More filters\" dropdown and observe that there is no spinner indicating that request is being made. Check that there are no new requests in Network tab\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\nFollowup to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21971, this PR makes a slight correction to print the string value of the logger level in the logs, and also passes in the error message. I'm also including the stack trace for warning level logs. \r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nIf you were to run this manually, you would see that error messages correctly say `A downstream exception occurred while generating a report` instead of `A downstream LoggerLevel.EXCEPTION occurred while generating a report` and also have an added message at the end of the log and a stack trace for both exceptions and warnings.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n-

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nRefactoring how we instantiate raw connections with the new `@contextmanager` pattern for instantiating sqlalchemy engines. With this PR, we can do the samething but with raw connections within the engine. Instead of instantiating the 2 contextmangers to get access to the connections users of this functions will only have make one call to get the proper context.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nPreviously, the `DropdownContainer` only showed the badge count when the value was greater than zero. When the badge count was updated, the button would change its width to incorporate the badge count. That behavior could really impact user experience because the position of the button can totally change if that needed extra space ends up pushing another element to the popover. To resolve that, this PR always displays the badge count even if the value is zero.\r\n\r\n@kasiazjc Another possible solution would be to have more spacing between the button elements when there's no badge and less spacing when there's a badge. The important part would be to keep a constant button width. Let me know if you prefer that approach.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR adds an Edit button (pencil icon next to title) to the filter cards that appear when hovering over a native filter in either vertical or horizontal mode.  The Edit button only appears in situations when the primary Add/Edit Filters button appears (when the user has edit dashboard permissions for the current dashboard).  Clicking the Edit button opens the Add/Edit Filters dashboard with the specified filter already selected.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore, admin/owner:\r\n<img width=\"914\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 2 45 13 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/206303450-b5d75e90-c30f-48ba-80a9-0347a81ad073.png\">\r\n\r\nBefore, viewer:\r\n<img width=\"924\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 2 45 29 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/206303464-65f35c21-667f-41eb-89f5-34a40a65d67d.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter, admin/owner:\r\n<img width=\"1081\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 2 44 49 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/206303509-b51c1bc4-a367-4023-9afd-5ba56adcd868.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter, viewer:\r\n<img width=\"866\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 2 44 57 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/206303538-328cde4b-d328-4215-8c20-e7a8a5108781.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Confirm that for a user with dashboard edit preferences (admin or dashboard owner), the edit button is visible and clicking it opens

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR adds the `visibilityToggle` prop to the input field to show/hide the password toggle functionality rather than just looking for fields called \"password\". I left the original check (props.name === \"password\") in order to ensure backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Go to the database connection modal and check that the password field still shows properly\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user was tried to reorder native filters placed in overflow dropdown in horizontal bar, the visual changes were not applied and filters were rendered in the same order as before. The problem was using a `key` property around rendered filter - since the `key={id}` wasn't changing when filters were reordered, React ignored the change and didn't redraw the filters.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/206274030-796e9535-7e09-49ea-a13a-0bb8a0e775cf.mov\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/206273709-c5e0b358-3769-4ba6-847c-ae7473c50f63.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Enable `HORIZONTAL_FILTERS_BAR` ff\r\n2. Add some filters, enough to make the overflow button appear\r\n3. Reorder filters rendered in the overflow dropdown\r\n4.

SUMMARY\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21573 we added a hook to load the driver for the database selected, but it was causing some runtime errors for gsheets, so I moved it to the base db connection modal component. \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nOpening a db connection modal edit screen for gsheets should work. Also, as a side effect, creating saving and editing databases should still work properly and should be passing a driver param to the api. \r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR re-introduces the defined dashboard access filter into Dashboard DAO get item method.\r\nCurrently viewing a list of dashboards and requesting a specific dashboard by its slug or id will allow for different access levels.\r\n\r\nI believe that access filters at the DAO level need to be applied on all methods (that fetch or mutate a not yet fetched item) and offer a coherent centralised first layer of security checks\r\n\r\nThis PR also:\r\n-  Changes HTTP response status codes for filter states, since a dashboard that a user does not have permission to access is automatically filtered at the DAO level, filter states for these dashboards will return 404 instead of 403 (Improved security)\r\n\r\n- Fixes a bug when using `DASHBOARD_RBAC`, currently on master, a Gamma user (for example) that has access to a dashboard using data access permissions can list the dashboard but can't render the dashboard itself (`/api/v1/dashboard/<id>` and `/api/v1/dashboard/<id>/charts/` returns HTTP 403). This happens because only `raise_for_dashboard_access` is called and not data access permission is previously checked.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe `encrypted_extra` field holds the keypair to authenticate to Snowflake. However, this field can't be imported currently.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/22348.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nHere are my test steps:\r\n1. Add a new Snowflake connection called \"Snowflake UI\" using the UI. Choose SQLAchemy as the option and use provide the keypair in the SECURE EXTRA [following the instruction](https://superset.apache.org/docs/databases/snowflake/).\r\n2. Construct a new snowflake-import.yaml in this format:\r\n```\r\ndatabases:\r\n  - database_name: Snowflake from Import\r\n    sqlalchemy_uri: $url\r\n    cache_timeout: null\r\n    expose_in_sqllab: true\r\n    allow_run_async: false\r\n    allow_ctas: false\r\n    allow_cvas: false\r\n    allow_csv_upload: false\r\n    version: 1.0.0\r\n    encrypted_extra: $encrypted_extra\r\n```\r\nwhere `$url` is the sqlachemy URL and `encrypted_extra` is the JSON encoded JSON block. So it looks something like this:\r\n```\r\n\"{\\n  \\\"auth_method\\\": \\\"keypair\\\",\\n  \\\"auth_params\\\": {\\n      \\\"privatekey_body\\\": \\\"-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----\\\\nblablabla\\\\n-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----\\\",\\n      \\\"privatekey_pass\\\": \\\"mypassword\\\"\\n  }\\n}\"\r\n```\r\n3. Run `superset import_datasources -p snowflake-import.yaml` \r\n4. Inspect that `dbs` table and verify that both the UI entry and the imported entry are identical.\r\n  - Of course, test the connection from the UI too. :)\r\n\r\nPrior to the fix, step 4 would fail. The `encrypted_extra` column would be empty for the imported entry.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\nFixes

SUMMARY\r\nCountry map seems to be not very clear when you have to see and check why specific color has been chosen for an area of the map. I think legend option is mandatory to improve readability of charts. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore was not possible to configure legend, now you can use specific parameters to obtain it:\r\n<img width=\"1360\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2301162/206148326-194a838d-91a5-4a92-9a4e-c1bec0223098.png\">\r\n\r\nI've added few new config props:\r\n- **LEGEND**: allow to set position of the legend (_None, Top, TopLeft, TopRight, Bottom, BottomLeft, BottomRight_)\r\n- **ORIENTATION**: vertical or horizontal (like a color gradient)\r\n- **FONT SIZE**: used to render each step of the legend.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nRun the application and create a new chart of type _Country Map_, you will see new parameters that can be used to customize visualization of the chart.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nI recently refactored the extraJson field  https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21523 so that we didn't have to do any data munging on database connection save, but rather can use the state that is in the local component and just push it to the api. The tricky situation here is that ace expects a string value, but we are pasting stringified objects into the field, so when we have to parse it later to add to the extra field, it also parses the ace contents. This pr makes the ace editor and input fields in the extra options component uncontrolled so that we don't have to parse the state back into a string again. \r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nYou should be able to edit the engine parameters field in the \"Other\" section of the database connection form on creation and edit for all databases. There should be no extra characters added to the editor as you type. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR is fixing the wrong error messages we are seeing with BigQuery after we introduced these changes: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22024 .\r\n\r\nInitially we were trying to get rid of `bigquery error:` section in the message, so we decided to split the exception message. However,  the engine is NOT adding such section into the message, instead it's just returning: `400 Syntax error: ...` for example, and it's us the ones adding that in this method: `extract_error_message` from the `BaseEngineSpec` class.\r\n\r\nSo, these proposed changes are not splitting the message, just getting the first line (if multiple), and we keep the `bigquery error:` section in it. We could also override the `extract_error_message` in `BigQueryEngineSpec` to remove that section, however, I'd like to be consistent with all our other engines.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 19 24 19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/206038084-165b0a9e-1cdf-49ec-9062-d857785c22a6.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 19 22 03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/206038107-6bcdfb8a-b9fd-48d4-a585-af867da42cc0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nFix missing margins around Select component in Adhoc Filter popover.\r\n\r\nMissing semicolon resulted in a conditional expression adding a prefix `undefined` to styles added with `css`

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPer [SIP-64](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14383) this PR adds the `/api/v1/dataset/{pk}/column` endpoints for obtaining just the columns associated with a dataset to aid the performance of the native filters.\r\n\r\nAs indicated in the SIP the `/api/v1/dataset/{pk}` endpoint is highly inefficient when fetching a dataset comprising of a large number of columns and/or metrics, i.e., specifically at Airbnb we have a virtual dataset which houses thousands of metrics and dimensions which results in an interim query which computes the cross product of `# metrics` x `# columns` x `# owners`—resulting in millions of rows.\r\n\r\nGiven the native filters only use the columns/metrics independently from the `/api/v1/dataset/{pk}` endpoint this PR simply adds a new endpoint to fetch only the columns metadata associated with said dataset.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests. Also tested the new endpoint with a dataset comprising of ~ 7,000 columns and the `/api/v1/dataset/{pk}/column` endpoint returned in ~ 1 second whereas `/api/v1/dataset/{pk}` timed out.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds support for generating user-specific thumbnails. This is a typical requirement in environments where some form of user impersonation is being used, and sharing thumbnails across all users with access to the same dashboards/charts could leak sensitive data.\r\n\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n- Renames `ReportScheduleExecutor` to `ExecutorType` so that it can be reused for thumbnails. Also moves the utils from the `reports` package to the `tasks` package, as it's shared with thumbnails now.\r\n- Adds a new package `thumbnails` to contain the thumbs-specific types etc. Also move the thumbnail task module here and deprecate the old one (it will still work, but will now emit a deprecation warning).\r\n- Adds a new executor type called `CURRENT_USER` which corresponds to the logged-in user that initiated the request. This user will be undefined for Alerts & Reports (=Celery has initiated those), but for thumbnails, this is the user that requested the thumbnail.\r\n- Adds the following config options:\r\n  - `THUMBNAIL_EXECUTE_AS` - similar config as for Alerts & Reports\r\n  - `THUMBNAIL_DASHBOARD_DIGEST_FUNC`: callback for generating custom digests for dashboards. This is handy if a deployment wants to use different hashing functions or use advanced logic for deciding if a thumbnail can be shared across a larger user pool or not.\r\n  - `THUMBNAIL_CHART_DIGEST_FUNC`: callback for generating custom digests for charts\r\n\r\nBy default the digests will stay unchanged, as the new default value for `THUMBNAIL_EXECUTE_AS = [ExecutorType.SELENIUM]`. However, when setting it to `[ExecutorType.CURRENT_USER]`, the username will be added to the `unique_string` prior to hashing to make it unique per user.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nThis chart thumbnail was cached using the following query on a Trino database connection using user impersonation with the following virtual dataset:\r\n```sql\r\nselect concat('Database: ', current_user) as user, 1 as num union all\r\nselect 'Jinja: {{ current_username() }}' as user, 2 as num\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/205628121-9af41c3d-1af3-49c0-a4a9-0be1563955c2.png)\r\n\r\nAs can be seen, both the `current_user` (rendered by Trino) and `{{ current_username() }}` (rendered by Superset) both show the user as being `v_brofeldt`, i.e. not a service account.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nWhen I changed the chart to reference a postgres database with basic auth using the username `postgres` and `THUMBNAIL_EXECUTE_AS = [ExecutorType.SELENIUM]` (=same as current behavior), the result was as follows:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/205628178-c4a67030-44fe-4fe2-a860-14f9c80acee3.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAs discovered as part of #22317, the `useCSSTextTruncation` hook had a difficult to track down bug: the effect responsible for updating the `isTruncated` value based on DOM measurements wouldn't run, even though console logs showed that values in its dependency array were changing.\r\n\r\nUpon investigation, it seems this is an intended behavior of React, as described by [this comment](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/24042#issuecomment-1104391636): even if dependency arrays change, React will abort the entire render cycle (including effects) if neither props, state nor context have changed.  Because the dependency array of the effect in question is currently based on values derived from refs, changes to these values don't indicate to React that the render cycle is \"worth it\", so if no other props, state or context changes in the component calling the hook, the render cycle is thrown out and the effect that would update the `isTruncated` value never runs.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, this PR removes the use of refs to store intermediate values and instead adds a new effect that runs every render and sets the `offsetWidth` and `scrollWidth` state variables to whatever the current DOM measurement is.  No dependency array or checks for changes are necessary to avoid infinite render cycles because updating state in functional components to the same value does not trigger a re-render.  This PR then updates the previously-existing effect to be much simpler, taking advantage of this same no-op behavior of setting the state to an existing value.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nExample that's broken in #22317:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/205420495-23b9c047-0554-4113-bd2e-1490a55489b0.mov\r\n\r\n#22317 after cherry-picking this commit:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/205420504-e03312e4-5a61-4c2a-8ff2-e9f799f2b2b3.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nCheck that truncation-based tooltips still work as expected wherever `useCSSTextTruncation` is used:\r\n- `DateFilterLabel` in Dashboard native filters (vertical + horizontal) and Explore ad-hoc filters\r\n- Horizontal filter bar dividers, non-overflow and overflow\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThere are edge cases where a bad / orphan component id can end up on a dashboard layout element's children array. When this happens it causes critical errors blocking critical dashboard behaviors. There is still some mystery around the workflow in the code that causes a bad id to get into the children array, but once it does it causes major issues. This PR makes the updateComponentParentsList runtime safe.  Additional fixes may be required to resolve underlying cause of bad ids ending up in the dashboard data but that is out of scope for this PR.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nNew unit tests added verify the code handles edge cases that were previously causing unhandled exceptions to be thrown.  \r\n\r\nThe existing unit tests were untouched to ensure the already tested behavior did not change.\r\n\r\nThe affected code in this PR is run every time a dashboard is opened, edited, saved.  Testing requires verification that general dashboard behaviors work as expected.  The steps below are not exhaustive or prescriptive but represent some paths for general testing of these changes.\r\n\r\n1. Open an existing dashboard, edit, save\r\n2. Navigate to a different dashboard, toggle between tabs if tabs exist\r\n3. Create a new dashboard, save, edt, save\r\n4. Re-load app verify new dashboard still works as expected\r\n\r\nYou can manually replicate the bad component id by injecting a bad id in https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/25114a7b97ca96341cdb2d5e6fceceddf6ebc3c4/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/actions/hydrate.js\r\n\r\nAdd:\r\n```\r\nObject.values(layout).some(element => {\r\n      if (element.id !== DASHBOARD_ROOT_ID) {\r\n        if (Array.isArray(element?.children)) {\r\n          element.children.push('FAKE_BAD_ID');\r\n          console.log(`ADDED FAKE ID ${element.id}`);\r\n          return true;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      return false;\r\n    });\r\n```\r\nafter line 263\r\n\r\nWith the fix the above code insertion should not cause any errors of failures on dashboard behavior.  If you add the above code in master without fix in this PR you should see various errors and odd behaviors as you interact, save, edit dashboards.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

SUMMARY\r\nWith the pandas pyathena driver, we are seeing some issues with null values for integer columns. The bug is happening at this point where we get a type error \r\n\r\n`TypeError: Unserializable object <NA> of type <class 'pandas._libs.missing.NAType'>` and then we catch the error and try to stringify it, which resulted in `pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Could not convert <NA> with type NAType: did not recognize Python value type when inferring an Arrow data type`\r\n\r\nFor this fix, I am returning `None` for all pandas <NA> values so that the printed value looks like other nullable printed values.\r\n\r\n### AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

schema should be able to fetch values that are integer types with null values. \r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR follows up on a few comments from previous PRs:\r\n- https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22288#discussion_r1036916081: Replaces use of fractional grid units with full grid units (with almost no visible change)\r\n- https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22260#discussion_r1035442923: Adds type guard for checking if native filter has a value set and removes now-unnecessary uses of `FilterWithDataMask`\r\n- https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22265: Adds an additional guard if the `HORIZONTAL_FILTER_BAR` feature flag is off, so Redux state will match behavior\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nNo visible changes\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- There shouldn't be any new lint/build errors\r\n- Horizontal overflow dividers should look (essentially) the same as before\r\n- If a filter bar is set to horizontal then the feature flag is turned off, checking the Redux state should show `filterBarOrientation` set to vertical\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [x] Required feature flags: `HORIZONTAL_FILTER_BAR`\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the Welcome page features an \"Examples\" tab for Dashboards and Charts. While this is ok for test environments utilizing the examples datasets/charts/dashboards, this is of little utility in production environments. To make the Welcome page more useful in Production environments, this PR adds a simple configuration option `WELCOME_PAGE_LAST_TAB` to show \"All\" charts/dashboards that would be accessible via the list views, and also makes it possible to define a custom title and filters for more custom use cases.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes the birth names example datasets, charts and dashboards, which unlike other examples, were created by the admin user, causing them not to show up on the Examples tab. I also decided to clean up some types along the way, and that turned into a pretty horrible journey 😱 I think I need to follow up with some additional cleanup later.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nBy changing `WELCOME_PAGE_LAST_TAB` to \"all\", the last tab displays all dashboards/charts that the users would see in their respective list views:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/205059819-9fadc621-8ad7-488d-8695-b7b0b99b4ca8.png)\r\n\r\nBy creating the following custom tab config, the last tab only shows charts/dashboards created by user number 10:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nWELCOME_PAGE_LAST_TAB = (\"Xyz\", [{\"col\": 'created_by', \"opr\": 'rel_o_m', \"value\": 10}])\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/205059916-c016a5df-2832-4c86-a045-b1327d792926.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously only examples were available in the dashboard and chart sections:\r\n<img width=\"1068\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/205060211-283994a3-874a-4bd1-b394-4e64a8bea2a7.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
