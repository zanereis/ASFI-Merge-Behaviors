deleting a VM snapshot, as it is performing the same operations via Libvirt. Also, there was an issue with the UI/localization changes in the prior PR, as that PR was altering the Volume snapshot behavior, but was altering the VM snapshot wording.

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix an issue when list affinity group, which can be reproduced by steps below\r\n(1) dedicate a host to a domain (for example ROOT)\r\n(2) create a vm in domain if not exist\r\n(3) stop the vm\r\n(4) change affinity group, affinity group cannot be listed.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3204966/78754009-0dee1f80-7977-11ea-8708-22c21613e5f6.png)\r\n(5) \"cloudmonkey list affinitygroups\" also fails.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3204966/78754029-16def100-7977-11ea-9023-e821938483a0.png)\r\n\r\nThis issue does not appear if there are other hosts dedicated to the account (not domain).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce.

pagesize/pages does not work perfectly. it will return\r\n(1) affinity groups to the account by pagesize/page\r\n(2) and all domain-level affinity groups.\r\nHowever, I think it is not a critical

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nWhile remove secondary nic from a Running vm, if update the default nic to the secondary nic before the nic is removed, the vm will not have default nic (and cannot be started) when both operations are completed.\r\n\r\nIt is because UpdateDefaultNic api is not handled as a vm work job (AddNicToVMCmd and RemoveNicFromVMCmd are), it is processed before nic is removed. The result is that secondary nic becomes default nic and got removed.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nWhen the static route service is not available on the VPC and a static route is created, the static route is created in a revoked state.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the UI doesn't distinguish between active or revoked static routes.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the missing state filter to the list routes command and only lists active routes in the UI.\r\nIt also ignores revoked routes when the private gateway is being removed but clears out the inactive routes before the gateway is removed.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev

Description\r\nSince PR #3956 has been merged the build time has increased drastically due to the quality tools added.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply removes these tools from the default build execution and adds a new profile with name: `quality` to enable these tools.\r\n\r\nTo enable this new profile, simply append: `-P quality` to the maven build command\r\n\r\nAs a result, the default build time increases significantly, as shown in the 'How has this been tested' section\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nTested on Ubuntu 19.10 laptop, 8x1.8Ghz CPU - 16GB

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n**New API endpoint to update size of Pod Management IP Range.**\r\n\r\nCurrently, pod management IP range can only be expanded under the same subnet. Editing the current pod IP management range is a challenge, especially as the list of IP ranges is greater than one. The purpose of this feature is to allow ADMINS to be able to update size of IP range of management pod, upwards or downwards.\r\n\r\nPR #2048 and [FS](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Expansion+of+Management+IP+Range) added two APIs(`createManagementNetworkIpRange` & `deleteManagementNetworkIpRange`). This feature is now in addition to the two APIs.\r\n\r\n**Brief description**\r\n\r\n- Updatepodmanagementnetworkiprange will update already existing IP ranges. Will not create a new IP range.\r\n- Will increase/reduce available IPs within the range.\r\n- PodID/Currentstartip/CurrentendIp are mandatory fields. Newstartip and Newendip are optional fields and when left blank, Newstartip will be set to Currentstartip and Newendip will be set to Currentendip.\r\n- Api only available to root admin and does not have any sensitive information passed.\r\n- Will output success response -true/false\r\n- Does not alter structure of DB, but will update contents.\r\n\r\n**When to use**\r\n\r\n- Reducing size of existing IP range\r\n- Increasing size of existing IP range\r\n\r\n**How to use**\r\n\r\nRun `list pods` command to see existing IP ranges\r\n```\r\n> list pods\r\n{\r\n  \"count\": 1,\r\n  \"pod\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"allocationstate\": \"Enabled\",\r\n      \"endip\": [\r\n        \"172.16.15.210\",\r\n        \"172.16.15.204\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"forsystemvms\": [\r\n        \"0\",\r\n        \"0\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"gateway\": \"172.16.15.1\",\r\n      \"id\": \"1407da22-a131-4dbd-86a3-45210a26897e\",\r\n      \"name\": \"POD0\",\r\n      \"netmask\": \"255.255.255.0\",\r\n      \"startip\": [\r\n        \"172.16.15.205\",\r\n        \"172.16.15.2\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"vlanid\": [\r\n        \"vlan://untagged\",\r\n        \"vlan://untagged\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"zoneid\": \"3ab731d6-efd5-418c-ab2b-cacbfc4b88f0\",\r\n      \"zonename\": \"Sandbox-simulator\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Update the IP range you'd like to change. In our case, we want to increase the range `172.16.15.205-172.16.15.210` to `172.16.15.205-172.16.15.215`. Use the command `update podmanagementnetworkiprange`\r\n\r\n```\r\n> update podmanagementnetworkiprange podid=1407da22-a131-4dbd-86a3-45210a26897e currentstartip=172.16.15.205 currentendip=172.16.15.210 newendip=172.16.15.215\r\n{\r\n  \"success\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTo reduce size of range to `172.16.15.205-172.16.15.207`\r\n```\r\n> update podmanagementnetworkiprange podid=1407da22-a131-4dbd-86a3-45210a26897e currentstartip=172.16.15.205 currentendip=172.16.15.215 newendip=172.16.15.207\r\n{\r\n  \"success\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\nConfirm by running `list pods` again\r\n```\r\n> list pods \r\n{\r\n  \"count\": 1,\r\n  \"pod\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"allocationstate\": \"Enabled\",\r\n      \"endip\": [\r\n        \"172.16.15.207\",\r\n        \"172.16.15.204\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"forsystemvms\": [\r\n        \"0\",\r\n        \"0\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"gateway\": \"172.16.15.1\",\r\n      \"id\": \"1407da22-a131-4dbd-86a3-45210a26897e\",\r\n      \"name\": \"POD0\",\r\n      \"netmask\": \"255.255.255.0\",\r\n      \"startip\": [\r\n        \"172.16.15.205\",\r\n        \"172.16.15.2\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"vlanid\": [\r\n        \"vlan://untagged\",\r\n        \"vlan://untagged\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"zoneid\": \"3ab731d6-efd5-418c-ab2b-cacbfc4b88f0\",\r\n      \"zonename\": \"Sandbox-simulator\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTouches on #2797 #2735 #3292 \r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nSubmitting multiple dynamic VM Scaling API commands for the same instance can result in two usage events in the same second causing a compound key violation in usage service\r\n\r\nRoot cause:\r\nEven though dynamic scaling job is handled in vmworkjob queue which ensures serilizing multiple jobs but the database updating and generating usage events are out of the job queue.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nMoved all updations into the job queue\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In

Scaling on a running VM with normal compute offering\r\n2. Scaling on a stopped VM with normal compute offering\r\n3. Scaling on a running VM with custom compute offering\r\n4. Scaling on stopped VM with custom compute offering\r\n5. Scaling on stopped/running VM between custom compute offering and normal compute offering and combinations among these. Checked if the custom parameters have been populated or deleted accordingly based on the offering to which the VM is scaled\r\n\r\nSince this is a corner scenario I could not test the exact point where two usage events are recorded at the same time for two different API calls on same VM.\r\n\r\nIn my testing found an NPE issue which is not related to my fix. I have fixed it and raised a separate PR https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/3998.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nCurrently in cloudstack there is no way to create a VPC Offering with a selected service offering, the service offering is always null. When a VPC router is created if the service offering is null a default Service Offering is chosen.\r\n\r\nThe following changes have been added:\r\n\r\n- listVpcOfferings endpoint will list what system service offering they were created with\r\n- the cloudstack ui will let you pick what serviceOfferingId to use\r\n- the cloudstack ui will let you edit the serviceOffering used by the vpcOffering\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n![addVpcOffering](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50488048/77345749-c2fcc700-6d3d-11ea-82cb-64429e800c01.PNG)\r\n![editOffering](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50488048/77345766-c85a1180-6d3d-11ea-9e93-05c2ec21da77.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nWrote a python test for testing create VPC offering with selected service offering\r\nSteps for validation\r\n\r\n- Create a system offering\r\n- Create VPC Offering by specifying all supported Services and your system offering\r\n- VPC offering should be created successfully\r\n\r\n[results.txt](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/files/4371015/results.txt)\r\n[runinfo.txt](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/files/4371016/runinfo.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--

Description\r\nI provided a fix for the error reported in issue # 3642\r\nDetails of the error can be found at: \r\n    https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/3642\r\n\r\n**Root cause of the problem:**\r\nThe incorrect error messages were found in the lines 431, 434 and 437 of the file - \r\n    server/src/main/java/org/apache/cloudstack/vm/VmImportManagerImpl.java\r\n\r\n_**Line #

Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI compiled the code after the changes and tested whether the error messages with the updated text are shown for these 3 scenarios of Server API exceptions:\r\n1. CPU cores not matching\r\n2. Memory not matching\r\n3. CPU speed not matching\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document

...to allow for easy inclusion of just this jar file into multiple packages, such as cloudstack-management and cloudstack-usage.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nPrior PR #2915 causes the cloudstack-usage daemon to not be able to find the mysql-ha jar file.\r\n\r\nThis happens because the /etc/default/cloudstack-usage file points to the old location for the mysql-ha jar file, and thus is unable to load it. This prior PR installs this jar into a more common area with other jar files, and thus is not really a desired location for the cloudstack-usage daemon to get it from, as it will cause cloudstack-usage to load other plugins that it doesn't need.\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\nFixes: #3974 \r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n_copy of PR #3649 on a joint account for easier cooperation._\r\n\r\nTested both cases:\r\n- Snapshot backed up on Secondary - manual and scheduled\r\n- Snapshot stored only on primary storage (works with KVM + Ceph only)\r\n\r\n**Note**: @GabrielBrascher changed the name of the strategy from _XenserverSnapshotStrategy_ to _DefaultSnapshotStrategy_ due to the fact that the \"Xenserver\" strategy handles also Ceph, KVM, and do return `StrategyPriority.DEFAULT` in any case except _REVERT_.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @Override\r\n    public StrategyPriority canHandle(Snapshot snapshot, SnapshotOperation op) {\r\n        if (SnapshotOperation.REVERT.equals(op)) {\r\n            long volumeId = snapshot.getVolumeId();\r\n            VolumeVO volumeVO = volumeDao.findById(volumeId);\r\n\r\n            if (volumeVO != null && ImageFormat.QCOW2.equals(volumeVO.getFormat())) {\r\n                return StrategyPriority.DEFAULT;\r\n

types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n\r\n## WHAT HAS BEEN FIXED / WORKs FINE:\r\n\r\n- VMware, KVM - no garbage on Secondary/Primary store (snapshot.backup.to.secondary=TRUE)👍 \r\n-- snapshot.backup.to.secondary=FALSE - works (by design) only with KVM+Ceph - no garbage on Secondary/Primary storage 👍 \r\n---  snapshot.backup.to.secondary=FALSE  does NOT work (by design) with other hypervisors/storage combo - so don't bother trying 😄 \r\n- ad-hoc single XenServer volume snapshot (i.e.NOT consecutive snaps/scheduled snaps 👎 )\r\n\r\n## WHAT HAS NOT BEEN FIXED (tracked via #4018 ):\r\n\r\n- **Major**: XenServer consecutive/scheduled volume snapshots, since having parent/child relation _(vs. VMware and KVM where consecutive/scheduled snaps are NOT chained (no parent/child relation))_ - continues to be broken - i.e. one can continue to create/use XS volume snaps, but they are not removed properly on Primary and Secondary storage and thus leave garbage all over the place - eventually, there might happen the \"Snapshot chain too long\" error from Xen (see #4018 for the possible workaround/fix and a bit more explanation on how it works atm) 👎 👎 👎 \r\n- **Minor**: VMware and KVM PRIMARY references (role_type=primary) are NOT removed from the snapshot_store_ref table - minor garbage, but to be fixed eventually 👎

Description\r\nThis feature introduces a simple DRS framework, which allows to add:\r\n- pluggable DRS providers - a DRS provider rebalances workloads (which can be virtual machines, volumes, etc) from a cluster of resources (hosts, storage pools, etc)\r\n- pluggable DRS rebalancing algorithms\r\n\r\nAlong with the framework, the following providers and algorithms are added to the framework:\r\n- a host resource provider, for virtual machines workloads\r\n- balanced and condensed rebalancing algorithms of workloads\r\n\r\n### Modules

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nThe file VirtualNetworkApplianceManagerImpl.java is edited for a related VM HA problem. When a Host is determined to be DOWN, CloudStack attempts to VM HA any affected routers. The problem is, when the host is determined to be down, by code referenced above, the host may not actually be DOWN. On KVM for example, the host is considered DOWN if the agent is stopped on the KVM host for too long. In that case, the VMs could still be running just fine... However when we think the host is DOWN, VM HA runs on the router and as part of that it unallocates/cleans-up the router and it's 169.x.x.x control IP is unallocated. Then after it cleans it up, it tries to power on the router on another host, and as part of that it allocates a NEW 169.x.x.x control IP and writes that to the DB. However, since the router isn't actually down (we just think the host is down) the VM HA fails as the vRouter is currently still running on the problem host.\r\n\r\nNext, in this example, when the host agent is back online again, it sends a power report to the mgmt servers, and the management servers think the router was powered-on OOB. However, the GUI will not show a control IP for the vRouter, and the DB will have the NEW control IP it tried to allocated during the failed VM HA event. Thus, leaving us unable to communicate with the vRouter.\r\n\r\nThis PR does a simple check that we can still communicate with the vRouter after any OOB power-on occurs. If we can, then we have the correct control IP in the DB and we're good - so we do nothing. If we can't communicate with the vRouter after the OOB power-on, we do a reboot of the vRouter to fix it.\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\nFixes: #8284 \r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

believe the router is down, but the host then sending a power report stating it is running:\r\n\r\n-- id = 157 is the row id of the virtual router in the table \r\n`update vm_instance set state='Stopped',power_state='PowerReportMissing',host_id=NULL where id=157;\r\n`\r\n\r\nI then observed that the router got marked as OOB started, and was considered healthy, and no further action was taken.\r\n\r\nI then ran the sql statement above again, to make cloudstack believe the router is down, and then connected to the router via cloudstack-ssh and took it to run level 1 via 'init 1' to effectively make it so that it cannot be connected to.\r\n\r\nI then observed that the router was restarted by cloudstack, and verified the logs on the management server\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nThe file VirtualNetworkApplianceManagerImpl.java is edited for a related VM HA problem. When a Host is determined to be DOWN, CloudStack attempts to VM HA any affected routers. The problem is, when the host is determined to be down, by code referenced above, the host may not actually be DOWN. On KVM for example, the host is considered DOWN if the agent is stopped on the KVM host for too long. In that case, the VMs could still be running just fine... However when we think the host is DOWN, VM HA runs on the router and as part of that it unallocates/cleans-up the router and it's 169.x.x.x control IP is unallocated. Then after it cleans it up, it tries to power on the router on another host, and as part of that it allocates a NEW 169.x.x.x control IP and writes that to the DB. However, since the router isn't actually down (we just think the host is down) the VM HA fails as the vRouter is currently still running on the problem host.\r\n\r\nNext, in this example, when the host agent is back online again, it sends a power report to the mgmt servers, and the management servers think the router was powered-on OOB. However, the GUI will not show a control IP for the vRouter, and the DB will have the NEW control IP it tried to allocated during the failed VM HA event. Thus, leaving us unable to communicate with the vRouter.\r\n\r\nThis PR does a simple check that we can still communicate with the vRouter after any OOB power-on occurs. If we can, then we have the correct control IP in the DB and we're good - so we do nothing. If we can't communicate with the vRouter after the OOB power-on, we do a reboot of the vRouter to fix it.\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

believe the router is down, but the host then sending a power report stating it is running:\r\n`\r\n-- id = 157 is the row id of the virtual router in the table\r\nupdate vm_instance set state='Stopped',power_state='PowerReportMissing',host_id=NULL where id=157;\r\n`\r\nI then observed that the router got marked as OOB started, and was considered healthy, and no further action was taken.\r\n\r\nI then ran the sql statement above again, to make cloudstack believe the router is down, and then connected to the router via cloudstack-ssh and took it to run level 1 via 'init 1' to

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nAdd ability to create alert for host status transitions, such as from Alert->Up or Up->Disconnected, etc.  Right now some transitions may alert, but we wanted to know about any major host status transition.  \r\n\r\nWe also created a ConfigKey (alert.on.host.transiton) that defaults to the current behavior of not alerting on transitions.  But, by changing the setting to True, we are alerted if there are host transitions.  Which we find helpful - especially as once in a great while we'll have a host transition out of an Up status to something else.  But we never get an alert that it transitioned back to Up (even if it happened 1 second later)....\r\n\r\nThe ConfigKey works in conjunction with a flag set on the FSM's transitions.  If the TransitionAlertFlag for a particular transition is set to True AND the ConfigKey is set to True then the alert will be raised.\r\n\r\nLet me know if 4.13 is OK or if you prefer a different branch instead of 4.13.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
