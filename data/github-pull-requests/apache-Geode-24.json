READY FOR MERGE YET**\r\n\r\nThis is the fix for [GEODE-8419](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-8419). I couldn't cherry-pick it directly from `develop` because `support/1.12` is missing some other changes that the GEODE-8419 fix on `develop` was dependent on. As a result I had to make the changes manually.

Windows PR checks to *every* PR.  However at least 8 times this year alone, this has led to changes being committed to develop that broke on Windows, stalling the pipeline.\r\n\r\nThis poses a problem, because even once you know your commit broke Windows, developers often have no way to test a fix.\r\n\r\nA comment from Kirk asked if we could find a way to request extra (Windows) PR checks only for certain PRs, e.g. opt-in once you have found yourself in the position of having to fix a Windows failure.\r\n\r\nThis enables the PR pipeline to do just that.  Ordinary PRs will continue to behave exactly as before.  However, if you add the GitHub label \"windows\" to the PR (just below the reviewers list), additional PR checks for Windows will be run as well.  They will never be required checks so as always, you are free to merge before they have finished if you already got what you needed.","created_at":"2020-09-30T04:17:25Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T14:09:37Z","closed_at":"2020-09-30T14:09:37Z","merged_at":"2020-09-30T14:09:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"bc28eb2246fe1538f5f403038db12789f9bff9bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/5572/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/5572/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5572/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/3aaedf75b7d14505c79893cd251fbc9615b1c3d7","head":{"label":"onichols-pivotal:GEODE-8561-allow-windows-PR-checks-to-be-requested-by-adding-label-to-PR","ref":"GEODE-8561-allow-windows-PR-checks-to-be-requested-by-adding-label-to-PR","sha":"3aaedf75b7d14505c79893cd251fbc9615b1c3d7","user":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114800905,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ4MDA5MDU=","name":"geode","full_name":"onichols-pivotal/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal/geode","description":"Apache

when possible\r\n\r\nInstead of storing dropped events in tmpDroppedEvents to later send batch\r\nremoval messages when the primary gateway sender is not started, try to send\r\nthe batch removal message when the event to be dropped is received.\r\nThat way, when the sender is stopped for a long time and there are events\r\ncoming, the memory of the AbstractGatewaySender will not grow with entries\r\nin the tmpDroppedEvents member.\r\n\r\nIn order to send the batch removal message directly, the eventProcessor for\r\nthe AbstractGatewaySender must have been created.\r\nIf it is not yet created because the sender was created with manual start\r\nset to true, while receiving events to be dropped, they will be stored in\r\ntmpDroppedEvents as there is no other choice. Nevertheless,\r\nin order to consume less memory, the event stored could be a simplified event\r\ncontaining only the necessary information to handle it.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the following unused methods:\r\n- getRandomAvailableTCPPortRange(int)\r\n- getRandomAvailableTCPPorts(int,bool)\r\n- getRandomAvailableTCPPortRangeKeepers(int)\r\n- getRandomAvailableTCPPortRangeKeepers(int,bool)\r\n\r\nRemoved two methods that used an ineffective, incorrect calculation to\r\ntry to distribute ports evenly across VMs:\r\n\r\n- getRandomAvailablePortForDUnitSite()\r\n- getRandomAvailableTCPPortsForDUnitSite()\r\n\r\nThese methods attempted to distribute ports by using the VM id as a\r\nmodulus. The intention was something like this (assuming 5 VMs):\r\n\r\nVM 1 would get ports 20001, 20006, 20011, 20016, ...\r\nVM 2 would get ports 20002, 20007, 20012, 20017, ...\r\nVM 3 would get ports 20003, 20008, 20013, 20018, ...\r\nVM 4 would get ports 20004, 20009, 20014, 20019, ...\r\nVM 5 would get ports 20000, 20005, 20010, 20015, ...\r\n\r\nBut the actual calculation distributed ports like this:\r\n\r\nVM 1: 20000, 20001, 20002, 20003, 20004, ...\r\nVM 2: 20000, 20002, 20004, 20006, 20008, ...\r\nVM 3: 20001, 20004, 20007, 20010, 20013, ...\r\nVM 4: 20000, 20004, 20008, 20012, 20016, ...\r\nVM 5: 20000, 20005, 20010, 20015, 20020, ...\r\n\r\n... with lots of potential port collisions from one VM to another.\r\n\r\nThe few uses of these methods were replaced by calls to existing methods\r\ngetRandomAvailableTCPPort() and getRandomAvailableTCPPorts(), which\r\noffer a more reliable method of distributing ports.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `develop`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does `gradlew build` run cleanly?\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, check Concourse for build issues and\r\nsubmit an update to your PR as soon as possible.
